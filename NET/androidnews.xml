                    <p><p><em><strong>Not the upgrade you want</strong></em></p><p>The DiskStation DS925+ brings several key upgrades, such as dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports at the back, and a quad-core Ryzen platform. The result is that the NAS has a definite edge over the DS923+ if you need a little bit of additional power, but the gains are overshadowed by a controversial HDD policy. Essentially, you can't use any other brand's HDDs with the DS925+, and that severely restricts your choices. Not being able to use regular Seagate and WD drives, and having to buy costlier Synology-branded hard drives just doesn't make sense, and it ultimately makes the DS925+ a non-starter. </p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Still a great choice</strong></em></p><p>If you have to choose a model from these two, I'd suggest going with the DiskStation DS923+. It uses a dual-core Ryzen platform, but it's plenty fast in daily use, and you get the best software platform around. Although the DS923+ is a few years old at this point, the NAS doesn't have any limitations beyond the Gigabit Ethernet ports, and if you need multi-Gigabit connectivity, you can upgrade to a 10GbE card without a hassle. And considering there are no restrictions around HDD use, the DS923+ makes better sense than the DS925+ — so grab it while it's still available. </p></p>

<p>Synology hasn't changed its design in 10 years, so both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">DiskStation DS925+</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> are practically identical. They both use the same black chassis with a vented design at the sides to allow passive cooling, and there are dual 92mm fans at the rear. <br><br>The design is unobtrusive, and the aluminum construction means it is durable. I haven't had any issues with the DS923+ whatsoever even with extended use, and the DS925+ should be the same. The power button is located on the right, and you get status LED indicators and a USB-A port on the same side.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gCBPw4HbpRm3zrBddLN66M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCBPw4HbpRm3zrBddLN66M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive bays are easy to access, and they can be locked should you wish to do so. Installing 3.5-inch HDDs is about as straightforward as it gets, and it doesn't require any tools. If you need to slot in a 2.5-inch SSD instead, you'll need to mount it to the drive bay.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9KeYecHjbYfmJiXSqec6un" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-5.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9KeYecHjbYfmJiXSqec6un.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching to the back, you get a USB port as standard, and the underside of both NAS servers has two M.2 slots if you want to add SSDs. The DiskStation DS925+ is notable as it comes with two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, giving it a good upgrade over the DS923+, which has Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. The DS925+ also uses USB-C to expand drives should you need to down the line, with the DS923+ coming with an eSATA port instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's great to see multi-Gigabit connectivity available by default, the DS925+ doesn't have a way to switch to 10GbE networking — unlike the DS923+. You can easily add a 10GbE card to the DS923+ thanks to the connector at the rear, and it gives the NAS greater flexibility.</p>

<p>Both NAS models have the exact same software, so there isn't anything to differentiate either product in this area. That said, the DiskStation DS925+ comes with a quad-core Ryzen V1500B, and it holds up better with demanding workloads. That isn't to say that the DS923+ is any slouch in this area — it's just that the DS925+ has a little additional headroom. The rest of the hardware is identical, with both NAS systems coming with 4GB RAM pre-installed. <br><br>The main reason to buy Synology NAS servers is the DiskStation Manager (DSM) software, and the brand continues to do a great job delivering useful features and standout mobile clients. It's effortless to upload photos and data from your phones automatically to either NAS, and you get powerful utilities that provide a local alternative to cloud-based solutions. <br><br>The biggest issue with the DiskStation DS925+ is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-brings-severe-hard-drive-limitations-to-diskstation-models-and-im-pissed">limitation around hard drive use</a>. While you can use any Seagate IronWolf, WD Red, or any other hard drive in the DiskStation DS923+, that isn't possible with the DS925+; Synology is now enforcing the use of its own drives, and unless you do so, you won't even be able to install the DSM software and boot into the NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cqTszDpeHcMnwvPsAUgKvL" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqTszDpeHcMnwvPsAUgKvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This arbitrary restriction has huge ramifications, as Synology's drives tend to cost more than their equivalent Seagate and Western Digital rivals. The brand says it is doing this to ensure greater reliability, but it hasn't published any meaningful data around how its drives last longer than other NAS HDDs. <br><br>Both servers do a good job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex NAS</a>; there are no issues with playback, and remote streaming is easy to set up and use. That said, the AMD-based hardware doesn't come with transcoding, so you miss out on this feature. That's true with both the DS925+ and DS923+, so if you use Plex Pass and need transcoding,</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-15.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CwTWhizVW7LyeyQY2yzx24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It just doesn't make much sense to buy the DiskStation DS925+. While it has better hardware and multi-Gigabit connectivity out of the box, the hard drive restrictions curb its usability to a noticeable extent. Don't get me wrong; the DS925+ is still a great NAS, and if you don't care about the hard drive limitations, you should consider getting it. <br><br>But with the DiskStation DS923+ still available, the older NAS is a better choice in 2025. While the Gigabit Ethernet ports are showing their age, you can add a 10GbE networking card by shelling out an additional $100, and there are no restrictions around HDD use — you can buy any Seagate, Toshiba, and WD drive you want and slot it into the NAS. <br><br>Given the changes with the DS925+, I'd suggest getting the DS923+ while it's still available. It continues to be a reliable 4-bay Plex NAS in 2025, and it isn't intentionally hobbled.</p>

<p>First, I picked through the runner summaries COROS sent for Yalemzerf Yehualaw (3rd place), Emma Bates (13th), Des Linden (17th), Charlie Sweeney (19th), and Reed Fischer (21st), all top-tier runners for one of the most famous races in the world.</p><p>All of COROS' Boston Marathon team wore either the $349 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a> (Linden) or $229 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> (Bates, Yalemzerf, Sweeney). It's pretty cool knowing they use the same tools as everyday runners to analyze their own stats — and that you can directly compare your data against theirs to provide humbling context and insight.</p><p>COROS was also kind enough to send a spreadsheet of per-mile stats for Bates, Fischer, and Linden for their pace, cadence, average/ max heart rate, and the changes from one mile to the next — or lack thereof — is fascinating and enlightening.</p><p>Here's what I gleaned from looking through these pro runner stats!</p>
<h2 id="consistency-is-vital-2">Consistency is vital</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="c7ELnAoa6Apf82YPsdzsy9" name="Reed-Fischer-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Reed Fischer's per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025 and 2022." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c7ELnAoa6Apf82YPsdzsy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1167" height="656" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Reed Fischer's per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025 and 2022 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From miles 2 through 16, Reed Fischer's pace never changed by more than 6 seconds. And from mile 5 onwards, his average heart rate stayed in the same 170–176 range — while his average and max HR were almost always within 1–2 bpm.</p><p>Des Linden's average cadence fell between 188–191 steps per minute for the entire race until the final 0.2-mile sprint to the finish. Even when her pace dipped and stride lost power, she kept the same speed of her form, and her per-mile pace was remarkably consistent even across elevation changes.</p><p>I don't have Yehualaw's per-mile stats, but it's very telling that the gap between her fastest and average kilometer is only 20 seconds. And Linden, a role model for running longevity at 43, only had a 5-second gap between her mile-1 and mile-26 times, and a 33-second gap between her fastest and slowest mile.</p><p>These stats are a great reminder that you don't want to let your fellow runners dictate your pace. Even when you're in the zone and feeling great, you must restrain yourself, stick within your capabilities, and keep your heart pumping to the beat of a metronome.</p>
<h2 id="you-re-probably-trying-too-hard-2">You're probably trying too hard</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1330px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eDdaY4S4hifQmPbsAevC5A" name="Emma-Bates-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Emma Bates' per-mile stats for the past three Boston Marathons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eDdaY4S4hifQmPbsAevC5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1330" height="748" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Emma Bates' per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025, 2024, and 2023 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know these athletes' actual max HRs or lactate thresholds, but the "220 minus age" estimate shows me that all these runners were <em>probably</em> running, on average, right at the border between Zone 4 and 5 for most of their run. That's certainly not easy, but they rarely approach their max effort.</p><p>In fact, their heart rate tends to <em>dip</em> in the final miles; they ease off their pace to stick to what their bodies are capable of.</p><p>COROS has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/stories/athlete-stories/c/effort-pace-the-journey-of-coros-metric-of-the-future">"Effort Pace"</a> metric that combines grade-adjusted pace (GAP) with your ability level to judge how hard you're working to hit a pace and adjusting the speed accordingly. By and large, these runners' effort pace was almost always lower than their <em>real</em> pace; they didn't push harder than their usual abilities, even for the biggest race of the year.</p><p>Fischer's first four miles did show a higher effort pace than actual pace, which I'd guess stems from him trying to stick with the faster leaders for the first 5K. Once he fell behind, his pace became more efficient and within his means.</p><p>Our goal, then, should be to keep at a similarly consistent heart rate and foot speed for our races rather than trying to outperform our capabilities and burn out in the later miles. If you want to go faster, build up your speed and endurance until you can naturally maintain a faster cadence.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-no-shortcut-for-getting-faster-2">There's no shortcut for getting faster</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.43%;"><img id="cqvYdCxfBVPLuRMfh9FCAA" name="Des-Linden-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Des Linden's per-mile stats for the past five Boston Marathons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqvYdCxfBVPLuRMfh9FCAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2034" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Des Linden's per-mile stats for five Boston Marathons from 2021–2025 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I averaged about 25 spm fewer than Charley Sweeney (who is my height) in my recent half-marathon PR, or 14 spm fewer during a max-effort interval workout. That's not a surprise or anything; just like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">I tried to match Olympic paces on my local track</a>, I know my running capabilities are firmly amateur.</p><p>But it did tempt me to consider whether I should try to change my running form to aim for faster step speed...until I remembered the time I asked Garmin Forerunner product manager Joe Heikes<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form"> how to improve my running form</a>. He basically warned me <em>not</em> to.</p><p>Any self-correction to change your natural form will lead to "less economical running," Heikes said, and runners should instead use form data like cadence as a benchmark; the lighter, faster, and stronger you get, the less wasted movement and slow turnover you should see without any conscious changes.</p><p>If there <em>is</em> a way to improve your form, it's with strength training to make your muscles capable of the extra impact. COROS coaches suggest burpees, mountain climbers, and other bodyweight jumps for faster ground contact time and lower-body exercises like squats, deadlifts, and calf/heel raises for a stronger stride.</p><p>The main point being, if I want to emulate these athletes' foot speed, it's arguably just as much about strength as endurance. These stats were a bit of a wake-up call to stop neglecting my cross-training.</p>
<h2 id="emulating-their-approach-only-slower-2">Emulating their approach (only slower)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ" name="Four-watches-20-mile-running-test" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2, Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, and Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf together, all showing a post-run summary for a 20-mile race that day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I finished my 20-mile race about an hour slower than these runners finished a marathon.

<p>Plenty of amateur runners will look at these stats and get discouraged, knowing they couldn't run one mile as fast as these athletes' <em>slowest</em> Boston Marathon mile.</p><p>I look at it differently. I know that I can't run that fast, obviously, but I <em>can</em> emulate their race tactics.</p><p>My per-mile efficiency or performance condition stats show the turning point when I have to start using more effort at a higher heart rate than I should; the goal is to push that point further back.</p><p>During a race, I need to practice consistent pace and heart rate habits. Rather than just sink into the zone and run at a pace that feels right until my legs give out, I can use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> data to stay at a pace I can manage, particularly in the early miles when it's easy to get carried away.</p>

While the free tier has an exhaustive feature-set in its own right, you'll need to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex-pass">Plex Pass</a> to unlock the best utility, including hardware-assisted transcoding, ability to download content on mobile devices, advanced controls, and skip intros — what I use the most. <br><br>Plex Pass costs $4.99 a month, $39.99 annually, and is available as a lifetime sub that'll set you back $119.99. These prices have been unchanged for the better part of a decade, but Plex is now starting to raise prices across the board. Starting April 29, the monthly plan will cost $6.99, yearly plan is going up to $69.99, and the lifetime option will cost $249.99. <br><br>In addition to the price hike, Plex is moving the oft-used remote streaming option behind Plex Pass, so you will need to subscribe to a paid plan if you share your Plex library with your friends or family. The good news is that the older pricing is still available, so if you use the service and want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/">subscribe to the lifetime plan at $119.99</a>, now is the best time to do it. <br><br>I bought Plex Pass a half-decade ago while it was under $100, and it has easily paid for itself in that time. While I don't use the transcoding option, all the other value additions with Plex Pass make it an easy recommendation, and given that sharing your library requires the paid sub, I'd suggest getting in on the old pricing before April 29. <br><br>On that note, Plex <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/important-2025-plex-updates/">clarified in a blog post</a> that if you're sharing your library, only you'll need Plex Pass; those you share it with will be able to access it on the free tier. That's the right move, so if you've relied on this feature in the past, you may want to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/">getting Plex Pass right now</a>.</p>

<p>Motorola just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">unveiled</a> its new Razr 2025 series, and the company is taking a page out of Samsung's book in North America by launching a trio of devices. After the previous two generations only came with two phones, I think Motorola was smart to tweak its lineup for a more aggressive strategy, and Samsung may want to take note.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a> comprises the base Razr 2025, the Razr Plus 2025, and the Razr Ultra 2025. The latter is the newest addition to the lineup, offering premium specs with a premium price tag. The entire lineup spans a wide range of prices, starting at $699 and ranging up to $ 1,299. By contrast, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which comprises a base S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra, ranges from $799 to $1,299 as the starting prices for each model.</p><p>When I asked Motorola why it decided on three Razr devices for 2025, it said that it's “expanding the family to provide consumers with more options at various price points.”</p><p>This makes sense as Motorola is known for offering devices with plenty of value at a lower price point (Razr 2025) while the company is also trying to better establish itself in the premium Android market (Razr Ultra 2025). This gives Motorola a broad reach with consumers, something Samsung has capitalized on with its flagship series.</p>
<h2 id="three-s-company-2">Three's company</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, we're accustomed to Samsung offering three flagship models (excluding the upcoming Edge), a trend it has maintained for several generations. Apparently, it works out well for the company; otherwise, it would have ditched the strategy long ago. In fact, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, Samsung appears poised to double down on this strategy, highlighting how more choice is indeed better.</p><p>Yet, despite the similar naming strategy, Motorola isn't copying Samsung completely. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> phones offer different specs, from the chipset to the camera setup, which is how Motorola has been able to bring the price lower than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. After all, we are dealing with foldable phones here, which often cost more than traditional candybar phones.</p><p>Motorola updated the Razr 2025 chip with the AI-ready <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">Dimensity 7400X</a>, which isn't an expensive flagship chip, but a more cost-effective midrange chip that should be more than capable for a $700 phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-1" alt="The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees, noting that Motorola now has the sales volume to support a three-product lineup.</p><p>“They are also moving up market with a true flagship model that beats the competition in every spec while still offering more affordable alternatives, creating the halo effect,” Sag tells me in an email.</p><p>That “true flagship model” costs a whopping $1,299, which is a $300 premium over last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> and $200 more than the already-expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. It also costs the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, despite offering significantly better specs, including more RAM, increased base storage, and faster charging, among other advantages.</p><p>That's a pretty penny that could give some consumers pause. However, this may not be as much of a deterrent as I initially thought it would be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“I don’t think it will be much of a problem since the company is offering a sliding scale of capabilities and for those who care for the specs, the Ultra is the perfect model,” Sag explains. “The Ultra is very competitive as a flagship, and I think [it] will get the brand a lot of attention.”</p><p>Like Samsung, Motorola clearly wants you to buy its premium offering, while still making it easy for you to get a similar experience with two cheaper models based on what you can afford and what you want out of your phone. Even if that means making meager changes with the Razr and Razr Plus.</p>
<h2 id="middle-child-syndrome-2">Middle child syndrome</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Jzmc9pbgmjbDYe3mh5kaK3" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025-hands-on" alt="Different colors and finishes of the Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jzmc9pbgmjbDYe3mh5kaK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2025 introduced a few notable changes, including a larger battery and an updated chipset. However, the Razr Plus 2025 is largely the same as last year's Plus model in terms of specs. Just by looking at it, you'd think they were the same phone (because they almost are).</p><p>This was the biggest question mark for me with Razr’s new strategy. We've definitely complained about companies making very few changes with their new phones, and this kinda takes the cake. That's not to say it isn't a good phone; I still love my Razr Plus 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola made sure to point out to me how this 2025 model is still an upgrade from its predecessor.</p><p>“The key improvements include the suite of new Moto AI experiences, the redesigned titanium-reinforced hinge, the first flip phones with Pantone validated color and skin tones, and robust IP48 dust and underwater protection."</p><p>That's not nothing, and the Pantone-enhanced display and cameras actually sound pretty good to me. However, like Samsung's Galaxy S Plus devices, I worry that the new Razr Plus will fall into that same awkward middle child situation.</p><p>Sag says that while this is true to a lesser extent, “the Razr Plus is far more differentiated from the Ultra than the Samsung models are.” Basically, for anyone who still want a flagship-esque experience without paying more than $1,000, this is the phone for you.</p><p>On the other hand, Sag notes that Galaxy Plus phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, are probably a better deal, as they typically utilize the same chipset as their Ultra counterparts, rather than a less powerful version, which allows for price reductions in other areas.</p>
<h2 id="now-it-s-samsung-s-turn-2">Now it’s Samsung’s turn</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-render-closed" alt="A leaked look at a minty green Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE closed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1668" height="938" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sag believes that Motorola’s new Razr 2025 series still offers great value in regions like China, and “especially in the US market where foldable competition is weak.”</p><p>This gives me hope that Motorola may execute this three-product strategy successfully, leveraging its strengths as a company that still knows how to undercut the competition while also proving it can truly compete with the big boys.</p><p>This is something I think Samsung needs to emulate with its foldable phones. Every year, the company launches one large-screened foldable and a smaller flip phone, and both have done well for the company. However, with last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 6 price hike and the expected price increase for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung will need to continue to offer options that are within reach for consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-01" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 and Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We’ve written about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-really-needs-to-build-a-cheap-flip-phone">Samsung needs to launch a Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>, and we may finally get one this year, with Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">rumored</a> to use a less powerful chipset (among other changes) to achieve a cheaper price tag.</p><p>That’s definitely a start, and we would love to see something similar with the Fold series, with an option that costs a few hundred dollars less to help drive adoption. And just like last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-is-what-the-z-fold-6-should-have-been">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, the company could offer some type of ultra-premium model for both Flip and Fold devices for the people who are willing to spend more on the latest and greatest.</p><p>With foldables becoming more mainstream, offering consumers more choices feels like the best option for companies, especially in the U.S., where there are already so few when compared to other regions. So, where Motorola is doing the smart thing by emulating Samsung, Samsung and others need to follow suit and give us more, and not limit us to just one foldable model a year.</p>

The judge presiding over the latest antitrust case hasn't said much about it either way but some politicians seem to think it's the correct way to punish Google for the financial indiscretions it has committed. (<em>Editor's note: are these considered crimes? Let me know what you think in the comments</em>).</p><p>I don't think this is going to happen and my dad always used to tell me it's good to want things. Part of me wants to see Google smacked hard so it stops doing shady stuff, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">smarter part of me</a> knows that there aren't really any companies that could maintain projects like Android or Chrome without being equally, or even more, shady. It's a good thing I'm not in charge of anything.</p>

<p>To make this thing even more of a spectacle, Yahoo! (never forget the !) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/655975/yahoo-search-web-browser-prototype-google-trial-antitrust-chrome" target="_blank">has thrown its hat into the ring </a>and stated that it too would like to "buy" Chrome should Google be forced to sell. I'll give you a moment to remember who Yahoo is and to stop laughing.</p><p>Yahoo has become the quintessential tech failure story. Believe it or not, at one time Yahoo had the power over the web that Google currently has; huge market share, investors and potential partners climbing over each other to grab a bite, and a seemingly endless potential. We saw how that turned out.</p><p>Today Yahoo is a shell of its former self and even the execs at the company are aware of it. One of the big reasons, in its own estimation, is that it lacks any sort of first-party web browser. Well, OK, a real web browser: Yahoo's real owner, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apollo.com/" target="_blank">Apollo Global Management</a>, happens to also own NetScape. You might have heard of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:347px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.42%;"><img id="p4wxh5NxfuxFjRTDDmquJa" name="Netscape" alt="Netscape Browser window at full size in 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4wxh5NxfuxFjRTDDmquJa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="347" height="286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: By User:Ericd, Fair use, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86883" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86883</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I get its reasoning, 100%. You might, too, even if you don't know you get it. It has to do with the way web searches are done.</p><p>You can open up a web browser, go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google.com</a>, and type a search into the box in the center of the screen. Millions of people do just that every hour.</p><p>You can also open up a web browser (most of them, anyway) and just type in your search.</p><p>Both get the same results from the same place, one way just saved you some typing and page loading. Yahoo knows how important this is and is said to be actively developing its own browser anyway. I'd bet money that it will be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-internet-actually-better-android-browser-chrome">Chromium-based browser</a> like most others, too. At least I hope Yahoo doesn't think it can reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Is this good or bad? I'll answer with another question: Can it be both?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apollo Media Group owns a bunch of stuff from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncl.com/" target="_blank">Norwegian Cruise Lines</a> to web/cloud security provider and hosting company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a>. It has the money that would be needed to maintain the Chrome project.</p><p>It would also most likely shape Chrome's future to its own benefit. At least I would expect that to happen should Chrome fall under its umbrella.</p><p>This highlights the real problem corporations that probably shouldn't have so much control over the web, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or Google, are the ones with the financial means to lose money year after year building Chrome and its software ecosystem.</p><p>Companies that should be in charge, like Mozilla or Duck Duck Go, can't afford it. Don't get me started on companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/chatgpt-chief-says-openai-would-buy-chrome-if-google-is-selling">Perplexity or OpenAI having any sort of control</a> over anything more important than a TV remote. It's bad enough seeing Google holding it.</p>
<p>Yahoo needs Chrome but it most certainly doesn't need it to be affiliated with Google.  Google needs Chrome because it likes money, and some people say it uses Chrome to extort even more of it away from the competition. We need Chrome, but we don't need it to be affiliated with <em>any </em>web search platform.</p><p>I have no idea what will happen and as I've said, I don't think an American judge would ever force an American company to sell off an American asset, especially in the current political and financial climate. And yes, I know that America is more than the United States and <strong>you</strong> know what I mean.</p><p>I just thought seeing Yahoo jump into the mix was worth thinking and talking about for at least a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>There's a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr </a>on the block.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 series arrived this week as a trio for the first time. Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini</a> suite as well.</p><p>At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance.</p><p><strong>Razr Ultra:</strong></p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 </a>arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic.</p><p>The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. With its premium specs, the Ultra starts at $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, along with 16GB of RAM.</p><p><strong>Razr Plus: </strong></p><p>Razr's premium model just got demoted to being the middle child. This year's Plus variant comes with almost the same specs as last year. With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink.</p><p>The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </a>chipset, similar to the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch"> Razr Plus 2024. </a>It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera.  The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99.</p>

<p><strong>Razr 2025: </strong></p><p>As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky.</p><p>The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a>, a notch higher than its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">predecessor</a>. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor.</p><p>The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store.</p><p>Along with its clamshells, the company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">launched</a> the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is officially removing Assistant Driving Mode from Android as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> transition. The feature has undergone numerous changes since its introduction in 2019, most recently losing the app dashboard that was a crucial part of the Driving Mode experience. Now, it's no longer available as part of the Google Maps app for Android, the company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/25/google-assistant-driving-mode-maps/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>As of February 2024, the app launcher that featured large, easy-to-touch icons while driving was removed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/assistant-driving-mode-change-coming-soon">most recent version of Assistant Driving Mode</a> only offered a media playback bar and the a control button. It was mostly used by Android users that didn't have a car with Android Auto functionality, since Driving Mode offered similar utility at one point.</p><p>In fact, Assistant Driving Mode was initially seen as a replacement and alternative to Android Auto for Phone Screens, was killed in 2021.</p><p>The Assistant Driving Mode app launcher was one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">many Google Assistant feature removals announced in January 2024</a>. "Using app launcher in Google Assistant driving mode on Google Maps to read and send messages, make calls, and control media," the company explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?visit_id=638405824903310620-1049243567&p=assistant_is_changing&rd=1">support document</a> at the time. "You can still use voice control on Google Maps the same way."</p>

<p>Over a year later, not even the Assistant Driving Mode's playback controls or voice control button are available as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>. This is an intentional removal that is part of the Gemini transition, per the company. At this point, it means Assistant Driving Mode in Maps is gone for good.</p><p>The move is part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">larger transition from Google Assistant to Gemini</a> that was announced officially in March 2025. It's currently underway, and will see most mobile devices ditch Assistant in favor of Gemini in the near future.</p>

The company will offer discounts to affected users that want to upgrade to the 4th-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, it said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Support-changes-to-our-earliest-generation-Nest-Learning-Thermostats/ba-p/713068" target="_blank">community post</a> dated April 25, 2025.</p><p>The decision, which will take effect October 25, 2025, means that the 1st-gen and 2nd-gen Nest Learning Thermostat models will no longer receive software updates or support remote control via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. The hardware will still work as a traditional thermostat, but smart features are going away this fall.</p><p>"We're incredibly excited about the future of Nest and the innovative experiences we're building for your smart home," the company explained. "To fully invest in these advancements and bring you the most cutting-edge features on our latest generation of Nest thermostats, we will be transitioning away from supporting three of our oldest devices, each over a decade old."</p>

<p>"All other Nest thermostat models are unaffected and will continue to receive security updates," Google continues. "Later this year you also will be able to create and adjust schedules for these devices in the Google Home app for the first time."</p><p>Google aims to "ease the transition" by offering U.S. customers $130 off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new 4th-generation Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, bringing the cost down to $149.99 (MSRP $279.99). In Canada, customers get $160 off the new thermostat, which would then cost $219.99 (MSRP $379.99 CAD).</p>

<p>European customers can't buy a new Nest Thermostat, but Google is offering 50% off a third-party thermostat with Google Home Support.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-google-no-longer-selling-nest-learning-thermostats-in-europe-2">Why is Google no longer selling Nest Learning Thermostats in Europe?</h2>
<p>As part of the announcement, Google said it will no longer sell new Nest Learning Thermostat models in Europe. The third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Thermostat E will both continue to be sold in Europe while supplies last. After that, it'll be up to third-party Google Home partners to fill the gap.</p><p>"Heating systems in Europe are unique and have a variety of hardware and software requirements that make it challenging to build for the diverse set of homes," Google said. "Therefore moving forward we’ll no longer launch new Nest thermostats in Europe."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I was a Motorola fanboy. This was back in the day when basically everyone was, as it was in the company's hayday. We had the Moto X and Moto Maker, the Motorola-made Nexus 6 was ahead of its time, at least in screen size, and then all of the fun just went away. For me, Motorola had a brief resurgence with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-z">Moto Z</a> devices, even if the idea of magnetic accessories didn't catch on until Apple did it with MagSafe.</p><p>But then, Motorola just faded into obscurity, focusing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">sub-$300 market</a>, and for the most part, doing a good job at it. By then, Motorola had been purchased by Google, before being stripped down and sold for parts to Lenovo. Since then, I've never even had so much of a peripheral desire to use a Moto phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wsZEcLuivUBdgGL2DEvm4U" name="nexus-6-black-and-white" alt="Motorola Nexus 6 in Black and White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsZEcLuivUBdgGL2DEvm4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And then the company released its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-razr-review">first foldable phone</a>, complete with the ability to make the dial pad look like the old-school RAZR that I used in high school. The needle moved a bit, but after using a couple of clamshell foldables, I decided that the book-style was my preferred design.</p><p>However, given just how long it's been since I've used a Motorola phone, I have to admit that I'm intrigued by what the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra</a> brings to the table. Over the past couple of years, Motorola has beaten Samsung to the punch when it comes to offering a bit of innovation in the space. Mostly, when it comes to the cover screen, it continued to get bigger and simultaneously more useful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing though, it's still just a regular sized phone that folds in half. There's no appeal in that for me, especially since I rarely even leave my house, let alone travel outside the confines of my state. So the idea of being ultra portable and pocketable is lost on me from the get-go.</p><p>Instead, I wish Motorola would have debuted its first book-style foldable phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold are both great in their own rights, and the OnePlus Open still holds up for most tasks. But, the Oppo Find N5 isn't being rebranded, and we don't know when the next OnePlus foldable will even arrive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is so far removed from my mind that it wasn't until now that I thought about where it could release a Galaxy Z Fold competitor. That's with folks like Android Central Managing Editor and Resident Moto Nerd, Derrek Lee, heaping praise on Motorola whenever they can.</p><p>So there are a few reasons why I think Motorola could excel, with the first being the experience it already has. Foldable phones aren't for everyone, and at the same time, they aren't for every company. However, Moto has been in the game since it joined the ranks with Huawei and Samsung back in 2019, longer than Google and OnePlus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-1" alt="Instagram on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3807" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's important, as Motorola has the experience of dealing with varying screen sizes and accounting for foldable states. Granted, they've been confined to the height and width of traditional candy bar phones, but still, that should count for something.</p><p>Another reason why I think a Moto book-style foldable would be neat is that until the Razr Ultra, the company has pretty much managed to stay under the $1,000 price point. The Ultra throws that notion out the window, with its $1,299 price tag, coming in slightly higher than the Z Flip 6 with the same amount of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, with that, you're getting a larger cover screen, a better and less finicky experience on said cover screen, and flagship specs. That includes the Snapdragon 8 Elite, paired with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p><p>Motorola even beats out Samsung in the camera department, relying on dual 50MP sensors, compared to the 50MP + 12MP combination of the Flip. So if you ask me, the Razr Ultra should take the crown for best clamshell foldable, unless Samsung manages to pull a rabbit out of its hat with the Z Flip 7.</p><p>I'd even venture so far as to say that I'm intrigued to the point that I'm actually considering picking one up. For one, it's probably time that I pay more attention to what Motorola is doing, as I can't even remember the last Moto phone that I used. But I'm also interested in trying out the form factor again, seeing as its been a couple of years since I last used a flip phone.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Motorola told us all about the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">2025 Razr</a> phones, and now we can stop guessing what will be there and what won't. The biggest twist was a new expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Ultra model</a> while maybe the real news is the lack of significant changes from 2024 to 2025 on the "regular" Razr and the Razr Plus.</p><p>First off, I do not hate this. Not one tiny bit. When you make a product that you're confident in and sell it at a price you think is fair, there shouldn't be a lot to change year in and year out. A 2025 Razr is simply a 2024 Razr with newer, easier-to-obtain components inside and a vehicle for a new software platform and business partnership.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything can stay the same. You get a new MediaTek processor and camera parts, neither of which will live up to any promises or make any difference in day-to-day use because they never do, and the big thing for the software is a partnership with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity AI</a> to make it able to be the default agent on your phone.</p><p>Nothing to sneeze at for sure, but nothing worth rushing out to upgrade if you have last year's model. The saving grace is the price; it's a new foldable that should work well under $700. Again, just like last year's model.</p>

<p>Don't buy one for $699 unless you just gotta have it today, though. I think the secret weapon feature is going to stay the same — that price was meant to change and there is either plenty of profit margin in this one or it's being used as a loss leader. I predict you'll soon be able to buy it for a song and dance.</p><p>That's what happened last year. The Razr is a good buy at $699 compared to the price of other phones. It's an even better buy at $599 or $499, but it's a crazy bargain at $299. And a $299 Moto Razr, even an unlocked model, was not hard to find.</p>
<p>I have no plans to run out and get a new phone because that's something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-havent-switched-phones-for-almost-a-year-and-i-love-it">I hate doing</a> and I don't need one right now. If I were looking for one, the Razr is the one I would be looking at. Not only because it's what I know and like using every day, but because it's a great value.</p><p>When people say Moto messed up by not making the 2025 Razr different from last year, I disagree and think the company did just what it should have done: same great phone, same great price, and hopefully, the same deals to come.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out its newest tile redesign in Meet, which we've heard previously.</li><li>The redesign will sample colors from a user's profile picture when their camera is not in use, creating a classier, modern take on the old bland gray background.</li><li>This "color-sampling" feature was highlighted during Google Meet's large update announcement in late March alongside "Dynamic Layouts."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to have a slight design revamp rolling out for its video calling experience on desktop.</p><p>The redesign in Meet was spotted for its tiles by Android Central's Editor-in-Chief (EIC), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/shruti-shekar">Shruti Shekar</a>, earlier today (Apr. 25). According to her discovery, this particular tile revamp only concerns users who aren't using their camera. Previously, this would default your tile to a gray background with your circular profile icon in its center.</p><p>However, today's update brings a little more pizazz.</p><p>We've observed a more appealing, vibrant coloring behind our profile icons when in a Meet call. While the coloring may seem random, it's actually taking colors from our Google account pictures to produce a classier appearance. For our EIC, it sampled the brown brick coloring of her background.</p><p>Android Central's News Editor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nandika-ravi">Nandika Ravi</a>, had a bluish coloring in her portrait's background sampled and implanted onto the tile. Another interesting change is that the user's profile icon is taken and blown up in the background of the colored tile. It's then blurred to complete the more modern take on an otherwise bland gray history.</p><p>You can take a look at Meet's before and after photos. While we've noticed this today, our EIC states the change was only seen on her Mac laptop. Perhaps this is rolling out for iOS desktops to start before Windows PCs receive it — keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Google's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">slowly rolling out updates</a> for Meet that improve the experience significantly. In August 2024, the company brought upgraded on-the-go calling for users who are, for example, driving. The feature arrived for Android and iOS devices, bringing enlarged buttons and an audio-only mode to ensure you're not distracted (but still paying attention).</p><p>On a more fun side, Meet gained "stacked" effects. Users can add unique "accessories" to their video stream during a call, like characters, costumes, and more.</p><p>Regarding the new tiles in Meet, that was wrapped in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-now-uses-ai-to-show-more-faces-in-dynamic-layouts">another large update</a> from late March. In its Workspace post, Google said the "visual upgrade" would bring "color-sampled tile theming for users with their cameras off." We're not seeing to what extent this color sampling function will go for users and their diverse profile pictures. Additionally, the update leaned heavily on AI with "Dynamic Layouts."</p><p>These layouts will crop out useless background space in your video stream to prioritize your face and the faces of others.</p>

The company's CEO and Co-Founder, Adrian Li Mow Ching, stated, "Clicks for Razr has quickly become the most popular physical keyboard for Android smartphones."</p><p>As such, the post says the newly announced physical keyboard attachment for the Razr Ultra 2025 "builds on the hype" the company experienced when it launched the Razr/Razr Plus 2024 version.</p><p>Users interested will be able to pre-order the Clicks keyboard and case combination. You can quickly slot the Razr Ultra into the case and use its keyboard on its cover display, or open it and use it in a more practical scenario. Clicks says its designed its back-lit keys are designed to be "ergonomic" and "contoured," meaning consumers should have a comfortable typing experience.</p><p>Moreover, as if it were a full-fledged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">keyboard for a tablet</a>, Clicks says there are shortcuts available to launch apps and more without tapping your display.</p>

<p>The Clicks keyboard for the Razr Ultra 2025 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discover.clicks.tech/products/clicks-keyboard-for-motorola-razr-2025">available for pre-orders</a> beginning today (Apr. 25). Consumers will find the product in Onyx, which the post states is an "off-black," for $139. Keep in mind that Android Central has tried accessing the page, but it doesn't appear to be working properly at the time of writing. However, the case/keyboard combo isn't prepared to ship until <em>after </em>May 31.</p><p>You might benefit from checking again later on to see if it's up and running.</p><p>If you remember BlackBerry, the Clicks keyboard for the Moto Razr <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">kind of brought that back</a>. The product gives users a new (old?) way to utilize their phones, especially if they miss the feeling of a physical keyboard on a mobile device. Moreover, Clicks' keyboard lets Razr and Razr Plus 2024 users unlock a brand new experience with their cover displays.</p><p>Adrian Li Mow Ching added the case and the phone work together to create a "pocketable productivity pairing" for consumers.</p><p>Last year's Razrs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">weren't the only ones</a> Clicks brought into the physical keypad fold. The company looped in the Google Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Galaxy S25.</p>

<ul><li>CMF by Nothing has continued to tease its upcoming Phone 2 Pro; however, its latest post might allude to a unique camera add-on.</li><li>The sub-brand posted what appears to be a camera lens attachment, but offers no additional information, leaving only speculation.</li><li>CMF by Nothing's latest teasers showed off the Phone 2 Pro in two-toned orange and white colors, as well as confirmation of "Essential Spaces."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We're on the cusp of the next CMF by Nothing reveal, but the company just teased something that might shake up your next trip.</p><p>The sub-brand has been teasing its upcoming products all week on X, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1915707413123993949">its latest one</a> seemingly teasing a camera addition. CMF by Nothing's post is short, only offering the tagline: "3 days until we announce..." What's most important is the image, which shows what we, and many others on X, believe to be a camera lens attachment.</p><p>The company hasn't clearly stated what this is and, if it is a lens attachment, what its specifications could be. CMF by Nothing has been hyping up its camera, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1913155928951505011">a previous teaser</a> said, "Built for light, depth, and detail. Redesigned from the inside out." This teaser regarded the CMF Phone 2 Pro.</p><p>There's a chance this lens attachment (should it be true) will help consumers take more detailed shots with enhanced zoom, aperture, and other additions.</p><p>The CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro is slated to debut on April 28.</p>

<p>CMF <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-its-cmf-phone-2-pro-days-before-launch">posted a clearer look</a> at its Phone 2 Pro earlier this week. The short clip showed off the device in two colors: orange and white. The device looks to sport a two-tone design, with the top half adopting a brighter, vibrant look. The next CMF Phone keeps its screws and other "modularity" aspects, which was confirmed in a recently highlighted post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AkisEvangelidis/status/1915706006610288746">Akis Evangelidis</a>.</p><p>Another key aspect of the CMF Phone 2 Pro is its <em>triple </em>camera array. Right now, rumors allege the device's array will contain a 50MP 1/1.57-inch primary lens, a 50MP 2x telephoto camera, and an 8MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The device is also expected to debut with Nothing's new suite of AI features under its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a>" moniker. This collection of AI software debuted first on the Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Phone 3a and 3a Pro, </a>giving users tools to capture on-screen content and store it away for later. The AI contains its own organizational tools, so users can easily find what they've taken previously.</p><p>The sub-brand also released its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-cmf-buds-2-are-now-available-as-it-teases-the-cmf-phone-2-pro">CMF Buds 2</a> in mid-April, a few weeks ahead of its next major phone launch.</p>

<p>So far, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Google Pixel 9a promos</a> have been requiring things like trade-ins and new wireless lines to receive the savings, so it's nice to see a straightforward phone deal come down the pipeline. </p><p>No matter which offer you choose, however, you'll be getting a midrange beauty with a vibrant 6.3-inch pOLED display, the super-efficient Tensor G4 chipset, and a larger battery than the more-expensive Google Pixel 9. Google will also hook you up with seven years of OS/security upgrades and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> straight out of the box. </p><p>If you can afford it, the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> is obviously the better device, but for folks who are looking for modern Pixel technology in a budget phone package, this Best Buy deal presents a unique opportunity.</p>

<p>Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/homeworld-vast-reaches-arrives-on-meta-quest">Meta’s Quest VR </a>headsets.</p><p>In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added.</p>

<p>Reuters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/meta-cuts-jobs-its-reality-labs-division-2025-04-24/">noted</a> that employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, are among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well.</p><p>They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."</p><p>As of December last year, the company's headcount <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx">grew</a> by 10%, to 74,067. This comes after Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that he would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-reports-upbeat-quarterly-revenue-2025-01-29/">cut</a> 5% of Meta's lowest-performing employees and warned them that more cuts were slated for this year.</p>

<p>During Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Q4 earnings call </a>in January,  the company stated that Reality Labs experienced a record-breaking revenue in 2024. This was driven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> sales, with Zuckerberg commenting that "the number of people using Quest and Horizon is steadily growing." He further described 2025 as a "pivotal year for the metaverse" and teased the company launching more "visually stunning content" soon.</p><p>However, it is important to note that despite its great overall performance, the Reality Labs division operated at a loss in Q4, with operating expenses totaling nearly $5 billion.</p><p>In other news, Meta is slated to announce its Q1 earnings for this year on April 30, which could give us more insight as to what Reality Labs' revenue looks like for this quarter.</p>

But I also found new settings to change based on my preferences, plus some tips from Google's reviewer guide on new features to test.</p><p>From basic settings to Gemini tricks, these are the first nine things to do with your Google Pixel 9a after unboxing it!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-your-display-settings"><span>Update your display settings</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RKXEX5735XkJttz5XJ2hMh" name="Google-Pixel-9a-settings" alt="The display size settings menu on the Google Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKXEX5735XkJttz5XJ2hMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the first things I did with my Pixel 9a was go to <strong>Settings > Display & touch</strong>, lengthen the <strong>screen timeout</strong> from the default 30 seconds to two minutes, and toggle the <strong>smooth display</strong> option to unlock 120Hz for certain apps. The Pixel 9a has the battery life to handle the extra power draw for better visuals, and I like that I can set my phone down for a minute and then pick right back up without a login delay.</p><p>Many of my colleagues dislike adaptive brightness on any phone, preferring to adjust it themselves in the Quick Settings. If you agree, you can <strong>untoggle Adaptive brightness</strong> in this same Display & touch menu. Then you can <strong>swipe down twice</strong> from the home screen to find the brightness slider anytime.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="frtqi8nGB6g6fx2ofAJ5b7" name="pixel-9a-display-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to lengthen the screen timeout or turn on the Dark or Night Light themes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/frtqi8nGB6g6fx2ofAJ5b7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, you can choose between the popular <strong>Dark theme</strong> or the <strong>Night Light</strong> setting with an amber hue that prevents blue light. In either case, if you only want to use it at night, tap the text to find a <strong>Schedule</strong> option for bedtime, sunset to sunrise, or a custom time. You can also adjust the amber intensity of Night Light.</p><p>Another way to prevent eye strain is with the <strong>Display size and text</strong> settings under Appearance; here, you can make the UI font bigger, make the font <strong>bold</strong> or <strong>high contrast</strong>, or make <em>everything</em> bigger like icons.</p><p>Finally, open the <strong>Lock screen</strong> settings and toggle "Always show time and info" for a basic always-on display (AOD) that also includes the weather, notification icons, and battery percentage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QZ53m5TwsxP9UhvA9JaFcg" name="Google-Pixel-9a-charging-optimization-settings" alt="The Charging optimization settings menu on the Google Pixel 9a held next to a charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZ53m5TwsxP9UhvA9JaFcg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the Pixel 9a uses charging optimization, studying your sleep and charging patterns so that it hits 100% around the time you usually wake up. This prolongs your battery life but can also lead to moments where it's not fully charged if you wake up early.</p><p>In the Settings app, tap <strong>Battery > Charging optimization</strong> to toggle off Adaptive Charging, if you prefer. Then you can go into <strong>Battery Saver</strong> options and toggle off <strong>Use Adaptive battery</strong>, which can "reduce performance and delay notifications" based on your usage habits to "extend battery life." Your 9a will be faster, but may need a battery replacement down the line.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iucUdxH5auGWNzNZEJwBd7" name="Google-Pixel-9a-charging-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to turn on or off Charging optimization, schedule Battery Saver mode, and turn off Adaptive Battery mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iucUdxH5auGWNzNZEJwBd7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Conversely, you can permanently <strong>Limit charging to 80%</strong> in the optimization menu. Because the Pixel 9a has enough battery to last a full day with plenty left over, this option ensures the best possible battery longevity, but could lead to a shortage if you spend all day taking photos or gaming.</p><p>If you're trying to extend your Pixel 9a to two-day use, one thing to consider is tapping <strong>Battery > Battery Saver > Schedule</strong> and increasing the percentage where it toggles on to, say, 30% or 40%.</p>

<p>If you don't already have your <strong>Bedtime routine settings</strong> ported from your last Pixel, go to <strong>Settings > Digital Wellbeing > Bedtime mode</strong> and toggle open <strong>Bedtime routine</strong> to change which hours and days it toggles.</p><p>You can also make it so Bedtime mode auto-activates when you charge your Pixel 9a or turns off when your first alarm goes off. And under <strong>Customize > Screen options</strong>, you can trigger specific Bedtime changes like turning off AOD or dimming the wallpaper at night.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WUguprPDHcddpJ7J5WLMb7" name="Google-Pixel-9a-bedtime-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing the Settings for Bedtime Mode, Focus Mode, and App Limits." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WUguprPDHcddpJ7J5WLMb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Bedtime isn't the only mode you should consider if you have a problem with endless doomscrolling or Instagram/TikTok feeds at night. Tap <strong>App limits</strong> to set a hard time limit to any specific app or turn on <strong>Screen time reminders</strong> for "gentle reminders when you're spending a long time in an app."</p><p>You may also want to use <strong>Focus mode</strong> to limit distracting notifications during work hours. First, choose "distracting apps" with notifications you'd like to hide, then tap <strong>set a schedule</strong> to choose when you'd like to filter them out. Alternatively, a Focus mode toggle should appear in the Quick Settings if you want to trigger it manually.</p><p>My personal favorite? <strong>Flip to Shhh</strong>, which toggles on Do Not Disturb if you put your phone face-down on a flat surface, such as during a meeting; toggle it on if that sounds useful!</p>

<p>Your Pixel 9a comes with a few free Google goodies. You only get <strong>three months of YouTube Premium</strong> if you haven't gotten a free trial before, but even returning customers will get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium</strong> so long as you're not currently subscribed; simply open the Fitbit app to accept the offer, and set a reminder to cancel in six months if you don't end up liking it.</p><p>Unfortunately, only the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro get free trials of Google One or Google One AI Premium, respectively. But at least the Pixel 9a gets free access to the <strong>VPN by Google</strong>, a former Google One perk that's now Pixel-exclusive. This lets you have secure mobile browsing on both public and private networks, even if it's not as robust as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">favorite (paid) VPNs</a>.</p><p>To turn on the VPN, go to <strong>Settings > Network & Internet > VPN by Google</strong> and tap the <strong>Allow</strong> option at the bottom. You can then choose to <strong>Pause VPN on selected networks</strong> (such as your personal network) since it may use more data than normal browsing. You can also toggle the VPN on and off in the Quick Settings menu by swiping down from the Home screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-scam-detection-screening"><span>Scam detection & screening</span></h2>
<p>The Google Phone app has a ton of AI-backed smarts that you'll want to turn on straight away. Open the app, tap the <strong>top-right ellipsis</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong>. Caller ID & spam should be on by default — though check it to be sure — while other useful tricks need to be toggled on.</p><p>Spam calls are identified, but if you want to fully screen them, tap <strong>Call Screen</strong> and toggle <strong>Automatically screen calls</strong> to filter first-time callers, Spam numbers, and possibly faked numbers. A pop-up like "Screening unknown number" will appear, which you can tap to see a real-time transcript of Assistant speaking to the (alleged) person. If Assistant thinks the person is real, they'll send the call over to you.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-features"><span>Set up emergency features</span></h2>
<p>If you're like me, you'll procrastinate on setting up emergency Pixel 9a features until you "have time" and then never do it. Rip off the band-aid and spend the next five minutes making sure these features are all set up!</p><p>In <strong>Settings > Safety & emergency</strong>, turn on Emergency SOS so that either pressing the Power button five times pulls up the emergency menu, so it'll auto-call <strong>911</strong> and (if you toggle these features) <strong>share info with emergency contacts</strong> and <strong>record emergency video</strong> of whatever's happening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WbapdbhebPFhb8JL2K98Nd" name="google-pixel-9a-emergency-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to turn on Emergency SOS and Emergency Sharing, as well as add your Medical information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WbapdbhebPFhb8JL2K98Nd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, add your <strong>Medical information</strong> like your blood type, allergies, medication, medical notes, and whether you're an organ donor to be shared with emergency responders. Then go ahead and <strong>add emergency contacts</strong> like family or roommates that you'd like notified in these moments.</p><p><strong>Car crash detection</strong> may be enabled by default, but tap it to toggle on <strong>Emergency Sharing</strong> of your location and status to your contacts. And while you're in this menu, you can toggle <strong>Silence notifications while driving</strong>, which uses your device's "motion and Bluetooth connections to figure out when you're in a moving vehicle" — though this won't work if you regularly take a bus or subway.</p>

<p>If you haven't used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> yet, you're missing out. On any photo, tap <strong>Edit</strong>, then the <strong>rainbow icon</strong> in the bottom-left. You can tap an object or person to resize it or move it around the frame; personally, I like to tap the bottom-middle <strong>magic wand icon</strong> that pulls up options like Auto reframing, reimagined backgrounds, stylized filters, alternative water layers, shifted Portrait blurring, and other contextually relevant changes.</p><p>Of course, Magic Editor is old news for Pixel 8a users, as is Magic Eraser, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a>, and other AI tools; those linked guides will help if you're new to Pixels.</p><p>But in terms of what's new to the Pixel A-series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9"><strong>Add Me</strong></a> is a useful trick that lets everyone into a group photo, including the one taking it.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-camera-macro-focus" alt="The Google Pixel 9a camera viewfinder, with a close-up of a gnome thanks to the Macro Focus mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Macro Focus</strong> is even easier to use! If you get your 9a close enough (within 5cm or 2 inches), a flower icon will appear in the top-right corner and the viewfinder should auto-adjust to put the entire subject into clear focus. There's no extra settings required.</p><p>The third new feature is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel"><strong>Astrophotography mode</strong></a>, with which you set your Pixel 9a up somewhere stable — ideally with a tripod — and take a drawn-out shot of the night sky. To use it, swipe to the <strong>Night Sight</strong> option next to Photo, tap the <strong>moon icon</strong> in the bottom-right, and then push the slider that appears from Auto to <strong>Astro</strong>. Once your phone is stable, tap the <strong>5-second countdown button</strong> and the 9a will take a four-minute shot of your subject!</p>

<p>I tend to use the default wallpaper on my phones for years, something that my partner frequently mocks me for. If you want to let your personality fly, <strong>tap and hold</strong> any empty space on the home screen, then tap <strong>Wallpaper & style > More wallpapers</strong>.</p><p>Google has hundreds of curated wallpapers available in categories like Motif, Living Universe, Landscapes, and some European football teams for some reason. To get more personal, tap <strong>My photos</strong> and choose a favorite family pic or some cool art you downloaded from online. Or, you can try your luck with the <strong>AI wallpaper prompt</strong>, choose a theme like "Painting" or "Imaginary," and then change the prompt words until you find something less creepy than the teddy bear watercolor Google came up with.</p><p>As a side note, if you're a fan of AI art prompts for inspiration, be sure to install the <strong>Pixel Studio app</strong> that creates general-purpose art, not just wallpapers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E7PKYutSdDgzmCNGxbLWrg" name="Google-Pixel-9a-widgets" alt="Gmail, Chrome, and Photos widgets on the Google Pixel 9a sitting on a brick surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E7PKYutSdDgzmCNGxbLWrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you've finished sprucing up your home and lock screen wallpaper, I highly recommend adding <strong>widgets</strong> by (again) tapping and holding the home screen and tapping that menu option.</p><p>I mostly use the vertical app drawer to find apps I want, so the secondary home screens full of apps are wasted space for me! So I instead fill that space with widgets that let me preview the information I'm most likely to need, like my upcoming Google Calendar reminder, today's weather, music playback controls, or most recent Gmail emails.</p><p>Widgets can also be sources of fun, like the "Your memories" box from Google Photos, the Chrome Dino game, or a Strava widget showing my weekly mileage. To add them, simply tap and hold any widget and then drag them onto your home screen!</p>

<p>Gemini has become the default assistant for Android.

Either way, this lets you ask Gemini about what's on your screen, like summarizing a YouTube video or...this article, if you wanted!</p><p>Otherwise, you'll get the best Gemini responses by opening the Gemini app. There, you can type out questions or tap the <strong>Gemini Live icon</strong> in the bottom-right for an in-depth conversation that remembers past questions for context. You can even upload images and ask Gemini about them, or use your Pixel 9a camera to ask for information about the world around you.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this Google Pixel 9a beginner's guide has given you the tips and tricks necessary to take full advantage of your new phone!</p><p>My last bit of advice is something that applies to most new phone purchases, but especially the Pixel 9a: Make sure you buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">Pixel 9a case</a> and/ or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">Pixel 9a screen protector</a>! The 9a isn't as wide as some flagship phones, and its thick sides aren't hard to grip, but all it takes is one drop to ruin that camera sensor or crack through the outdated Gorilla Glass 3 display protection.</p><p>Otherwise, if you're curious how else the Pixel 9a compares to its predecessor, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a camera review</a> or our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a vs. 8a feature guide</a>!</p>

This plays on Motorola's strengths in the market and ushers in a new chance for the company to break into the premium segment once again, something it hasn't tried since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025 family</a> continues to improve the specs, ingress protection, durability, and even offers more variety than ever before. Because of this, we have some ideas of what to expect from Motorola in 2026 when it launches the inevitable Motorola Razr 2026 line.</p><p>Here, we'll be compiling all the rumors, leaks, and what we expect to see from Motorola's successful flippable foldables in the coming year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-2026-what-s-likely-to-be-the-same"><span>Motorola Razr 2026: What's likely to be the same</span></h3>

<p>Unless the Motorola Razr Ultra 2026 is a complete failure, we fully expect Motorola to continue offering multiple models at different price points. Motorola has shied away from making a full-on premium phone for the U.S. market for a few years now, and it's good to see them return with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Razr 2025 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Motorola has also been expanding its repertoire of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">alternative materials on phones</a>, particularly on the Razr line, and we fully expect to see that make a comeback in 2026. If Motorola can offer vegan leather on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">phones that are less than $200</a>, there's no reason to expect the company to return to breakable glass on its foldable line.</p><p>We also don't expect Motorola to stray from the "flip" form factor any time soon. While Motorola continually experiments with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rizr-rollable-phone-updated-fingerprint-patent">different smartphone form factors</a>, it's pretty clear it thinks that phones are best in a vertical form factor rather than expanding to look like a tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there should be a chip upgrade in next year's Motorola Razr Plus 2026, don't expect the company to bring it up to "proper" flagship levels like it did with the Ultra. If there's any kind of upgrade in the middle model, we expect Motorola to pull a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> and use the previous year's flagship processor as a means of keeping the price low.</p><p>Motorola also already offers significantly faster charging than its biggest rival, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, which means we expect 68W Motorola TurboPower to continue to be offered.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, Motorola isn't just using specs to differentiate the Ultra from the rest of the Razr 2025 lineup. It's also packing the Ultra with more AI features than the other two models, but I don't think that's going to be the case in 2026. If Nothing's budget CMF Phone 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-its-cmf-phone-2-pro-days-before-launch">can have a dedicated AI key</a>, so can the more budget-friendly Razr 2026 phones.</p><p>Likewise, we expect some of the spec upgrades on the Ultra to trickle down to the rest of the line. This could include different materials, like wood or proper leather, as well as processor upgrades, bigger batteries, and even more enhancements to the IP dust and resistance ratings.</p><p>We're also expecting some bigger spec bumps for the Razr Plus 2026 versus what we saw on the 2025 model. As Derrek Lee said in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 hands-on</a>, "Aside from the new hinge, IP48 certification, and Pantone-validated display and cameras, the core specs (of the Razr Plus 2025) are largely the same as those of the Razr Plus 2024." In other words, there's little reason to upgrade if you've got a Razr Plus 2024, but that should change in 2026.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, we're hoping the Razr Ultra 2026 feels just one more "ultra" feature than this year's: a third camera on the back. Motorola already out-specced Samsung in this department, offering the first 50MP triple-camera system on a flip phone, but we think the company can push it a little further and include a 50MP triple-camera system <em>on the back</em>.</p><p>That would give the Ultra the best cameras from the entire rest of the lineup, as the Ultra features a standard and <em>ultrawide </em>lens, while the Razr Plus features a standard and <em>telephoto</em> lens. Having both an ultrawide and a telephoto lens would truly make the Razr Ultra 2026 feel like a massive upgrade.</p><p>And if we're talking wishlist items, any additional customization is always welcome. Motorola set the bar for customization over a decade ago <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">with the Moto X</a> and, given the climate in the U.S. surrounding manufacturing, it would be incredible to see Motorola once again offer the Moto Maker tool so people can fully customize their Razrs in the future.</p>

<p>Last year, Motorola released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr 2024 line</a> in June, while this year's line bumped that up to May 15. We saw something similar happen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, but we don't expect Motorola to continue to move it up every single year.</p><p>The company has often released phones in the April/May timeline, and with the continuing shift in the company's flagship release strategy, it's no surprise seeing the successful Razr take over the Edge's release window. That being said, we expect a Razr 2026 announcement in April 2026 unless something big changes.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Remember a few weeks ago, when I said that I was worried about the slow and painful demise of ChromeOS? Yeah, let's just pretend that never happened. Since then, we've seen new Chromebooks from both Acer and ASUS, and there's more on the way.</p><p>Robby over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/finally-snapdragon-x-plus-chromebooks-are-on-the-way/">ChromeUnboxed</a> is a master when it comes to digging through the Chromium Repositories. The latest discovery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge/+/6483287">was a commit</a> that brings "initial support for Qualcomm X1P42100 SoC," which is just the codename for the Snapdragon X Plus chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TZ2dfXBuPkxHWjxUK9hZZN" name="chromeos-snapdragon-x-plus-its-happening-meme" alt=""It's Happening" meme from 'The Office' using the Chrome and Snapdragon X Plus logos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZ2dfXBuPkxHWjxUK9hZZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4110" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NBCUniversal | Google | Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I get too ahead of myself, this isn't confirmation that such a Chromebook will ever actually see the light of day. We've seen it countless times where a device almost makes it to the finish line, only to fall just short and basically disappear. However, I'm really (and I mean REALLY) hoping that isn't the case here.</p><p>The commit message doesn't really say anything else, so there's no indication of what a ChromeOS Snapdragon X Plus device looks like. All we really know and care about, for the moment, is that the work and development are underway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.34%;"><img id="9bAJdaYSeb8PNUHMrZZvRN" name="snapdragon-x-plus-chromium-gerrit-commit-message" alt="Commit message of Google beginning support development for Snapdragon X Plus SoC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bAJdaYSeb8PNUHMrZZvRN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1160" height="468" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chromium Gerrit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not like this is the first time we're seeing a new ARM chip make its way to the platform. Recently, MediaTek announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/mediatek-is-doing-what-qualcomm-shouldve-done">Kompanio Ultra processor</a>, specifically geared towards the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. It offers almost 20% faster CPU performance, while consuming "up to 50% less power" than the competition. As a result, MediaTek claims it's able to offer up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p><p>This is what makes the idea of an ARM-powered Chromebook so intriguing: a device that is as powerful as its Windows counterparts, with a battery that lasts all day. Plus, these ARM-powered laptops are much smaller and lighter than "traditional" offerings, making them ideal for school and travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7Kewdnugz2BGBDdun2LicX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-9" alt="Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid next to Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Kewdnugz2BGBDdun2LicX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Up to this point, we've been seeing MediaTek inch more and more into the Chromebook space, with a smattering of Intel, and the occasional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-zoom-calls">Snapdragon 7c</a> from Qualcomm. Notably, the Lenovo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Chromebook Duet 11</a> is powered by the Kompanio 828 and performs admirably, but the truth is that it could be better.</p><p>Provided that Google doesn't end up changing its mind, we could eventually have the ChromeOS equivalent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a> or Surface Laptop 7. And hey, here's an idea: Google should dust off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook 2</a> it shelved back in 2022, and release it with the Snapdragon X Plus at the helm.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="42gv2h4vb7yJAffMg8vdyB" name="pixelbook-go-vs-pixelbook-2.jpg" alt="Pixelbook Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42gv2h4vb7yJAffMg8vdyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the sake of not diving down that rabbit hole again, there are a couple of other factors to consider. First, we might not actually ever see a mass-produced Snapdragon X Plus Chromebook released. It's entirely possible that Google is using the X Plus as a development base, in anticipation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/news/welcome-to-the-future-with-snapdragon-x-unveiled-at-ces-2025-">Snapdragon X chip</a> that Qualcomm announced at CES 2025.</p><p>Why would this be the case? Money. You can't find a Snapdragon X Plus device for less than $700, at least without scouring through the second-hand market. Google and its partners have also shied away from releasing Chromebooks that cost more than $700, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 hovering right around there.</p><p>So, before you get too excited, temper your expectations because I don't think we're going to see a Snapdragon X Elite Chromebook. However, utilizing the Snapdragon X Plus lets Google work out any potential kinks with the platform before it makes its way into any devices.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The best camera phone</strong></em></p><p>There's no question that the Find X8 Ultra is an imaging beast. The phone has one of the best camera packages around, and the 1-inch main sensor takes truly outstanding photos and videos in challenging scenarios. The trio of 50MP auxiliary cameras are among the best you'll get on any phone, and you get plenty of versatility. The hardware is on par with the best 2025 phones, you get IP69 ingress protection, and the massive 6100mAh battery lasts at least a day and a half. My biggest issue with the Find X8 Ultra is that it's only on sale in China — OPPO still isn't launching the device globally, and that's a real shame. </p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Outmatched</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a good phone, but it just doesn't deliver much in the way of upgrades. You can pick up last year's S24 Ultra and have a phone that's nearly the same, and Samsung didn't do enough to differentiate its marquee product this year. The deficiencies are exacerbated when pitting the S25 Ultra against the Find X8 Ultra; the latter has a much better AMOLED panel with DC dimming as standard, same internals, better battery life, and better battery life. But it's around the cameras where you'll see the real difference, with the Find X8 Ultra delivering much better photos and videos in just about any situation. It's a good thing, then (at least from Samsung's point of view) that the phone isn't launching in global markets. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ADfct9XkxrELALibYe8i7F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ADfct9XkxrELALibYe8i7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern phone design has coalesced into a sea of similar-looking flat-sided devices, and that's true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> as well. That said, the Find X8 Ultra has some differentiation thanks to the massive camera island at the back. The camera housing definitely dominates attention, and as it's centered, it doesn't lead to any wobble when using the phone on a table. <br><br>Although the device looks distinctive, it doesn't quite have the same elegance of its predecessors. I still prefer the dual-tone design of last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and the leather back combined with the glass insert around the camera housing gave it much better flair.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jEodEMbfBb8GAunnh93F5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jEodEMbfBb8GAunnh93F5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the Find X8 Ultra looks better than the S25 Ultra, with Samsung once again using the same design aesthetic as the last four years. The phone has a flatter profile this year, but other than that, there isn't much in the way of visual changes. While Samsung pioneered ingress protection on phones, the S25 Ultra misses out on IP69; the phone has the usual IP68 dust and water resistance. The Find X8 Ultra gets both IP68 and IP69, allowing it to be immune to pressurized jets of water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X8 Ultra is thicker and heavier than the S25 Ultra but the difference isn't noticeable in daily use, and the upside is that you get a massive battery boost; Samsung still used a 5000mAh battery on its phone, while the Find X8 Ultra gets a 6100mAh unit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a better in-hand feel with the Find X8 Ultra, and there are two dedicated buttons on the device; the alert slider is now a button, and it is similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. The button is heavily customizable, and it allows you to toggle the flashlight, launch the camera, trigger DND, and so on. The other button is on the right, and it acts as a camera shutter. <br><br>While I didn't see much use out of the camera shutter key, the action button is quite decent. On the whole, the Find X8 Ultra has the better design and in-hand feel, and even though it doesn't look quite as distinctive, it outshines what Samsung is selling.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t36NmJtU5brhoGi2GnLGBF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t36NmJtU5brhoGi2GnLGBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED panel, and it nails the basics; it has 120Hz refresh, great colors, and good brightness levels. But Samsung doesn't have any meaningful eye care protection, and the phone misses out on PWM dimming. So if you're sensitive to DC dimming, you will get headaches with extended use of the device. <br><br>Thankfully, Chinese brands are doing a much better job in this area, and the Find X8 Ultra gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels. This is a big deal, and it genuinely makes a difference in daily use. The panel also gets brighter, has outstanding colors, and has ultra-thin bezels. <br><br>Both devices get stereo sound, but I found the X8 Ultra to be louder in general use. They both do a great job with gaming as well, and there are no issues in this regard.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6PjoEAxtyVLuuBzSnbY8AF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PjoEAxtyVLuuBzSnbY8AF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there's one area where both devices are evenly matched, it's the hardware. Both phones use the same Qualcomm silicon, and they have outstanding potential. There isn't any lag or slowdown as such, and while overheating is an issue, it isn't a huge problem unless you're gaming. <br><br>Outside of that, there isn't much that's different. I prefer the ultrasonic reader on the Find X8 Ultra as it's demonstrably faster than the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and it has better accuracy.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage with the Find X8 Ultra is that it has a 6100mAh battery, delivering easily a day and a half between charges. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is decent enough as well thanks to the 5000mAh battery, but it doesn't last as long. The Find X8 Ultra uses silicon battery tech to good effect, and with 100W charging, it takes less than half as long to charge as the S25 Ultra — Samsung just doesn't measure up when it comes to battery and charging tech.</p>

<p>There's no doubt that the Find X8 Ultra has a better camera package than the Galaxy S25 Ultra — OPPO once again managed to deliver a fabulous quartet of 50MP cameras at the back. The main camera uses a 1-inch module, and it is easily one of the best you'll find on any phone today. But it's the rest of the sensors that make the device stand out so much; thanks to dual tele lenses and a good wide-angle module, the phone has better versatility than just about any other Android device I tested in 2025.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't quite measure up when it comes to the cameras. It's still got a great overall package and takes detailed shots and videos, but you don't get the same caliber of photos. Samsung needs to do a better job tuning its devices if it wants to challenge its Chinese rivals, because right now, it just isn't doing enough.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only reason I can't recommend the Find X8 Ultra as enthusiastically is because of its availability. The device is limited to China, and as such, it doesn't include Google's mobile services out of the box. That said, the Play Store APK is included with the package, and it was straightforward to install it and access all the other Google services. <br><br>But because they're not seen as system utilities, there are inconsistencies when using the device. However, the Chinese version of ColorOS 15 has good optimization, and it holds up incredibly well in daily use. I didn't have issues with Google Pay or navigation, but it isn't quite as easy to use as the global flavor of the skin. <br><br>Samsung has the definite edge with the software; the Galaxy S25 Ultra runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> out of the box, and you get the full slate of Galaxy AI features as standard. The interface is familiar, and it runs well on the device. Best of all, you get seven Android OS updates, with the S25 Ultra carving out a lead in this regard.</p>

<p>Out of these two devices, the Find X8 Ultra is the obvious winner. It has a better design, better AMOLED panel, better battery life, and better charging tech. The cameras run rings around the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and there's no doubt that the Find X8 Ultra is the device to get if you need a fantastic overall camera package. <br><br>That's what makes its limited availability so annoying; you'll need to go the reseller route to get the device outside China, and it ends up costing the same as the S25 Ultra as a result — which isn't the case if you buy the device in China. I wouldn't suggest getting the S25 Ultra unless there's a good trade-in deal, because it just doesn't make sense to shell out anything close to retail for this device.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/happy-birthday-youtube-20/">YouTube turned 20</a> this week and celebrating its two decade milestone, the streaming platform shared some fun facts about its inception along with latest features that are being testing and coming to users soon.</p><p>What began as a 19-second video back in 2005 has now evolved into a full-blown streaming giant, with over 20 million video uploads each day. YouTube has also become a hub for people to have conversations and comment, and react to all sorts of videos, whether they like it or not. According to the streaming platform, "in 2024, YouTube users averaged over 100 million comments on videos daily. And we discovered that last year, creators received comments from an average of 10 million viewers every day.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cMcEB3VWKLDjtewfe6366Y" name="ask-gemini-about-video-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Ask Gemini about YouTube video on Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMcEB3VWKLDjtewfe6366Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, YouTube seems to be giving back to its avid users as well. In its blog post, YouTube said that in a few weeks, YouTube TV users can test out multiviews on their account. They can build their personalized multi-view window that showcases non-sports channels as well. Considering that YouTube is testing this feature out, YouTube says that it is starting "with a small group of popular channels and expanding in the coming months."</p><p>For its Premium users, the streaming platform is immediately rolling out 4x playback speed on mobile devices. This was being tested out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">February</a> and has now finally landed.  More creators will have the ability to voice-respond to comments on their videos.</p><p>Furthermore, users can start creating their personalized radio station with the AI-powered tool called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">Ask Music</a>". You can speak or ask YouTube to create a playlist for you with "upbeat songs for a morning run," "calm jazz for studying," "80s-inspired indie," or even something more specific to your mood. Ask Music is available on iOS and Android for all YouTube Premium and YouTube Music users.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1696px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.54%;"><img id="UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg" name="YouTube-TV- redesign" alt="YouTube player redesign for TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1696" height="942" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, the YouTube TV app is getting a full redesign this summer, the blog post added."Easier navigation, playback, quality tweaks, plus streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing are heading to your screens," YouTube stated.</p><p>The company shared a quick glimpse of what the new UI would look like, featuring video from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl">@LoFiGirl. </a>The controls on the new UI are more spread out when compared to the current version. The channel, description, and subscribe buttons are on the left, the play/pause and next controls are in the center, making it more accessible and prominent. While the other controls, like settings and the like/dislike toggles, remain on the left of the screen, as seen above.</p>

<p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced its first-quarter earnings for this year today (April 24).  The company's revenue exceeded expectations and grew by 12% year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/34/fa/ee06f3de4338b99acffc5c229d9f/2025q1-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf">its earnings report</a>.</p><p>This number is more than what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">analysts were expecting </a>to see ($89.12 billion). If currency fluctuations aren't considered, the company's earnings actually went up by 14%.</p><p>Alphabet's dividend (regular cash payment to shareholders) saw an increase of 5%, so each share will now receive $0.21 per quarter. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed this evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion.</p><p>"We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai</p><p>All of the company's main products saw an overall increase in revenue. To start, the first-quarter earnings report stated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-affordable-ad-free-premium-lite-officially-rolls-out">YouTube's </a>advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion, which is up by 8.4% from the same quarter last year, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">CNBC</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-english-speaking-practice-ai-experiment">Google's Search</a> also saw gained $50.7 billion in revenue this quarter which is up from $46.16 billion in 2024. "Search saw continued strong growth, boosted by the engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-anthos-cross-platform-cloud-strategy-threat-microsoft-azure">Google Cloud</a> also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. According to the report, this was driven by the company's core cloud services, AI infrastructure, and new AI-powered solutions</p><p>With respect to AI, during the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products. Specifically speaking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews</a>, the feature provides you a quick summary of your search has seen "over 1.5 billion users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI mode</a>."</p>

<p>During the call, Pichai was asked about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">company's ongoing trial </a>with the Justice Department. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court?rc=bdqvyp">revealed</a> that Gemini has 35 million daily users, while 122.58 million people use ChatGPT every day, which is a pretty big margin.</p><p>When asked what Google is doing to increase Gemini's daily metrics, Sundar said, " I think we have the best model out there now, and I think I think that's going to drive increased adoption as well."  He noted that they are innovating with AI mode, an exciting roadmap ahead with the Gemini app as well.</p><p>Lastly, Alphabet's ventures outside of Google's products that are capped under "Other Bets" saw a decrease in revenue this quarter. This segment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">generated</a> $450 million in revenue, which is much lower than the $495 million that it made in Q1 last year.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus launched its 13T smartphone in China with a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, a 50MP primary lens, and a 50MP telephoto.</li><li>Internally, the phone rocks the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC with loads of AI advancements for photos, notetaking, and more via ColorOS 15.</li><li>The OnePlus 13T focuses on games, too, offering 120 FPS for MOBAs and optimizations for many popular games.</li><li>The company has not listed a global launch yet for the OnePlus 13T.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out another phone for its consumers; one that's touted with a small screen, but big power.</p><p>Earlier today (Apr. 24), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/13t">the OnePlus 13T launched</a> in China following the company's slew of social media teasers. The latest T-series phone takes things down a notch by offering a smaller form factor for those who love that style. Unlike the flagship OnePlus 13 and its 6.8-inch QHD Plus display, the 13T delivers a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz max refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus is also highlighting the device's lightweight feel, saying users can hold the device one-handed without fatigue.</p><p>A more standout detail is the new "shortcut key." The OnePlus 13T says goodbye to the fabled Alert Slider for this new multipurpose, frame-integrated button. Placed on the top left side of the phone's edge, the shortcut key gives easy access to your flashlight, sound/vibration (Alert Slider-esque), One-click flash memory, DND, recording, camera, and more.</p><p>OnePlus hopes the 13T's small frame won't disappoint as the phone packs a wallop: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-ai-power-2">Gaming & AI Power</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8" name="oneplus-13t-color-options" alt="The OnePlus 13T in a variety of colors: Morning Grey, Heart-pounding Pink, Cloudy Ink Black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this strength has to go somewhere, and OnePlus says the Snapdragon 8 Elite benefits the 13T's gaming capabilities. The company states users can reach up to 120 FPS during MOBA games (think League of Legends) and up to 60 FPS in open-world games (think Genshin Impact).</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus 13T has rich optimization for games such as the ones described to give users a smooth experience when playing.</p><p>The other side of the new phone involves AI advancements, like OnePlus' reflection removal on photos. The 13T also receives AI Elimination (machine-translated), which functions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, letting users quickly remove people and other objects from photos. OnePlus states ColorOS 15 on the phone is smooth, packing more AI features like AI Call Translation, Flash Memory (for notetaking), and more.</p>
<h2 id="long-lasting-glacier-tech-2">Long-lasting Glacier Tech</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.40%;"><img id="YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD" name="oneplus-13t-rendering-official" alt="The OnePlus 13T in gray." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="572" height="580" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With so much under the hood, OnePlus tries to invoke a sense of calm in its users by stating the 13T features its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery technology</a>. However, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-to-sport-a-gigantic-battery-in-its-smaller-form-factor">company recently confirmed</a> on Weibo, the OnePlus 13T is unlike the 13 and 13R counterparts. Each of those features a 6,000mAh battery, while the 13T offers a larger 6,260mAh battery.</p><p>Joining this is 80W super fast charging to ensure users aren't out of the action for long.</p><p>Other specifications include IP65 dust and water resistance, as well as a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto camera. The front-facing lens comes in at 16MP. Users will also find the following RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, 16/1TB.</p><p>For now, the OnePlus 13T has observed a Chinese market launch for 3,999 Chinese Yuan (~$548). There's a chance the company will bring it overseas to the U.S. and other areas, but that remains to be seen. If this does happen, perhaps we're in for a global launch toward the summer.</p>

<p>Motorola's new Razr 2025 lineup is here, and it includes a new member: the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025. While the Razr Plus isn't going anywhere, the Razr Ultra now represents the company's top-of-the-line foldable offering. If you have the Razr Plus 2024, you'll want to compare the last-generation model to the Razr Ultra 2025 — not the Razr Plus 2025.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> earns its new name with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger internal display, and a 50MP selfie camera. However, all of that comes at a high cost. Specifically, the $1,299 sticker price of the Razr Ultra could be a deterrent for some, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> is only getting cheaper by comparison. That's why the older version could actually be the better value.</p><p>Let's break down the differences between the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024, so you can decide which one to buy or whether to upgrade.</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">will become available starting May 15</a>, and pre-orders will start on May 7 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, Amazon, and through Motorola's online store. It starts at $1,300, with a higher-priced 1TB storage configuration available and various carrier and trade-in deals optional. It's available in four Pantone colorways: Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret.</p>

<p>The last-generation Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is still available and has an official retail price of $1,000, but isn't sold at that price often anymore. Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon all currently have the Razr Plus 2024 priced at $800, and that could drop lower once the Razr 2025 lineup is available. It's sold in one 256GB storage configuration in five colorways: Midnight Blue, Hot Pink, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, Paris Hilton Edition, and Mocha Mousse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have extremely similar dimensions, with the biggest differences between them being their weight. The Razr Plus 2024, at 189 grams, is 10 grams lighter than the Razr Ultra 2025. This could be enough to notice in your hand or a pocket, especially when the phone is closed. Otherwise, the Razr Ultra is slightly thicker, but the two clamshell foldables have the same general footprint.</p><p>Motorola significantly improved the Razr's durability with this year's lineup. The Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">now has an IP48 certification</a>, adding dust resistance for the first time. It does have the same water-resistance rating as the Razr Plus 2024, but the older model is IPX8 and this has no dust protection.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Ultra 2025 has a new Gorilla Glass Ceramic covering for the cover display. The Razr Plus 2024 only offers Gorilla Glass Victus, and lacks the titanium-reinforced hinge and new foldable display covering found on the new model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-18" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, you might think that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have the same cover screen. They do, for all intents and purposes, as they're both 4-inch pOLED panels with LTPO technology and 165Hz refresh rates. But the Razr Ultra 2025 has improved peak brightness capabilities, as it can hit 3,000 nits. The Razr Plus 2024 can only peak at 2,400 nits, which could make it harder to use outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other small display tweak is that the Razr Ultra 2025 has a slightly larger inner screen. It's now using a 7-inch pOLED panel, which is ever-so-slightly bigger than the Razr Plus 2024's 6.9-inch pOLED screen. More importantly, the Razr Ultra 2025 can hit 4,500 nits of peak brightness, a significant improvement over the Plus 2024's 3,000-nit capabilities.</p><p>Motorola is deepening its collaboration with Pantone by offering unique colorways and an Alcantara material on the Razr Ultra 2025, but both that model and the Plus 2024 variant have equally-eccentric color and finish options.</p>

<p>Motorola is offering a truly flagship-caliber flip phone with the Razr Ultra 2025, and that starts with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> on the inside. It's built using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores for improved performance and features an AI engine for on-device processing. Plus, the phone now has 16GB of memory for all that AI.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 is using a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip that's now a generation old, but it still should be more than capable for daily use. That's paired with 12GB of memory, which again should suffice. Both phones support 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC.</p>

<p>In a way, the Razr Plus 2024 actually has a better camera system than the Razr Ultra 2025, since the former has a telephoto lens. It's a 50MP, f/2.0 telephoto that provides 2x optical zoom on the Razr Plus 2024. There's no optical zoom on the Razr Ultra, as the phone's secondary camera is a 50MP ultrawide with a 122-degree field of view.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a new main camera: 50MP, f/1.8 sensor with Instant all-pixel PDAF and optical image stabilization. The Razr Plus 2024's main lens is quite similar, though, as it's also a 50MP sensor but with a f/1.7 aperture and only dual-pixel focus. The Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with a 50MP selfie camera, while the Razr Plus 2024 has a 32MP selfie camera.</p><p>Of course, since these are foldables, you can always use the rear cameras as a selfie camera with the cover screen.</p><p>The new model ships with Android 15 out of the box, while the Razr Plus 2024 shipped with Android 14, and both are using Motorola's Hello UI skin. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> is said to be ongoing, but the update has had numerous issues this far. Both phones have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">meager update promise of 3 years of OS upgrades</a> and an extra year of security updates.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 certainly has the specs to command a $1,299 price tag, but there's no doubt that the Razr Plus 2024 is the better value. The phone still offers the same size cover screen, a capable Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor, and a telephoto lens for $500 less than the Ultra 2025 at the time of publishing. It's only getting cheaper, too.</p><p>But if you spring for the Razr Plus 2024, you're accepting a waning software support window that could only see your phone get two more Android OS upgrades — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update that's just months away.</p><p>For those that are willing to pay a lump sum for the best clamshell foldable money can buy in the U.S., the Razr Ultra 2025 is there. There are plenty of durability, performance, and display improvements that can be used to justify the upgrade.

<h2 id="can-border-patrol-search-your-phone-at-the-u-s-border-2">Can border patrol search your phone at the U.S. border?</h2>
<p>Something a little different this week, but it's in the news cycle and is a subject full of questions with very few answers given. I'm talking about crossing into the U.S. and getting your phone searched.</p>
<p>This isn't anything new, or anything because of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cbp_directive_3340-049.pdf" target="_blank">started in 2009</a>, and according to what senior intelligence officials have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-citizens-u-s-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone-n732746" target="_blank">told NBC News</a>, ramped up in 2016 when the FBI was unable to stop American citizens from conducting attacks inside the country they call home.</p><p>It's also not unique to the U.S. and many countries will want to look at your phone, tablet, and laptop upon arrival. I can only speak of what I know, though, so this is going to be very U.S.-centric.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices#:~:text=CBP's%20border%20authorities%20permit%20the,devices%20crossing%20our%20nation's%20borders." target="_blank"><strong>The United States Customs and Border Patrol can search any object, without any specific level of suspicion, within 100 miles of the U.S. border. That means your backpack, wallet, car, and phone.</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Civil rights groups and lawmakers are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DHS%20re%20border%20searches.pdf" target="_blank">split over the constitutionality</a> of this, but the Department of Homeland Security stands firm that it can conduct warrantless searches of electronics at the U.S. border and they have more guns so they win.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5312px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad" name="airport.jpg" alt="Dulles International Airport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5312" height="2988" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="can-i-refuse-should-i-2">Can I refuse? Should I?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can refuse but not without consequences. Those depend on your citizenship status.</p><p>If you are an American citizen your electronics can be forcibly removed from your person, but you can not be compelled to provide the password. I said <strong>password</strong> intentionally here because court cases have affirmed that law enforcement can force you to provide a fingerprint or other form of biometric authentication but can not compel you to give up your password.</p><p>Your device can be held for an undetermined amount of time or even denied entry, but you can not be because you did not provide your password. they'll have to find another reason if they want to deny you entry or detain you, and they probably will.</p><p>If you are not a U.S. citizen the answer is easier; turn over the phone and the password if asked or go back home. The government says you have no right to enter the country and you have to follow all rules and directives to gain access. If you don't, you are turned away.</p>
<p>As for what you should do, well that's not for me to say. I know what I would do and why: I would tell them I am a U.S. citizen and they can pound sand, let them hold me against the wall and pull my phone out of my pocket, and never tell them the password. I will never give up an inch of my liberty willingly and unless they helped pay for the phone or the service, they aren't getting it.</p><p>That's a narrow and possibly dangerous way to think and I can't recommend it. But you need to ask yourself the same question and form your own answer.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7" name="android-enterprise-recommended-hero.jpg" alt="Android Enterprise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The first thing to do if you carry a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-enterprise-recommended">work phone</a> is ask your boss what to do. Your company probably has very strict access rules for its information and may have an existing policy; a large car manufacturer has told its employees to refuse and get on the first plane back to Germany, for example.</p><p>For your personal device, you can do a few things to minimize your personal risk. There are two levels of search, a basic search and a seizure. For a basic search an officer will gain access and look through your device, They will look at your photos, messages, social media, etc. to see if they find anything suspicious.</p><p>The next level involves an agent connecting your phone to equipment that clones the data so it can be looked at more thoroughly. This requires "reasonable suspicion" though what that is has never been defined.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security"><em><strong>See our guide to the best phones for security in 2025</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>What I would do if I were a foreign national on the way into the U.S., and what I'll recommend to you isn't difficult at all: don't give them any reason to be suspicious.</p><p><strong>Do not wipe your phone</strong>. Presenting a phone that's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">reset</a> is the opposite of not acting suspiciously. Don't do it.</p><p><strong>Turn off biometrics</strong>. this doesn't protect you if you're not a citizen, but it's a hurdle that's not suspicious. If they want in, make them ask and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-disable-biometrics-on-your-android-phone-from-the-lock-screen">allow access on your terms</a>.</p><p><strong>Make sure you haven't turned off encryption</strong>. That's not easy to do and unless you did something you found on the internet, you probably didn't. This goes for your apps, their associated data, and the entire contents of the phone itself. When the screen is locked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly">everything should be encrypted</a>.</p><p><strong>Don't delete your social media</strong>. Clean it up instead. Delete any posts you think might cause you trouble in case they are saved on your phone.</p><p><strong>Delete your local data</strong>. Go through your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-spice-up-your-pictures-with-ultra-hdr-glow">photos</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-and-when-clear-app-cache-or-data-android">application cache</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-clear-browsing-data-shortcut">browser history</a>, and anything else that stores what you're been doing and erase it.</p><p><strong>Disconnect your phone</strong> <strong>from the internet</strong>. CBP is not allowed to look through your online data, but your apps often present it when opened. If you're not connected, they can't. Legally, an officer is required to ask you to disconnect from the internet before a search of your phone is started. Don't wait for them to ask.</p><p><strong>Don't be a jerk</strong>. It might be tempting and I know I would do or say something stupid, but try not to. If you're acting like a jerk they might, too. Follow directions and ask questions respectfully no matter how you feel about the situation.</p>

<p>Realistically, your phone probably isn't going to be searched upon entry. Certain groups have a higher chance (no, we're not diving into that plie of racism and xenophobia) and are treated differently, but at most expect a cursory look at your phone when you come into the country.</p><p>If it does happen, be prepared. It's a price you might have to pay if you want to visit the U.S.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung's development of a Galaxy S25 FE continues, but with some older internal tech.</li><li>The device may feature the company's toned-down Exynos 2400e, the same chip found inside the S24 FE.</li><li>Samsung has done this before, like the Galaxy S23 FE, which features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors say Samsung's next flagship series' FE device is real, but it might not excite you with raw strength.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-m36-5g-soc-leak-3546771/">Android Authority</a> through a "reliable source" states internal code points toward the existence of a Galaxy S25 FE. The post says Samsung typically attaches an "R" modifier to devices belonging to its FE series. With that in mind, there's reportedly code with the name "R13," which seemingly points toward the S25 FE.</p><p>A more usual/normal codename that we're used to hearing about wasn't readily available, but this might be our first glimpse of its development.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung's internal code details another important aspect of the phone: its potential SoC. Sources lead the publication to believe the device could launch with the Exynos 2400e SoC due to its internal tag appearing alongside code for the S25 FE.</p>
<h2 id="year-old-tech-again-2">Year-Old Tech... Again?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-mint-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can take these rumors with a grain of salt, considering how the device might not launch for a while. However, there's a chance this could come to fruition, considering Samsung has a past of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">using year-old tech in its FE phones</a>. One device we can look back on is the Galaxy S23 FE. After launching in the fall of 2023, its detailed specs showed Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, the flagship chip choice for phones launching in 2022.</p><p>What's arguably the most relevant example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>. The alleged chip for the S25 FE, the Exynos 2400e, is currently featured inside Samsung's latest fan edition phone. It's worth keeping in mind that while it wasn't a bad chip, for its time last September, the 2400e is roughly 100MHz slower than its stronger 2400.</p><p>The chip clocks in at 3.11GHz, which is far slower than Samsung's recent choice of the Snapdragon 8 Elite with a 4.47GHz in its flagship S25 trio.</p><p>The idea of a "Fan Edition" phone is to appeal to the more affordable market, so it's expected not to hold the same power as a flagship. We'll have to see where things end up, as rumors claim the Galaxy S25 FE could see a launch in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>Anyone my age will likely recall seeing Toy Story for the first time. I had just celebrated my 10th birthday a few weeks before its release, and to say I was thrilled to see toys come to life in fancy new CG animation was an understatement. It also helped that Pixar was a master at storytelling.</p><p>The idea of toys themselves moving around and playing was a concept that continued to stick with me over the years. Toy Commander, a 1999 Dreamcast release, remains one of the most memorable games of my childhood because it shares that same theme, and now some recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest 3 games</a> have caught my attention in the same way.</p><p>Recently, Plastic Battlegrounds has been trending <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@plasticbattlegrounds">on TikTok</a>, racking up millions of views with shorts that perfectly recreate those moments when you played with plastic army men as a kid. The difference is that now you're not just moving the little guys around, you're actually fighting alongside them, commanding them, or just seeing what it's like to pretend to be Sid.</p>

<h2 id="plastic-battlegrounds-2">Plastic Battlegrounds</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frQwGO665I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Plastic Battlegrounds debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/plastic-battlegrounds/7796723770415439/">on the Meta Quest platform</a> on October 14, 2024. While it's a sandbox game still very much in development, the classic theme and the impulse buy price of $9.99 quickly rocketed it to success. The game describes itself as "<strong>the</strong> newly commissioned sandbox toy-based battle simulator where your plastic soldiers engage in intense set piece battles of your imagination."</p><p>That last part is key. Plastic Battlegrounds isn't going to blow anyone's minds with its advanced AI or cutting-edge graphics. The game looks fine enough on a Meta Quest 3S, but the real joy is recreating scenes from your childhood and, maybe even more relevant today, <em>making content</em> from those ideas.</p><p>Because, let's face it, there's something fun about making your own version of Toy Story with your own ideas at the helm. Since you can choose either to embody a toy soldier or get a kids-eye view of the scene and command them, there are plenty of ways to work the angles and come up with a creative story along the way.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv37Nb54D6M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The video above embodies the true spirit of the game and what I think is the real fun in playing it: pretending. There's something truly amazing about seeing plastic soldiers come to life. Being able to spawn them and command them just adds a cherry on top, and the game's different levels all help realize a childhood fantasy of being a tiny toy in a giant room.</p>

<p>The developers specifically note that Plastic Battlegrounds was designed as a sandbox game, but two other modes are currently available and in active development. "Sandbox would be the optimal game mode to get the most out of the Plastic Battlegrounds experience," they note, and it's clear from social media posts that people love playing this way.</p><p>In this mode, you embody a plastic soldier and can spawn, command, and fight your own way through an unlimited number of enemies and scenarios. A bunch of different maps — kitchen, basement, hallway, backyard, etc. — give you different parts of the house to play in, and each of the two alternative modes gives you additional options.</p><p>Spawning in units is simple, but you'll want to be careful not to spam that spawn button too many times. While a Quest 3 or 3S can handle lots of units just fine, a Quest 2 will have a tougher time managing a decent framerate. I look forward to seeing where this game's development takes it, especially if the developers can get a good multiplayer mode going.</p>

<p>Plastic Battlegrounds might be trending right now, but it was Toy Trains VR that gave me the first "Toy Story" feelings more than a year ago. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/toy-trains/5655022154520888/">Toy Trains VR</a> is an absolutely brilliant puzzle game that's polished in a way most Meta Quest games wish they could be. The goal is to assemble a toy train track to connect all the towns in an area, helping to transport goods between each location.</p><p>The game sports a uniquely toy-like quality with excellent graphics — complete with a fur-shaded carpet — all of which takes place in your grandfather's attic. I can remember venturing up to my grandparent's attic when I was a kid and finding similar sets of trains, so this one immediately evoked a sense of nostalgia for me.</p>

<p>What I love about Toy Trains VR is that it's not just a sandbox game, although there is a sandbox mode if you love that sort of thing. Rather, the main single player mode follows a heartwarming story that's well put together AND well voiced, something that adds a rather intriguing bit of character to what would otherwise be "just a puzzle game."</p><p>And that brings me to the mechanics. The available tracks are cleverly laid out for you to grab, letting you know exactly how many, and what type, of pieces are available for you to finish each puzzle. The introductory levels are quite easy and give you a good idea of what to expect, while the later levels will provide sufficient challenges for even hardcore puzzle fans (that is a thing, right?).</p>

<p>Before both of these other games, though, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lego-bricktales-meta-quest-3-impressions">LEGO Bricktales</a>. This brilliant puzzle platformer puts a life-sized LEGO diorama in front of players' faces, letting you control a LEGO character that traverses each area as you build the missing pieces.</p><p>It was originally shown off as one of the premier mixed reality titles when the Meta Quest 3 was first announced, and the result was even better than I had hoped. While some might have just wanted a plain sandbox LEGO game, I far prefer this style of storytelling that melds nicely with LEGO construction.</p><p>While most LEGO games are the same — third-person action games with lots of combat and collection but little brain usage — LEGO Bricktales rewards players who enjoy exploration and puzzle solving. It's particularly amazing being able to fully walk around these life-sized dioramas and find the secrets hidden within.</p><p>There's a serious childlike wonderment that bubbles up inside me while playing this game, and it made me freshly appreciate the spatial nature of VR games. It's even nicer that you can have the whole game hover in front of you no matter where you stand (or sit), giving you the freedom to fully explore or build each piece as if it were real.</p>

<p>Watch faces on Wear OS are one of the best ways to let your personality shine, and I frequently swap between them based on my mood. But one thing I hadn't considered before someone asked me was which Wear OS brand had the <em>best</em> watch faces.</p><p>So I fired up my Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Google Pixel Watch 3 to look through every watch face, complication, and color variations available, and compare what style and data they bring to the table.</p><p>Then I bullied my colleagues Andrew Myrick and Nick Sutrich into looking through every watch face on their TicWatch Atlas and OnePlus Watch 3, respectively, since I wanted every Wear OS brand (besides the Eurasia-only Xiaomi) represented.</p><p>Let's dive in and compare first-party Wear OS watch faces for style, variety, customization, and quantity.</p>

<p>The sheer diversity of watch faces in the Galaxy Wearable app is impressive. Virtually every non-gimmicky Samsung-made watch face has dozens of colors, several customizations, and more system complications than any other brand, while the downloadable third-party options have more limited variations but give you a wider range of styles.</p><p>I highly recommend using the Wearable phone app to look through and edit your watch faces; the on-watch customization options work well enough, but some "premade" variations only show up in the mobile app.</p><p>Specific to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, you'll find some Ultra watch faces that take advantage of the extra space to fit up to eight complications. I typically use this for my Samsung Health data, but there's a wide range of Google- and Samsung-made toggles for popular apps.</p>

<p>More generally, Samsung has more animated or "live" watch faces than other Wear OS brands, like Funny faces, My style, Live Wallpaper, or Friends. They're quite cool (if a bit distracting), with unique smarts like pointing out when you have unread notifications or swapping patterns with a tap.</p><p>Once the novelty wears off, I avoid animated watch faces, not only because of battery drain, but also because they rarely leave room for any non-clock data fields. The latter also applies to custom faces like Google Photos or Bitmoji.</p><p>Out of Samsung's watch face categories, I'm a fan of the Analog and Informative faces: they squeeze in tons of useful information while making that crowdedness look intentional and stylish. For something more colorful and minimalistic, the Numbers faces are great.</p><p>I'm less of a fan of the Classic and Simple faces, because they look a bit too minimalist and don't really fit the <em>look</em> of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or Ultra; they'd be better suited to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>.</p>

<p>Google made the smart choice of making every premade watch face customization visible in the main "Add watch faces" menu. So even though it has half as many official watch faces as Samsung, it <em>looks</em> like hundreds because each face has 5–10 premade variations.</p><p>Plus, Google lets you look at and customize faces before committing to one, while Samsung makes you add them to your watch before you can see your options.</p><p>Logistics aside, half of Google's watch faces follow the Material You aesthetic with bright colors and large clocks that run up against the edge of the rounded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 </a>display. The rest either fall into data-heavy fitness or traditional classic/ analog faces that you see on most smartwatches.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick said that Pixel Watch faces "have the best style because they fit so well with the watch's aesthetic, but a lot of them are pretty useless other than to tell the time."</p><p>I'm quoting him because I couldn't put it better myself: faces like Digital Bold, Big Time, Abstract, and Vista look striking enough, but some — especially Large Scale and Prime — are a bit too simplistic with their sans-serif fonts and empty space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-main-watch-face.jpeg" alt="The default Active watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Active watch face </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google made "Active" the default face for a reason, I think. Its rounded fonts and bright colors look Google-ish, but it leaves plenty of room for Fitbit complications or Google app shortcuts that people buy Pixel Watches for. I tend to like the busyness of the Field and Adventure faces more than the minimalist look of faces like Index and Utility.</p><p>Whichever watch face you end up with, I think Google does the best job of making its AOD-mode faces look like a stylish inverse of the active face, while other brands' AOD mode simply dims the screen or removes elements.</p>

<p>Nick looked over each of the 19 OnePlus watch faces, but admitted that after his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3 review</a>, he's continued to stick with the default watch face, whereas he didn't care for the main Watch 2 face.</p><p>"I feel like all of the best ones on this watch take full advantage of the 1.5-inch screen size and cram a bunch of info onto it," Nick explained, "whereas my favorite Pixel Watch faces are very minimalist because they look good on the shape."</p><p>While OnePlus has a decent amount of variety and plenty of complications, none of its alternative watch faces have tempted Nick to switch. It's been a while since I've taken out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, but I also don't recall its official watch faces being particularly striking during that review stretch.</p><p>OnePlus does have a unique video watch face feature, but like Samsung's animated faces, I doubt people will stick with this battery-draining gimmick. I think a bigger priority for OnePlus is to add more stylish watch faces in general that match with its Classic titanium chic.</p>
<h2 id="mobvoi-ticwatch-faces-2">Mobvoi TicWatch faces</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-1" alt="TicWatch Atlas sitting in dirt and rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Andrew, like Nick, isn't that impressed with the watch faces on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-review">TicWatch Atlas</a>. Of the 15 available — including the TimeShow app — he says that he regularly switches between five of them. That's not a bad rotation, but he "doesn't have much of an opinion on the other 10 besides them just taking up space." Ouch!</p><p>His favorite, shown in the photo above, is the same sort of data-heavy, fitness-focused face that you'd expect on any fitness watch, focused on cramming in a lot of information. Compared to that, the faces that "try to look like an 'actual' watch just aren't that appealing" to Andrew.</p><p>Part of this comes down to preference, of course, but it's also fair to point out that because Mobvoi has fewer first-party watch faces than most Wear OS brands, you're less likely to find many that fit your tastes.</p><p>Thankfully, Mobvoi does at least have plenty of Google and TicWatch complications available, if not quite as many as its Wear OS rivals. You also get an ultra-basic watch face on the battery-saving secondary screen that does, at least, come in dozens of color options.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-the-best-wear-os-brand-for-watch-faces-2">Which is the best Wear OS brand for watch faces?</h2>

<p>Objectively, it's hard to argue against Samsung Galaxy Watches here. Whether you prefer classic, analog, minimalist, data-heavy, or gimmicky motion watch faces, Samsung gives you the most options, with different fits to match the standard, Classic, or Ultra models.</p><p>Google prioritizes style over ruggedness, and the lack of a bezel makes its faces stand out more prominently than other brands' faces. But your opinion of them will depend on what you think of Google's modern Material You theming. You get very few "classic" faces, and it's hard to differentiate between faces when every single one has a black background.</p><p>Either brand gives you plenty of customization options, but I think Samsung lets you choose one to match your personality while Google railroads you a bit to its style.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm happy with what both brands bring to the table, but I still think that Google needs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">unblock Facer</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> so that it's easier to find third-party options outside of the messy Play Store. And I'm also curious if Google will consider letting us use Gemini to generate pretty watch face backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a 7-inch, 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD inner screen with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 4,500 nits peak brightness. It’s a Pantone-validated display so you’ll get Pantone-validated colors and skin tones. The outer screen is a 4-inch pOLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with the same adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Available in Pantone colors, including Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret, you can choose from luxe satin-inspired or durable leather-inspired finishes. It’s the first phone to use Italian Alcantara material, the same you’ll find on items like Louis Vuitton bags. There’s also an option for FSC-certified wood so you can choose the design and material that suits you.</p><p>Covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic, the phone is durable, marking the toughest external display of any Razr to date. The phone meets an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance. It has a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel and can withstand up to 35% more folds than the previous generation device. Ultra-thin glass also ensures a smoother display.</p><p>Customize the external display with dedicated panels for things like contacts, communications apps, streaming music, weather, and more. The phone also has dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and three microphones.</p><p>Equipped with 512GB or 1TB storage, you can load tons of games, apps, photos, videos, and more onto this 5G foldable phone. It charges via USB-C and has a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W TurboPower charging (get a full day in just eight minutes) as well as 30W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes in Blue, Yellow, Mint, or Silver Shadow, plus Samsung exclusive colors Crafted Black, White, and Peach. The foldable design consists of a 3.4-inch 720 x 748 inner Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and 1,700 nits peak brightness that unfolds to reveal the larger 6.7-inch 2,640 x 1,080 FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x 120Hz main screen with 2,600 nits brightness.</p><p>Slim and compact with a floating design, the phone is relatively durable, sporting an IP48 rating for resistance against dust and water as well. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and it has a reinforced folding edge with the FlexHinge for easily opening and closing it along with an Armor Aluminum frame with a matte finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">review of the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> that the hinge is stiff and sturdy, as is the phone in its entirety. He adds that the crease is hardly noticeable.</p><p>Lee isn’t fond of the design of the external screen, however, finding that it offers limited ability to interact with notifications or even scroll through details or select different days. He also finds that apps feel condensed, making navigating UIs awkward.</p><p>Equipped with 256GB or 512GB non-expandable storage, the 5G device charges via USB-C, the port of which also works as an ear jack. Other specs include Bluetooth 5.3, GPS, NFC, and stereo speakers. The dialogue booster feature is appreciated, and Lee says it does “exactly as it states, and works surprisingly well.” He also loves the haptics that emit a slight vibration when you type, swipe back, or open the sidebar.</p><p>The phone runs on a 4,000mAh battery and supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It lasts all day on a single charge: Lee would get from about 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. before needing to recharge. But it charges much more slowly than the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, so this is worth keeping in mind for power users.</p>

<p>As a newer phone released in late April 2025, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes loaded with Android 15. If following the pattern of other Razr devices, you should get three years of software and four years of security updates, which is decent but not quite as long as Samsung’s standard.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite octa-core processor, making it the most powerful foldable phone on the market today. It also comes with an impressive 16GB RAM. It also supports Motorola’s RAM Boost feature which allows you to convert available storage space to RAM when needed, though we’ve had mixed experiences with this feature in the past.</p><p>The phone is built with moto AI, which includes tons of cool AI-powered features leveraging the dedicated on-device AI engine, like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This. Next Move takes advantage of the external display, recognizing what’s on the screen and offering suggestions for the next step. It could be, for example, generating a playlist with Playlist Studio while you bake a cake from an online recipe, or creating an image or wallpaper in Image Studio that’s inspired by an upcoming trip.</p><p>There’s also Smart Connect with AI that allows you to use voice or text commands to do things like pull up a video on your big screen TV or mirror content to a secondary device like a PC or tablet for multitasking. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 even has a dedicated AI key that you can press to access moto AI at any time. In his initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">hands-on review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, Lee says he appreciates this dedicated button versus having this feature double on the power button.</p><p>Flip the phone into stand or tent mode and chat hands-free with moto AI to ask questions, summarize notifications, or transcribe conversations. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with Google’s Gemini and Gemini Live access so you can use this smart assistant and all the features that come with it as well. Lee is impressed by the addition of even more AI apps, like Meta’s Llama, Microsoft Copilot, and even Perplexity. Motorola is really upping its AI game with this phone.</p><p>We’ll provide more details on the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 once we have had more time to spend with it and can deliver a full review.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes loaded with Android 14 with One UI 6.1.1 since it’s already a year old. However, you get seven years of software and security updates. So, you can not only update to Android 15, you’ll be able to continue updating for another six years to come.</p><p>Running on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 octa-core processor, Lees says it performs “exceptionally well…this phone breezes through everything you throw at it.” It has a Vapor Chamber to keep it cool while multitasking or gaming, marking a first for a Galaxy Z Flip device. Lee says it occasionally gets warm while gaming, but never uncomfortably hot. Equipped with 12GB RAM, this phone can keep up with the most demanding tasks and games.</p><p>Built with Galaxy AI and Google Gemini, you get the same Google Gemini AI experiences that are available in other AI-powered phones, like Circle to Search, live translate, and transcript assist. You can use the Gemini assistant for everything from help composing e-mails to summarizing webpages and booking vacations. But there are also some unique Galaxy AI features that make use of the foldable design.</p><p>There’s interpreter, for example, that leverages the Flex Window for real-time language translations, one of the top features for making use of the external display. Lee finds that it works well. With Chat Assist, you can send messages directly from the FlexWindow, even choosing from suggested replies that are curated by the content-aware AI.</p><p>Lee loves features like Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image, which he calls “truly fascinating,” turning your doodles into works of art. He’s less impressed with Portrait Studio but loves the Live Effect feature for transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos. Other worthwhile features include Slo-Mo for saving clips, Composer for writing comments, e-mails, and more based on past conversations and prompts, and the Recorder app.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-02" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 in a red ring stand case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For taking photos and videos, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a triple 50MP camera system that includes a main 50MP camera, a 50MP ultra-wide camera with Macro Vision, and a 50MP front camera. You get features like Super Zoom and plenty of the usual camera modes.</p><p>There’s also Group Shot for capturing multiple frames within a second and seamlessly blending them together for a perfect shot. With Action Shot, you can get blur-free photos of subjects on the move as the shutter speed adjusts automatically based on lighting conditions. And there’s Air Gesture for capturing photos and videos using hand gestures to start, stop, and pause recording. Leverage Flex View positions as well for things like tripod shots, gesture controls, and external previews.</p><p>We haven’t been able to spend significant time with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just yet to provide feedback on the camera experience. Stay tuned!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take photos from the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using the 50MP main camera along with the 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP front “selfie” camera. There are options like Nightography, instant slo-mo, and live effect, all of which make use of the ProVisual Engine. There are plenty of photography features powered by AI as well, like generative edit.</p><p>Lee finds that photos have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy with this phone, though he says the camera does struggle with dynamic range. Skies in photos, for example, will often appear blown out. The cameras also struggle with movement, so you may end up with blurry images that lack detail and with some distortion at the edges of the image if the subject is moving. But he was able to capture some great moving images of objects like cars and animals like a cat.</p><p>The camera handles zooming and low light well, he adds, but he isn’t a fan of how his darker skin looks when taking selfies with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. Given the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025’s focus on skin tones, this gives it a massive leg up in this department.</p><p>For recording videos, Lee loves the feature that turns the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 into a camcorder when you fold it 90° and hold it sideways. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder at the top half while you can use a zoom slider on the bottom while recording. Neat! He recommends downloading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a> to get more useful features, including a 2x button for faster zooming, auto HDR, and a faster shutter button.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3878px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="J8ZiCbu3S8MbeR34ZNnQ4d" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-07" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8ZiCbu3S8MbeR34ZNnQ4d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3878" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes down to specs of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is the all-around better phone. It has larger screens yet isn’t that much bigger. It has a bigger battery, a better front camera, and tons of AI features through both Gemini and moto AI.</p><p>It has more RAM, more storage, charges more quickly, and comes in tons of finish and material options. If you’re not already within the Samsung ecosystem and you’re looking for a solid foldable phone, it’s the better model to consider. But it’s also more expensive so it will make a bigger dent in your wallet. That’s the one early concern Lee has, despite noting that the phone is a huge step up with “the best hardware and all the AI it can include in its phones.”</p><p>Plus, this phone won’t be supported for as long as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which will be up to date for another six years. If longevity is your main concern, you’ll get more bang for the buck with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. And it has some really impressive features, too.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 currently ranks as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phone</a>, but the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is prepped to give it a run for its money. If you have the money to spare and you’re looking for an ultra-durable, feature-rich foldable phone, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is certainly one to consider.</p>

<ul><li>Google has kickstarted an Extended Repair Program for users with a Pixel 7a.</li><li>This comes off the back of it identifying issues of "battery swelling," which could lead to a bulging rear panel and quicker than normal battery drain.</li><li>If users have an impacted device, they must run through the checks to see if they're eligible to see their next steps.</li><li>Google's had to run similar programs for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 4 XL, as well as a few Fitbit devices earlier this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly identified a problematic battery issue plaguing the Pixel 7a and is detailing your next steps if affected.</p><p>The company published a support document for the Pixel 7a's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453">Extended Repair Program</a>, which concerns a "battery swelling" issue (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/23/pixel-7a-extended-repair-program/">9to5Google</a>). User reports may have tipped Google off about this issue. The company states it has "determined that certain Pixel 7a phones may experience unexpected battery swelling." Battery swelling is a serious issue that consumers should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">deal with accordingly</a> should their device shows signs of it.</p><p>Google states you can identify instances of battery swelling if the back of your phone is bulging/appears thicker than usual. Moreover, you'll notice small gaps around the edge of your phone, indicating the battery is pressing against and lifting its back panel.</p><p>Once you've checked to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">if your Pixel 7a is eligible</a>, Google says impacted devices can receive "one battery replacement at no charge" through its battery replacement program. Additionally, Google will conduct a thorough inspection of the device to ensure you can receive this treatment. Keep in mind that if your battery displays any sign of liquid damage, sharp object exposure, or "excessive force," that may void your eligibility for a free replacement through the program.</p>

<p>Once you've gone through the checks, Google says users should find mail-in and walk-in repair center options. Those in the U.S. and India will find both options available; however, others in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Singapore will only have the repair center choice available.</p><p>Also, these countries, excluding the U.S. and India, will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453#:~:text=and%20warranty%20status).-,Appeasement%20options,-Carefully%20select%20your">a few appeasement options</a> for their Pixel 7a troubles. Such options include a $200 payment (converted to a user's local currency).</p><p>Google has a history of running repair programs for its Pixel phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-goes-all-in-on-fixing-pixel-8-screen-issues-with-a-warranty-extension">like the Pixel 8</a> in 2024. Users reported screen issues for a few months, prompting the company to take action and solve the issues: vertical lines and randomly turning green. If consumers had an "Impacted Device," Google was granting a three-year extended warranty to cover users.

<h2 id="how-to-pick-the-right-shade-of-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-to-buy-2">How to pick the right shade of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 to buy</h2>
<p>Motorola has finally released a proper flagship, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top-of-the-line foldable</a> with a thousand-dollar price tag to match. It only makes sense that the most exciting foldable of the year so far should come in four colors that are the opposite of cliche. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 color is available in a quad of striking colors. Choosing the right one involves listening to your inner desires and color matching the Razr Ultra to your style.</p><p>Rio Red is all class and elegance. This deep brick red hue is warm, luxurious, and rich. It isn't as bright as some of the other reds we've seen from Motorola, but this might be a good thing for folks who prefer more muted shades. It's the most striking colorway to go for, especially in that timeless vegan leather finish.</p><p>The other hue that demands attention this time around is the wooden Mountain Trail variant in all of its champagne gold glory. It's almost deceptive to the eye because the wood somehow emanates a metallic texture. This captivating Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 colorway is my second recommendation if the Rio Red just isn't doing it for you. Mountain Trail has oomph and pizzaz, sure to dazzle you for all the years you hold on to your Razr Ultra.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola's big day continues as the company prepares a couple of accessories to get along with its latest foldable trio.</p><p>No smartphone (or foldable) launch is complete without a new pair of earbuds, at least that's what Motorola thinks, per a press release. Today (Apr. 24), the company launched the Moto Buds Loop, its first open-ear buds that seek to blend style and comfort with Sound by Bose tech.  While remaining sleek and light, Motorola says the Buds Loop will "mold to users' ears" when worn.</p><p>Delivering this strong sound are 12mm ironless drivers, which Motorola claims will make your beats come to life. Additionally, the open-ear buds contain spatial audio capabilities, enabling consumers to hear aspects of music and videos they never knew were there.</p>
<h2 id="moto-buds-loop-2">Moto Buds Loop</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="QYnjc4PWhLRY2E8XYDH82e" name="motorola-buds-loop-french-oak" alt="The Moto Buds Loop sitting on a plane's window in French Oak." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYnjc4PWhLRY2E8XYDH82e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Though sleek and stylish, Motorola remains confident in the durability of its first open-ear buds. The post claims the device can withstand the "wear and tear" of daily life as it leverages premium materials for its water repellent design. Motorola says this should aid users who love hitting the gym or going for a stroll in some light rain. Bringing everything together is the Loop's long-standing battery.</p><p>The open-ear buds feature a battery that lasts roughly 8 hours on a single full charge. However, if you've got its case handy, the Buds Loop can grab a total of 37 hours from it.</p><p>Earbuds are good for talking to, and Motorola says your voice will remain clear, thanks to CrystalTalk AI. The Buds Loop contains a dual-mic system, which captures your voice with "precision" while also "minimizing background noise." AI aids users' voices, but the implementation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> works to enhance your daily routines. Motorola says when users connect their Buds Loop to their device — say, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">a Motorola Razr 2025</a> — they can "trigger Moto AI actions with simple voice commands."</p><p>These commands include notification summaries and audio recordings. Smart Connect support is also available for consumers, making it easy to swap sound between Motorola and Lenovo devices "without interruption."</p><p>The Moto Buds Loop will be available this summer in "select" countries. Users will be notified of its official pricing closer to launch. What's more, the Buds Loop is prepared to launch in Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak, featuring crystals by Swarovski. Keep in mind, the French Oak option will vary in availability.</p>

<p>New phone, new earbuds; how about a new watch? Motorola drops the details for its new Watch Fit, a device designed to handle the hustle and bustle of a busy life. Remaining close to Motorola "sleek and fashionable" focus, the Watch Fit delivers a 1.9-inch OLED display that's protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Motorola states the device is equipped with 1,000nits of peak brightness, to ensure you're able to see the important stuff even in broad daylight.</p><p>Speaking of daylight, the Watch Fit keeps health and fitness at its core. While the device can "seamlessly integrate with any Android," the Watch Fit tracks workouts and monitors your wellness. The post says the watch offers over 100 sports modes, advanced heart rate tracking, and built-in GPS for walks. If you are out on a run or in the gym, the Watch Fit's IP68 and 5 ATM water resistance ratings ensure dirt and sweat aren't a worry.</p><p>When the night comes, the Watch Fit's sleep monitoring software works to improve your sleep by delivering "actionable" insights.</p><p>Users can grab the Moto Watch app to track fitness goals and more on their phones. Moreover, the Watch Fit's phone integration makes it so you never have to reach for your phone, as it offers its own set of media controls, photo capture buttons, and more. Powering consumers through their days is a 16-day battery life when fully charged.</p><p>The Moto Watch Fit will be available "over the coming weeks;" however, official pricing will surface closer to that date. Users should also get ready to see it in Pantone-curated Trekking Green with the additional option of third-party 22mm bands.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 series is finally here, and for the first time, Motorola brings its Razr series as a trio, showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra.</p><p>Motorola states that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a> was designed keeping style and durability in mind. The phones get a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices.</p><p>All three models come packed with Moto AI features that are said to go beyond a "traditional assistant" and be more of an "intuitive companion" to the user.  The existing Moto AI suite gets three additional advanced features previously in beta: <strong>Catch Me Up</strong>, <strong>Pay Attention</strong>,<strong> and Remember This</strong>.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile, a new feature, <strong>Next Move</strong>, recognizes what’s on the screen, like a new recipe or trip itinerary, and offers suggestions for next steps.</p><p>In addition to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite, the phones come equipped with Google's Gemini features, which provide additional support for writing, problem-solving, and creative thinking.

<p>The new Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. At first glance, it holds the same design and overall look as previous Motorola Razr models; however, the Ultra, as the name suggests, is larger.</p><p>The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display. To ensure these displays remain intact, the phone features the toughest external display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The cover display boasts 3,000 nits of peak brightness and a 165 Hz refresh rate, while the internal display features 4,500 nits of peak brightness, maintaining the same 165 Hz refresh rate.</p><p>At its core, the device is powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, much like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android phones</a> on the market. As for the camera, the Ultra model comes with a major upgrade, featuring a 50MP primary camera and an additional 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera. Additionally, it also features a 50 MP selfie camera, which sets it apart from the rest of the Razr models.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 has become a middle child of sorts, considering the Ultra has now become the company's premium model. Looking a lot like its predecessor, the Razr Plus 2025 gets an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display.</p><p>While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits and features a 165 Hz refresh rate. The display features Gorilla Glass Victus protection, and a soft, non-slip leather-inspired finish enhances the overall feel of the new Razr Plus. At the same time, the device features a 6000 series high-strength aluminum frame and a stronger "Titanium-reinforced" hinge.</p><p>At the heart of the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </a>chipset, similar to the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch"> Razr Plus 2024</a>. The new Razr Plus 2025 also retains the same camera specs as last year's model. It comes with a 50 MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera. The Plus model, like the rest of the series, also features IP48 dust and water protection.</p>

<p>Not much has changed when it comes to the device's battery capacity as well. The phone arrives with a 4,000 mAh battery that supports 45W TurboPower charging as well as 15W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.</p><p>As for the colors, the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink. The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99.</p>

The Razr 2025, Razr Plus 2025, and Razr Ultra 2025 are all IP48 certified, which means they can withstand submersion in 1.5 meters of water for up to 30 minutes in fresh water. </p></article></section>
<h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-motorola-razr-2025-s-water-and-dust-resistance-2">Everything you need to know about the Motorola Razr 2025's water and dust resistance</h2>
<p>Foldable phones are historically less durable than their traditional counterparts, but recent iterations have bucked that trend. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr 2025</a>, the phone's improved IP48 certification adds dust resistance for the first time but leaves the water-resistance capabilities unchanged. In an IP (ingress protection) rating, the first number represents a device's dust-resistance rating, and the second number represents the water-resistance rating.</p><p>The IP48 rating ensures that the Motorola Razr 2025 will be able to survive being submerged in 1.5 meters (just under five feet) of water for up to half an hour in ideal conditions. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean" target="_blank">IP certification tests</a> are conducted in fresh water, so your phone won't be as protected if it is dropped in a chemically cleaned pool, like a chlorine pool. The same goes for salt water, whether that's a saltwater pool or a day at the beach.</p><p>Salt water and electronics don't mix, meaning you'll want to keep your Razr 2025 out of it, despite the phone's IP48 certification.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also worth noting that these IP certifications cover the Motorola Razr 2025's capabilities when it is brand new. After the Razr 2025 is dropped or mishandled, the waterproofing seal or gaskets could be damaged. It's important to remember that any phone's water-resistance capabilities will naturally degrade over time.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025's upgraded IP48 rating puts it in line with some of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in its class. For instance, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> has an IP48 rating too. Newer non-foldable phones have a higher level of water resistance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IPX9 or IP69</a>, which tests specifically against high-temperature and high-pressure water jets going up to 1,450 PSI.</p><p>However, you won't miss this certification on the Motorola Razr 2025, as it doesn't add any depth or duration to a phone's water-resistance capabilities. The IP48 rating on the Razr 2025 means it'll handle rain, splashes, and most accidental drops with ease, and that's what matters.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Motorola's 2025 Razr series is officially here, months earlier than its predecessor's launch. It may seem odd to launch so early, as the 2024 Razr series has had less than a year to revel in its apparent success, but it seems Motorola is excited to get things rolling this year, and for good reason.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 series</a> marks a significant shift in Motorola's strategy, with the company launching three models this year instead of the usual two. Leading the trip is the top-end Razr Ultra 2025, which has specs that would make most standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phones</a> jealous, although all that power does indeed come at a price. Following are the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025, the latter of which I still lovingly refer to as the Razr "Minus."</p><p>I got some hands-on time with all of these devices, including new AI features and accessories, and I must say I'm quite impressed with what Motorola is doing with the Razr Ultra. That said, I'm a bit worried that one key aspect of the Razr Ultra may overshadow this impressive device.</p><p>Here are my initial impressions.</p>
<h2 id="more-razr-for-everyone-2">More Razr for everyone</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-17" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr Ultra 2025 was the primary focus of my attention during the hands-on, as it's the newest addition to the Razr family, which previously only consisted of the Razr and Razr Plus. However, despite its premium status over its siblings, the Ultra and Plus share much of the same design, and the hardware looks nearly identical.</p><p>The cover screen is the same size at 4 inches, and despite the display being .1 inches larger on the Ultra (thanks to smaller bezels), the difference seems negligible. Aside from the colors and materials, the primary way to distinguish them is the presence of a new AI Key to activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai" target="_blank">Moto AI</a> (more on that later).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since Motorola seems allergic to glass back panels these days, the Razr Ultra comes in some pretty exciting new colors and finishes, including an FSC-certified wood finish and Alcantara. This isn't Motorola's first wood phone, and hopefully it won't be the last, as it gives the phone a surprisingly light yet sturdy feel in hand.</p><p>This is, however, the first phone to feature Alcantara fabric, which is found on the likes of the Lucid Air, Louis Vuitton bags, and other high-end products. On the Razr Ultra, it not only looks great with the stitching along the back, but it feels incredibly soft to the touch.</p><p>The Razr Plus and Razr are admittedly less exciting, but they still offer some great color options. The Plus only features three colors, which are borrowed from its predecessor— a common theme with this phone. In contrast, the Razr 2025 introduces all-new hues, including a vibrant green and a pleasant pink.</p>

<p>Notable hardware changes include a new titanium hinge, which Motorola claims is four times stronger and should withstand more folds. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a> had a relatively flimsy hinge, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> marked a notable improvement. In my limited time with the device, the hinge didn't feel significantly different from the 2024 model, but I'll need more time with the Razr Ultra 2025 before I can provide a more informed comment.</p><p>IP48 water and dust resistance are also highlights, while the Ultra gets the new Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic for extra protection on the cover screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design surprisingly says a lot about the hardware in these phones. The Razr Ultra comes with bold new colors and finishes, which translate to impressive specs underneath. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> makes this the most powerful flip phone to date, while 16GB of RAM is enough to make even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> jealous.</p><p>Additionally, there's a new Pantone-validated Super HD display that looks fantastic; it's bright, responsive, and vibrant, with a crease that's somehow even less noticeable than its predecessor.</p><p>The Razr Ultra also has Pantone Validated cameras for better skin tone and color reproduction, and the 50MP dual camera system now has a secondary ultrawide sensor after last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025-needs-to-ditch-telephoto-camera">featured a fairly limiting 2x telephoto lens</a>.</p><p>Finally, the battery specs make a <em>huge</em> jump with a 4,700mAh capacity, 68W wired charging, and 30W wireless charging. I'm already pleased with the battery life on the Razr Plus 2024, so I'm really excited to see what the extra juice does with the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr Plus, like the design, gets probably the fewest changes of the trio. The same chip should prove adequate, but it would've been nice to see some sort of upgrade in this manner. Aside from the new hinge, IP48 certification, and Pantone-validated display and cameras, the core specs are largely the same as those of the Razr Plus 2024.</p><p>Even the Razr 2025 received more changes, featuring an upgraded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> and a larger 4,500mAh battery, along with the aforementioned improvements also found in the Razr Plus. We'll have to see how the phone performs with this new chip, but I had no issues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">previous Razr model</a> in terms of performance.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KGDWKs7V7KKizucEWBeYxc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-11" alt="Moto AI hub on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KGDWKs7V7KKizucEWBeYxc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is leaning heavily into AI, which is good to see, as it previously felt like the company was falling behind its competitors in this regard. Moto AI is now a fully fledged AI hub with features that feel genuinely interesting and helpful.</p><p>For example, Next Move is the result of user feedback from the initial Moto AI beta, as there were concerns that Motorola's features and use cases weren't clear. By evoking Moto AI whenever there's content on the screen, it can suggest various actions based on what's displayed, such as saving a recipe, generating an image, or creating a playlist. It can also recommend other Moto AI actions like Remember This or Pay Attention, making it easy to utilize Moto AI.</p>

<p>The new Image Studio is also an intriguing addition, providing users with a hub to generate images and wallpapers that utilize AI features, such as Sketch to Image, which was recently introduced on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-hands-on">Moto G Stylus 2025</a>.</p><p>Motorola is also making it easy to access Moto AI with the new AI Key on the Razr Ultra. As someone who dislikes it when companies try to force their AI assistance onto the power button, having a dedicated key is a welcome feature. There's some customization here, too, but it didn't feel as robust as I would've liked.</p><p>One feature that intrigued me was Look and Talk, which is as simple as it sounds. When the Razr Ultra is tented, you can just look at it and it will start listening to you, ready to respond to whatever query you may have. I wasn't able to try this myself, as the phone can only recognize one face. However, in the demonstrations I saw, it worked pretty well and feels like something I would love to see on a Pixel with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>.</p>

<p>Other Moto AI features received notable updates as well, but what shocked me was how Motorola appears to be gathering AI partners to help boost Moto AI. In addition to Gemini, there's now Meta’s Llama, Microsoft Copilot, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a>, the latter of which is pre-installed and optimized to some extent with Moto AI.</p><p>It really feels like Moto just wants to give users the choice of whatever AI model is best for certain tasks, and while I'll need time to test out how this all comes together in practice, it's something I can appreciate.</p>

<p>It wasn't just phones and AI; Motorola is also highlighting its accessories with new earbuds and a new smartwatch.</p><p>The Moto Buds Loop look quite stylish, especially with Swarovski in play on a blinged-out edition of the buds. I've recently come to appreciate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open ear earbuds</a>, and there's no doubt the Bose tuning should make these quite capable.</p>

<p>Finally, the Moto Watch Fit is an Apple Watch clone with a robust battery life and plenty of health monitoring options. It's also incredibly lightweight and durable, although it seems to be missing one big thing: Wear OS.</p><p>Android Central senior editor Michael Hicks recently wrote about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-doesnt-motorola-make-another-wear-os-watch">Motorola needs to return to Wear OS</a> following impressive launches from Samsung and OnePlus, so it's sad to go another year without a Moto 360 revival given the success of the Razr.</p>

<p>After seeing how much Motorola improved the Razr Plus 2024 over its predecessor, perhaps it shouldn't surprise me too much that the Razr Ultra is a major step up. Now that the Razr has found its footing in the market, Motorola appears serious about providing consumers with a premium experience by incorporating the best hardware and all the AI it can into its phones.</p><p>However, I'm concerned that the $1,299 price tag for the Ultra may deter consumers, and that the Razr Plus hasn't changed enough to justify its price. We'll have to see how things go as the year progresses; I just hope Motorola isn't shooting itself in the foot, because the Razr Ultra 2025 <em>feels</em> like such a good phone that you should want to buy. I know I do!</p>

I talked about how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56 is the worst mid-range phone</a> I used this year, and the Galaxy A36 is much the same — with the only difference being that the device is a smidgen more affordable. <br><br>There are other alternatives to consider; I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a>, and Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Phone 3a Pro</a> is a terrific choice. And there's now a new contender thanks to Infinix. I haven't covered the brand much over the years, but it's clear that the Transsion-owned phone manufacturer is intent on increasing its global presence, and it is rolling out pretty great phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o3cYCTXTsb84eMBs77NJRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o3cYCTXTsb84eMBs77NJRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Note 50 Pro+ made its debut last month, and the phone will go on sale globally for the equivalent of $370 — undercutting the Galaxy A36. That's not all though; with the Note 50 Pro+, Infinix managed to deliver one of the most feature-packed phones in this segment — the device gets a silicon-carbon battery, a 3x telephoto lens at the back, Dimensity 8350 platform, an AMOLED with 144Hz refresh, and an aluminum build.</p>
<h2 id="great-design-with-unique-extras-2">Great design with unique extras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NvYXQ59DnPqg3ruwh6GkRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvYXQ59DnPqg3ruwh6GkRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Clearly, Infinix is looking to make a statement with the Note 50 Pro+. The device has better hardware than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a>, and it's the best value you'll find in the budget category this year. I also like the design quite a bit; the phone has an octagonal camera housing made out of glass that sits on a metal island, and the design looks pretty distinctive. The build quality is among the best of any budget phone, with Infinix using an aluminum mid-frame — the Galaxy A36 uses a plastic chassis.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yxbMMUneXaG26Kc4hAgpWJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yxbMMUneXaG26Kc4hAgpWJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone around, the Note 50 Pro+ has a flat profile, and as it doesn't have beveled edges, it isn't quite as comfortable to hold and use the device as higher-end options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or even the Pixel 9a. That said, that's about the only drawback I noticed on the design side of things; the volume and power buttons are located in the ideal location, and the back has a smooth finish that prevents smudging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nupMr2YVE86t76w6etTsQJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nupMr2YVE86t76w6etTsQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the phone gets an optical module underneath the cameras, and this is used to measure heart rate and blood oxygen levels. It does a pretty good job in this regard; I tested it against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-best-hybrid-smartwatch">ScanWatch Nova</a>, and it was accurate.</p>
<h2 id="one-of-the-best-budget-hardware-packages-2">One of the best budget hardware packages</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Rf7ifXFpvJHLvACs7RuUXJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rf7ifXFpvJHLvACs7RuUXJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 6.78-inch AMOLED panel is quite decent, and while it doesn't get quite as bright as the POCO X7 Pro, it has good color vibrancy. What I like the most about the panel it that it has 144Hz refresh — there is a noticeable fluidity to the UI that's better than just about every other budget phone — and it gets 2,304Hz PWM dimming as standard. Samsung and Google don't use PWM dimming on their high-end phones (much less their budget devices), and this is an area where Chinese brands are absolutely dominating. <br><br>Like most Chinese manufacturers, Infinix doesn't allow gaming beyond 60fps, but this wasn't as big an issue as on a flagship. If anything, the Dimensity 8350 platform does a brilliant job at gaming, and the phone is among the best budget devices in this regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FB2fKX4vMr7qsPHfcZ4aRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FB2fKX4vMr7qsPHfcZ4aRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are other niceties; you get 12GB of RAM as standard, and the device comes with 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. It's refreshing to see brands switch to 256GB as base storage, and while Samsung and Google still haven't done so, this isn't an issue on most Chinese phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3FeZFWs8XXPY73VZsxMxVJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FeZFWs8XXPY73VZsxMxVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 5200mAh battery lasts all day without any issues whatsoever, and it uses silicon-carbon tech to increase density. It takes just over 40 minutes to charge the phone thanks to 100W charging tech, and I didn't run into any issues in this area. And yes, there is a charger bundled in the package; Infinix has a generous accessory bundle as well, and that's good to see in 2025. <br><br>That said, the 5200mAh battery is on the lower end of the scale as these things go — the X7 Pro gets a 6500mAh unit in India — so the Note 50 Pro+ doesn't quite measure up to its immediate rivals. That said, it is better than the Galaxy A36, and even the A56.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3U4ZPgF8oscChwyedyaQJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3U4ZPgF8oscChwyedyaQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera is clearly the star of the show on the Note 50 Pro+, with the device featuring a 50MP main camera alongside a 50MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The latter is a novel enough addition in this segment that its inclusion immediately gives the Note 50 Pro+ an advantage, and it utilizes the sensor to good effect. There's also an 8MP wide-angle lens, but it is strictly average. <br><br>You get great photos in daylight, and while there are a few inconsistencies in the image quality at night, the phone has one of the best camera packages in this category. The versatility is refreshing to see, and the 3x sensor makes a noticeable difference in daily use. I used that sensor much more than the wide-angle lens, and it's good to see a budget phone getting the module.</p>
<h2 id="a-great-value-all-around-2">A great value all around</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Z3Xfffjuw7pftS8Y5bpmRJ" name="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus" alt="Infinix Note 50 Pro Plus against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z3Xfffjuw7pftS8Y5bpmRJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the software. The Note 50 Pro+ runs XOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and the interface is quite similar to what you get on Xiaomi's phones. There's a split notification pane, app drawer that automatically sorts apps, a global search mode, and good amount of customizability. <br><br>While I noticed some bloatware on the device, it was easy enough to uninstall, and the interface itself looks clean — it has a cohesive design. In fact, the only annoyance is that the phone will get just two platform updates; that's just not adequate in 2025, and Infinix needs to do better. <br><br>Other than that, the Note 50 Pro+ turned out to be a much better device than I imagined. It has a terrific hardware package and the most versatile set of cameras in this category, and it nails the basics. The best part is the affordability; it doesn't cost as much as the A36, and that makes it a standout deal.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly bringing its Galaxy Unpacked event back to NYC this July, shaking up its usual timeline.</li><li>If the report is right, it’ll be the first time in nearly three years that NYC hosts the foldable launch since the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4 in 2022.</li><li>Mass production of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 presumably kicks off in May, signaling a fast track to their July debut.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh report from South Korea says Samsung is gearing up to bring its summer Galaxy Unpacked event back to New York this July.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25330940" target="_blank">The JoongAng Daily</a>, instead of sticking to its usual timeline, Samsung is reportedly moving its Galaxy Unpacked event up, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> expected to make their debut in the early weeks of July.</p><p>If the report is accurate, it will mark a pretty big shift from Samsung's usual summer playbook. It’d also be the first time in about three years that NYC hosts the foldable spotlight again, with the last one being back in August 2022 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 and Flip 4.</p><p>Last year, Samsung unveiled its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> in Paris on July 10. That said, even with that in the rearview, the exact date for this year’s big reveal is still up in the air.</p>

<p>An earlier report from South Korea’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202504162329253040101110&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00" target="_blank">The Bell</a> claims Samsung is kicking off mass production of its upcoming foldables in May. The scoop supposedly comes from Samsung Display, the folks behind the screens. If that timeline holds, it’s a solid sign things are ramping up for the next-gen foldables to hit shelves soon.</p><p>The rumored May start for mass production lines up pretty well with the buzz about a July launch. The original article hints at a foldable launch in the “latter half of the year” (machine translation). So, it's safe to bet Samsung is rolling up its sleeves for another big Galaxy Unpacked to mark the occasion.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades-incoming-2">Upgrades incoming</h2>
<p>The rumors around the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 point to a solid step up from the Fold 6 and Flip 6. Previous reports hint at some meaningful upgrades and polished refinements across the board.</p><p>Considering the trends in tech, it’d be pretty wild if the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 didn’t roll out with the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Furthermore, the Z Fold 7 is likely getting a camera boost and a thinner look.</p><p>Along with the foldables, the July event should also bring a new Galaxy Watch, Samsung's Android XR headset, and some early looks at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">Galaxy Z Flip FE</a> and the rumored “tri-fold” device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's Workspace feature drop for April 2025 is here with new AI tools for Gemini, Gmail, Slides, and Chat, the company announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/april-workspace-feature-drop-new-ai-features-across-gemini-chat-gmail-and-slides" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>These updates notably bring popular features from NotebookLM, an AI-powered notebook and studying tool, to the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini </a>app. Integrating with existing features like Deep Research, the upgrades effectively bring the NotebookLM experience to more people.</p><p>The rest of the handy new Workspace features help with everything from adding events to your Google Calendar to creating unique presentations with Google Slides. Let's dive in and review everything new added to Google Workspace this month.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-is-getting-a-few-excellent-notebooklm-tools-2">Gemini is getting a few excellent NotebookLM tools</h2>
<p>The list of Gemini upgrades added in April starts with Canvas, a new workspace accessible from the main Gemini app. Here, users can draft documents, generate code, and much more. Below the Gemini prompt bar, you will now find the <strong>Canvas</strong> button beside the <strong>Deep Research</strong> button. Selecting it will start a writing or coding project that can be created, refined, and eventually exported to Google Docs or elsewhere.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="iQ3B5nMmbb6jUVkiQa9LEJ" name="April_workspace_drop_first_image.max-1000x1000" alt="Google Workspace features added in the April 2025 feature drop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQ3B5nMmbb6jUVkiQa9LEJ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It sounds a bit like NotebookLM, but more conveniently accessible from the regular Gemini user-interface. Similarly, Google is similarly bringing Audio Overviews from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM </a>to the main Gemini app. For those unfamiliar, Audio Overviews take uploaded documents, slides, and more and turn them into spoken audio tracks that resemble the experience of listening to a podcast.</p><p>Audio Overviews in Gemini integrate with other features, like Canvas and Deep Research. For example, Google says a Deep Research report can be quickly turned into an Audio Overview. These features were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-new-features-canvas-audio-overviews">previously announced in March</a>, and are now widely available.</p><p>The same goes for Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental), which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">widely available for free Gemini users</a>, as announced on March 31.</p>
<h2 id="gemini-in-gmail-will-automatically-find-appointments-buried-in-your-emails-2">Gemini in Gmail will automatically find appointments buried in your emails</h2>
<p>Next up is a handy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail </a>feature that will spot invites to on-site events in your inbox and prompt you to add the event to your calendar. This was already possible for shared Google Calendar or Google Meet invites, but this new Gmail tool works with written invites that have no connection to the Google ecosystem.</p><p>It's powered by Gemini, and can detect written details about events in emails you've received. Then, in the Gemini sidebar for Gmail, you'll seen an <strong>Add to Calendar</strong> button that'll automatically create a Calendar event based on the information.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="pkFAatfCvWGMqdVeQ26qJJ" name="Acme_site_pic_.max-1600x1600" alt="Gmail detecting calendar invites with Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pkFAatfCvWGMqdVeQ26qJJ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="960" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, Gmail is getting Gemini-powered Contextual Smart Replies that suggests context-accurate responses that can be sent with a tap or a few. These are available on both desktop and mobile.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-now-easier-to-build-presentations-in-google-slides-2">It's now easier to build presentations in Google Slides</h2>
<p>Sidebars are becoming a mainstay of Google Workspace, and there's a new one specifically made for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/updates-for-docs-sheets-and-slides-app-on-android-tablets">Slides</a>. This design sidebar can be used to find templates, add building blocks, discover stock photos, or generate images with AI. It's neatly pushed to the side of the slide you're working on as to not block your view.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.81%;"><img id="DseUkhNXhhGNQMmymWc6jQ" name="Under_10_MB_Q225_Slides_Templates_GIF" alt="Google Workspace features added in the April 2025 feature drop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DseUkhNXhhGNQMmymWc6jQ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1115" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"This convenient sidebar consolidates features to build and present visually stunning slides — without leaving your presentation," the company explains.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else-that-s-new-and-when-the-features-will-be-available-2">Everything else that's new, and when the features will be available</h2>
<p>For enterprises, Google is adding a board tab in Chat that will let teams pin messages, files, and links. Additionally, it's adding a HubSpot app for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-developing-announcements-feature">Google Chat</a> that integrates with the customer resource management platform for convenient access.</p><p>Many of these features were previously announced on the Google Workspace Blog, but are now becoming widely available as of the Workspace feature drop for April 2025.</p>

<p>But while traveling with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> or other laptop usually means you have to forego some of the productivity a multi-monitor home or office setup provides, portable monitors will help fix that problem.</p><p>That's because monitor tech has come a very long way over the years, and while you won't be carrying around a massive 36-inch ultrawide monitor in your carry-on bag, you could pack in two specialized monitors that are built for on-the-go productivity. I've tried monitors from brands like KYY and Jsaux, plus some non-traditional solutions from companies like Xreal and others that you absolutely must see!</p>
<h2 id="one-monitor-please-2">One monitor, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sd2nAR8WZd29iVViLjpoK4" name="KYY-portable-monitor-01" alt="A KYY portable montior hooked up to a laptop via a USB-C connection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sd2nAR8WZd29iVViLjpoK4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Realistically, if you're packing a Chromebook, you're probably trying to keep things light. The KYY K3 Portable Monitor 15.6'' is the right choice in this case, as it can usually be found for around $80 or less and comes in an incredibly elegant package. The monitor itself looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> because it comes with a preinstalled triangular folding folio case.</p><p>This case includes a hard backing that protects the monitor when it's in a bag and you'd have a hard time telling the difference between it and a tablet. As with a tablet, you fold it back into a triangle to prop the monitor up on any table or desk, and a single USB-C connection to your laptop delivers power, video, and audio. It's literally as simple as it gets, and it barely takes up any space in a bag because it's so thin.</p><p>If I had to pick any one solution, it would be this just because it's not only easy to carry but it's also easy on the eyes. The 1080p LCD panel is bright and vibrant, doesn't use PWM dimming, and really just looks great. It's not just the most affordable solution on this list but it also sort of proves that simple is best, especially when you're on the go. I brought this one to my mom's back at Christmas time (hence, the decor) and have used it on several occasions since.</p>

<h2 id="portable-dual-monitors-2">Portable dual monitors</h2>

<p>It might sound ridiculous, but two companies make excellent portable dual monitor solutions that'll deliver maximum productivity even in a small coffee shop. My favorite is the KYY X90 Laptop Screen Extender, which is a portable dual-monitor setup that you can use either to full capacity — shown above — or in one of a few different, less head-turning configurations.</p><p>The monitor comes in a single, folding package that includes a fully movable kickstand. The kickstand and monitors can be unfolded to nearly any angle and hold their place, letting you fully customize the angle of the monitors, as well as the angle of the stand. It's got two USB-C ports, one for charging and the other for display out, and the included short braided USB-C cable makes it convenient to use on a table without getting cords everywhere.</p><p>But my favorite thing about this setup is that it's not only portable — there's a built-in handle that makes it easy to carry around — but that you can fold the second monitor in and just use this as a one-monitor setup. That makes it super versatile, especially since you can tent the second monitor and make the whole thing a tall vertical monitor setup.</p>

<p>It's also made of aluminum, so it feels solidly put together and can withstand a reasonable drop without shattering. It's fairly heavy for a monitor, but not something that would feel uncomfortable in a backpack alongside your laptop. Be aware that it is a bit on the thick side since it's got a metal mid-section plus the two monitors that swivel out, so carrying it in your backpack with your laptop is going to feel like carrying four laptops.</p><p>The display quality is pretty reasonable, with 60Hz LCD panels that have a good range of brightness. While these won't win any awards for their visual quality, they're not bad at all and, on the bright side, won't hurt your eyes since they don't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. Also, since they just connect to your laptop via a single USB-C cable, you don't need to worry about a secondary power cable or something like that, but they'll definitely pull your battery life down quite a bit.</p><p>As you can tell from the photos, this setup takes up a decent amount of space. There's no chance you'd ever get any extended monitor solution on a plane but this one might have trouble even on small cafe tables. If nothing, this is a great solution for working from a hotel room or a dining room table.</p>

<p>The second, more premium but less portable solution is the Jsaux FlipGo, pictured on the right in the image above. It's a pair of 16-inch <em>touchscreen</em> monitors that stack vertically instead of being positioned horizontally like the KYY monitors are. This makes it easier to position on a smaller table since it takes up space vertically.</p><p>The vertical alignment also means that the topmost monitor will be more comfortable on your neck than the rest of the setup or your laptop since you won't have to look down at all to see it.</p><p>Brady Snyder has been testing this unit for Android Central and told me, "after using this, I honestly don't think I could ever use those laptop-mounted displays." Like the KYY setup above, the Jsaux one connects to your laptop via a single USB-C cable that carries both video and power.</p>

<p>Brady told me, "there are desk stands like I pictured, and also folio stands for when you're out and about," so there's quite a bit of versatility with this setup. The monitor folds into a clamshell that's "kind of a laptop size, but a bit thicker," Brady said. "It looks cool connected to my Yoga Book 9i (which already has two screens), but it also works with any old laptop or desktop."</p><p>What's also cool is that this doesn't have to run as two individual monitors. Brady said that it can be run as one giant monitor if you wish, making it feel more like a tall canvas or even a giant foldable phone if you tent it like a laptop (pictured above).</p><p>The biggest downsides to this unit are its price — it's more than twice as much as the KYY dual monitor setup — and the bulkiness factor. Jsaux didn't make it one cohesive unit like KYY did, so you have to attach a cable between the two monitors and store it in "a clunky briefcase."</p>

<p>It's likely you've heard that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> offer a "personal monitor on your face" anywhere you go. It's true, and my favorite pick for this solution is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>. These glasses plug into the USB-C port of your laptop, phone, or even consoles like the Steam Deck, then project a giant screen that conveniently rests on your face.</p><p>These glasses weigh 84 grams and feature super comfortable nose pads and a glasses arm design you can wear for hours without discomfort. They also feature the first-ever custom silicon inside a pair of smart glasses, enabling what's called 3DoF — that's 3 Degrees of Freedom — movement. In short, this means that the virtual monitor is "anchored" in place like a traditional monitor, even though it doesn't actually exist in physical space.</p><p>Some other smart glasses have offered this with special software you have to install, but Xreal One does it automatically with no additional software or configuration. You put them on and they <em>just work</em>. It's as effortless as the single monitor solution above and offers the best image quality thanks to the micro OLED displays behind the lenses, but they'll cost you almost as much as the dual touch screen monitors from Jsaux above.</p><p>Plus, since these glasses are light and the virtual monitor doesn't take up any physical space at all, you can even enjoy a giant 200-inch screen while sitting in a cramped airplane seat.</p>

<h2 id="a-solution-for-everyone-2">A solution for everyone</h2>

<p>I prefer smart glasses for many scenarios, as they're the simplest to set up and offer a giant monitor without needing the physical space. But there's something about having a physical monitor that's irreplaceable in some situations.</p><p>For that, the space-saving nature of the KYY single monitor setup is quite ideal, as its tablet-like form factor and simple USB-C connection also make it easy to get connected without hassle, lots of cables, or even hunting for an outlet. This makes the most sense to carry around with a portable Chromebook like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> which works perfectly with all the monitors and smart glasses you see here.</p><p>Portable computing solutions have come a long way in the past few years alone, with different configurations that'll fit any budget or lifestyle. From powerful dual monitor solutions to simple, affordable single monitors, or even advanced smart glasses that give you a massive screen anywhere you sit, pick something from this short list and I'm confident you'll be happy.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few years, I've become increasingly concerned about eye health and how much time I spend on my digital devices. My colleague, Namerah, recently published an editorial about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">minimalist phones are the dumbphones of the modern era</a>, and it made me realize that E Ink phones seemed like the perfect solution for me.</p><p>So I did what any tech journalist would do: I reached out to the companies responsible for the trend so I could try one myself. I ended up with two in the same week, and while both devices share an E Ink screen and a chunkier design in common, the philosophies behind each device couldn't be more different.</p><p>And while the Mudita Kompakt and the Minimal Phone clearly have different ideas of what defines a "minimalist phone," the goal is largely the same: to cure you of your digital addiction. As Namerah Saud Fatmi said in her article, "None of these minimalist devices have colored displays, making them non-intrusive and less distracting."</p><p>But even if a minimalist phone is right for you, it's not a change you're going to be able to do cold turkey in one day. It's been (unsurprisingly) difficult to switch to a less capable phone, but that pain may ultimately cultivate something better in my life over time.</p>

<p>I'm not reviewing these phones just yet — that'll happen when I've had more than two days with each — but I do want to talk about my first two days with each device. Most modern phones are designed to be "glass and metal sandwiches," as we so often refer to them at Android Central. Both the Mudita Kompakt and the Minimal Phone have a very different vision of what phone hardware should look like, but they both seem to agree on two things: metal and glass don't make for a good pocket device.</p><p>Both phones sport a distinctly plastic body and a non-glass display cover, so there's little likelihood that either phone will break or shatter if you happen to drop them. I'm not sure I'm ready to call either design the next Nokia 3310, but each harkens back to a time when tiny bezels and Gorilla Glass weren't common phone traits.</p>

<p>The Minimal Phone looks and feels like a less premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-keyone">BlackBerry KEYone</a>, and that's very much by design. Not only does it help keep the price down, but it also keeps you from wanting to behold its elegance and beauty throughout the day as you swipe through TikToks. The physical keyboard has a nice click to the keys but it's nowhere near as ergonomic or, again, elegant as BlackBerry's highly engineered designs.</p><p>And, if you do happen to pick up a Minimal Phone this year, avoid getting the black color. This thing is a fingerprint magnet and a half, and it's weirdly difficult to wipe them off.</p><p>Minimal is using a fairly standard version of Android 14 with the January 2025 security patch. This means all your favorite apps can be installed on the phone, but don't expect to be able to use everything the way you're used to. The screen simply doesn't allow for that, and it's funny how difficult it is to look at even a photo when it's in papery black and white.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7zF7AuJyCbQ7Z8PJc2zZZk" name="mudita-kompakt-minimal-phone-01" alt="The white Mudita Kompakt next to the black Minimal Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zF7AuJyCbQ7Z8PJc2zZZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Between the two, I far prefer the Mudita Kompakt's design. It's got a very 2000s MP3 player aesthetic with its thick plastic frame and lovely rounded corners all around. This thing feels <em>great</em> to hold, and it's diminutive size ensures that it fits in everyone's hands without feeling tiny. I was also impressed with the touch response on the phone, as some ePaper displays (like older Kindles) feel incredibly sluggish.</p><p>Mudita's OS is built on Android, but it's been stripped of <em>all</em> Google services, meaning you won't be checking your Google Calendar or tapping into Google Play Games. You can pretty easily sideload the Aurora app store and install many popular Android apps, but any that require Google services simply won't work.</p>

<p>Both devices feature an older type of E Ink display that's more commonly found on a Kindle rather than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best E Ink tablets</a>. The Mudita Kompakt's screen is actually a bit better than the Minimal Phone's display so far in my usage, meaning you'll see less flashing/refreshing on Mudita's phone.</p><p>But don't go into this expecting to play games or even watch some videos on it, as you can with e-readers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a>, which feature E Ink Carta displays. Those devices are probably easier as transition devices because the refresh rate is much closer to that of an LCD or OLED panel, while these two minimalist phones are strictly designed for more static imagery.</p><p>Here's a quick video I put together showing how each looks while scrolling, so you can get a good idea.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lYOzNwUiJwE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>All of these things add up to a <em>very</em> different experience from your average Android smartphone, and, quite frankly, it's been really hard making the transition. In some ways, I'll never be able to fully disconnect because of my job. I rely on Google services each and every day, and it's simply impossible for me to unplug from them and continue doing what I do.</p><p>But I can see the sparks of change happening slowly as I get more and more adjusted to this new lifestyle. Scrolling through social media is basically impossible on these, and it means that the only time I'll be X'ing or Instagramming is when I'm at my desk doing actual work instead of wasting time on the couch.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If you pick one up, give yourself some grace. It's a huge change, and it's going to take time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And while I'd already dropped my T-Mobile SIM card into the Minimal Phone two days ago to get the full experience, I've still got my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> in my other pocket to ensure that I can get a great picture or video when the moment happens. Both phones have cameras on the back and can perform basic photography/videography, but I'm a photo snob and can't give up the modern smartphone camera.</p><p>I'd never encourage an addict to keep their temptation in their back pocket at all times, but, for now, this is the best way that I can think of to transition to a more minimalist lifestyle over time. Going cold turkey can sometimes be best, but I'm happy taking it slow and seeing where this gets me over time. If you pick one up, give yourself some grace. It's a huge change, and it's going to take time.</p>

However, some companies, such as Anbernic, are halting shipments to the U.S. entirely.</p><p>Just last week, Retroid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/order-a-retroid-pocket-mini-weve-got-bad-news" target="_blank">announced</a> that despite its best efforts, those in the U.S. who pre-ordered the Pocket Classic in Kiwi, Teal, or Berry would have to either pick a different color or cancel their orders entirely. This is due to an imposed deadline of April 25, at which point "shipping agencies will not accept U.S.-bound packages from China."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.30%;"><img id="KZifQ2ZmtsKgRpJe3meWS9" name="ayn-shipping-response-email" alt="Shipping update from AYN support" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZifQ2ZmtsKgRpJe3meWS9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1080" height="1040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN Discord)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This was just the first domino to fall, as Anbernic has recently updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/pages/shipping-policy" target="_blank">Shipping Policy</a> landing page. There's a notice at the top of the page that says, "Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today. We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse."</p><p>A message recently shared on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/channels/1014777854384414762/1328472903242743929/1363846038041006090">AYN Discord channel</a> seemingly confirmed that it, too, will be making changes. The company will continue shipping orders until April 25, "then pause for a week and try to choose a new channel for shipping after May 5th." Currently, AYN offers either DHL or 4PX for shipping, with the customer being able to choose during the checkout process.</p>

<p>Taking a breather and going back to the drawing board seems to be the most logical move. It's something we saw Nintendo do in regards to the Switch 2 launch, after the company delayed pre-orders in the U.S. As a result, many began worrying whether the Switch 2, which is made in Vietnam, would end up being priced even higher than the $449 retail price.</p><p>Ultimately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-maintains-nintendo-switch-2-pricing-retail-pre-orders-to-begin-april-24-in-u-s/?srsltid=AfmBOoqXGmvaw53mzUe6MymybEDpdqOGoLvnVrGH3rkxz0vU5o5Y9ndy">Nintendo decided</a> against raising the price of the Switch 2 itself, but confirmed that "Switch 2 accessories will see price adjustments." However, there's still a chance that the Switch 2 will eventually cost more, depending on how much inventory Nintendo has on hand in its U.S. warehouses.</p>

<p>Anbernic's decision to suspend shipments to the U.S. comes at an interesting time, as the company only just recently announced its latest gaming handheld, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/blogs/news/anbernic-rg557-first-look">RG557</a>. However, pre-orders for the device haven't even opened yet, and we're interested to see how things will play out.</p><p>The company has warehouses in both China and the U.S., but given how quickly the tariff situation has developed, we're not sure what inventory levels might look like. Although it's unlikely, there's even a chance that Anbernic wasn't able to get any inventory into the States.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-5" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE Retro Power hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4999" height="2812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there are AYANEO and OneXSugar, two companies that announced devices earlier this year but have yet to provide any availability updates. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">AYANEO's Pocket ACE</a> looks to be one of the most pocketable and powerful handhelds we've ever seen, utilizing the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 and sporting a 4.5-inch display.</p><p>OneXSugar's Sugar1 is set to be one of the first devices to be powered by the new Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">announced at GDC 2025</a>. While flagship power is great, the real story is the dual-screen design, essentially offering a modern (and futuristic) take on the Nintendo DS.</p><p>While we're excited to see both of these gaming handhelds launched, we're also expecting to be disappointed. It wouldn't come as a shock if neither of these ended up arriving in the U.S. If they do, I suspect that we're in store for some rather high price tags.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6-1" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, this entire situation is out of our hands, meaning we're just at the mercy of OEMs, shipping partners, and retailers. It also means that even if you are (or were) willing to pay the tariffs, you might end up finding an order being canceled just because you live in the U.S.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the deadline, companies have been trying to bring as much inventory into the U.S. as they can. So it's likely that we'll see a bit of a buffer between now and when the inventory runs out. After that, all bets are off, and we simply won't know what the landscape of things will look like until the time has arrived.</p><p>Some OEMs and retailers, such as Anbernic and AliExpress, have U.S. warehouses that you can order from. Besides that, Amazon resellers are probably your next best bet. But no matter what, be prepared to pay more than what the original retail price was.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's annual I/O event is a little under one month away, and the company has posted information that teases what's coming.</p><p>As usual, Google has posted its sessions list for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore">scheduled conferences</a> ahead of its I/O 2025 event. One of the standout categories is Android, which the company states will hold a presentation about Material 3 Expressive, Android's "next-level" UX design. Google's brief overview explains the session will highlight its "new emotional design."</p><p>The sessions will also grant developers the design files and alpha code so they can begin preparing their apps to work with it.</p><p>Another major aspect to be talked about is "desktop windowing and stylus support." The former will be showcased as a way to help users "manage multiple tasks," while the Ink API assists with better stylus support on Android.</p><p>Google is also preparing a major announcement regarding its XR experience. Its sessions list states interested parties can learn more about Android XR, alongside information about its SDK Developer Preview evolving into a Beta during the event. Additionally, it seems Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-22">will inform users</a> about the "public launch" of Android XR later this year.</p>
<h2 id="google-i-o-2025-2">Google I/O 2025</h2>

<p>Users can check out Google's entire planned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore">sessions list for I/O 2025</a> on its official website. There are plans to dive deeper into its AI, Web, and Cloud features for interested users. Google will offer insights into its latest Gemini model advancements and where it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/pa-keynote-18">might head next</a> with its AI software. It will then discuss the new built-in AI APIs on their way to Chrome to help with summarizing and writing content.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">date was official</a> for Google I/O 2025 after fans solved the company's typically expected puzzle. The show will kick off on May 20 through May 21, packed with keynote streams, sessions, and more. Google says it will host demos, networking opportunities, and workshops alongside the conferences we've become accustomed to.</p><p>Devs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/">can register</a> to ensure they remain in the loop until the event kicks off in May.</p><p>There's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">quite a bit we're expecting</a> from I/O 2025, like Android 16. After confirming during MWC 2025 that Android 16 would launch earlier, Google has been busy crafting its betas for testers and developers to refine the product before it arrives. The company is seemingly still on track to rollout the software sometime in June to meet its Q2 2025 target.</p><p>Moreover, as we've seen in its sessions list, Android XR is still a hot topic. There's a chance we could learn more about it during its major keynote speech on May 20. The company recently had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">a TED 2025 demo</a> with Android XR-ready smart glasses. We were given a glimpse its the AI's (Gemini) "memory" capabilities to help users in their daily lives.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors now claim Samsung is not only working on One UI 8, but also an "8.5" update.</li><li>This version could bring large improvements to its next flagship trio in 2026.</li><li>Other rumors say One UI 8 (Android 16) might offer several foldable-focused updates for the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 this summer.</li><li>Samsung allegedly started testing One UI 8 earlier in March; however, rumors are not in sync about when users could see it launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors suggest Samsung is not only looking ahead to its next major OS update, but it could come with even more substantial elements later on.</p><p>The latest "exclusive" rumors stem from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammypolice.com/exclusive-galaxy-s26-series-to-come-with-one-ui-8-5-samsung-ditches-one-ui-8-1-110/">SammyPolice</a> post, which alleges what Samsung could do with One UI 8 and a potential 8.5 patch (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung-one-ui-8-5-in-progress/">Digital Trends</a>). For the former, the publication claims Samsung's One UI 8 upgrade could debut on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 come launch this summer. While the software has previously been rumored to arrive "earlier than expected," the post adds there's an underlying focus on foldables.</p><p>Supposedly, One UI 8 will deliver multitasking "optimizations" for foldables and "redesigned" widgets.</p><p>This is also the first time we're hearing of a suspected "One UI 8.5," but the publication claims its evidence is solid. It states that after analyzing "Samsung's system components," it came across a reference to One UI 8.5 alongside the base iteration.</p><p>Speculation says One UI 8.5 could bring a more notable upgrade for Samsung's devices as it seemingly forgoes any potential "8.1" or "8.1.1" updates. If true, this would be a return to a software release unseen since One UI 2.5 in 2020/2021.</p>

<p>Aside from the massive One UI 7 delays we've been subjected to, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">rumors of One UI 8's</a> surprise appearance started in early March. It was theorized that Samsung could skip any potential One UI 7 (minor) updates, like a 7.1 patch, and jump right into its next major iteration. These rumors were reportedly bolstered later that month when evidence of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">Samsung's internal testing</a> was found.</p><p>Evidence for that discovery was a Galaxy S25 running the supposed next major release. It showed up on Geekbench, and its software showed Android 16, which makes sense considering the rumors speak of One UI 8.</p><p>It seems that Samsung is attempting to fast-track its next One UI update on account of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Google doing the same</a>. The software achieved its "Platform Stability" milestone in mid-March, and two days ago, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">dropped Beta 4</a>. Google is sticking to its planned Q2 2025 release window, meaning we'll have between April and June for it to drop. However, signs seemingly point toward June, so we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>When it comes to One UI 8, the current line of rumors suggests we might see it on the next 2025 foldables. That points us toward July and August at the latest. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">some rumors</a> think an "early fall" launch could suit it. Take these rumors with a grain of salt for now.</p>

<p>Wherever you live, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> will get a significant boost in smarts this week. And Meta is also tempting new customers with a stylish new set of Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray frames, while expanding to a few new countries.</p><p>Starting in the United States and Canada, you'll be able to say, "Hey Meta, start Live AI," and have the Meta AI "see what you see continuously and converse with you more naturally," similar to Gemini Live except that you get hands-free insights into what you're doing.</p><p>Live AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">rolled out to Early Access</a> last December, but is "coming soon" for general availability, suggesting Meta thinks it's ready for widespread use. Meta suggests you try use cases like asking for help on recipe steps while you cook or holding an in-depth conversation about a landmark, without needing to ask "Hey Meta" before every question.</p>

<p>Live Translation is also leaving Early Access, so all Ray-Ban users will be able to hold inter-language conversations between English, French, Italian, and Spanish by saying "Hey Meta, start live translation." This should be available with the latest update.</p><p>You can currently send messages or call folks via Messenger or WhatsApp on your smart glasses; now, Meta is adding Instagram to the list with the same messaging and audio/ video calling capabilities.</p>
<p>Outside of North America, many European users don't have access to key Meta AI smarts, but that's about to change. Meta says that next week, EU users will be able to ask Meta AI about what they're looking at and get contextual responses. They won't have access to the new Live AI tools, however.</p><p>Last week, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-natural-ai-app-expansion-update">rolled out an update</a> that gave EU users access to music streaming apps like Spotify and Apple Music, as well as new voices designed to be "more natural and lifelike." Now, Meta will let EU users ask about what music they're currently listening to — though only if English is your default language.</p><p>Meta is expanding Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses sales to India, Mexico, and the United Arab Emirates. This should bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/4961066940605960/">total number of supported countries to 18</a>.</p>

<p>Prospective Ray-Ban Meta buyers have new styles and lens color combos to choose from today. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/skyler-shiny-chalky-gray-sapphire-transitions">Skyler Shiny Chalky Gray glasses</a> have a unique style and Transitions lenses so they can work indoors for people with a prescription.</p><p>If you prefer something a little less flashy, the Skyler Shiny Black frames now come with G15 Green or clear lenses for the first time. And there are many other Headliner and Wayfarer frames available, too.</p><p>All Ray-Ban Meta glasses have a 12MP camera, 32GB of storage for photos and videos, built-in mics and speakers, and hours of battery life. We suspect that Meta will release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley smart glasses</a> soon with the same smarts but a new style, escalating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-war-between-apple-meta-and-google-should-be-fun">smart glasses war</a> with other brands.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung and LG have joined the bandwagon in suing/arguing India's new "floor pricing" policy for companies looking to recycle e-waste.</li><li>Court documents show India wants to introduce a "minimum payment" of 22 rupees (~25 cents U.S.) per kilogram.</li><li>Samsung states this change would be roughly "5-15 times the price currently paid."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is reportedly drawing attention to a policy change overseas regarding a wide range of e-waste.</p><p>Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/lg-samsung-sue-indian-government-over-electronic-waste-pricing-policy-2025-04-21/">Reuters</a> states Samsung is joined by LG are suing/arguing India's newly refined pricing policy behind big companies attempting to recycle their technology (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-sues-indian-government-over-e-waste-policy-mandating-higher-payments/">SamMobile</a>). India is reportedly demanding "higher payouts" for companies looking to take care of e-waste responsibly.</p><p>For India's reasoning, the publication cites a statement from its court filings (not public), which says, "only 43% of the country's e-waste last year was recycled and at least 80% of the sector comprises informal scrap dealers." To rectify this, New Delhi proposes a "minimum payment" of 22 rupees (~25 cents U.S.) per kilogram to recycle consumer appliance waste.</p><p>This is what the country is calling a "fixed floor payment;" however, tech companies like Samsung and LG argue that this will benefit the recyclers more than solving the true issue.</p><p>While Samsung reportedly stated the proposed pricing plan was "5-15 times the price currently paid," others suggest India's pricing change could "triple" expenses for recycling e-waste. Meanwhile, the publication cites an LG statement that says "fleecing companies and taxing them" won't help India achieve its goal.</p>

<p>E-waste is a hot topic for companies in places all over the world, especially where the market is huge. Take the EU, for example, which mandated that all smartphone batteries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/eu-mandates-replaceable-batteries-2027">should be removable/replaceable</a> by the consumer by 2027. The European Council adopted a new rule across the region in mid-2023, stating OEMs must shift toward this new mentality to improve the amount of battery waste.</p><p>The region also ruled that producers should seek to collect 63% of portable battery waste by 2027. Moreover, the collection of lithium portable battery waste should hit 80% by 2031.</p><p>Of course, consumers can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-where-can-i-recycle-my-phone">do their part to recycle their old devices</a> or ones that may have broken. More often than not, folks in the U.S. can take their rundown devices to stores like Best Buy or Home Depot and have them recycle the items appropriately. It's worth noting that not everyone will have the same options available, so you might have to do a little research.</p><p>A rule of thumb would be to ask any place that sells devices about potential recycling spots.</p>

You also get 8GB of RAM, some pretty decent cameras, and all of the latest Galaxy AI features. </p><p>The only problem is that the phone now faces some stiff competition in the form of devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. So which of these midrange beauties is the best choice?</p>

<p>Starting at $499.99, Google&apos;s latest midrange masterpiece boasts better battery life than the S24 FE — and it ships with Android 15 — but the "Fan Edition" Samsung device is otherwise a better and more powerful phone. Without any discounts, choosing between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe">S24 FE vs the Pixel 9a</a> would be a pretty tough decision, but thanks to this price drop, the S24 FE is a no-brainer.</p><p>Things get a little more complicated when you compare the S24 FE with the OnePlus 13R, however, namely because the latter phone features a better display, battery life, and 256GB of base storage. It&apos;s also not too difficult to find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p"><strong>a deal that knocks the OnePlus 13R to $499.99</strong></a>. With that being said, I still give the Galaxy S24 FE the edge, but that&apos;s only because the Samsung phone gives you seven years of OS and security upgrades straight out of the box, which means you could be enjoying the "Fan Edition" experience for many years to come.</p>

<p>Samsung has again resumed the much-awaited One UI 7 stable release after putting a halt early last week. Although the company resumed by the end of the same week, more devices and older Galaxy handsets across regions are finally seeing the update.</p><p>While the Galaxy S25 series already shipped with One UI 7 and also received the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">April update</a>, the predecessors were long overdue in getting the update. The company started rolling out the update early this month, with multiple delays, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">pausing the update</a> for a while, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-rollout-continues-new-build">resuming it again</a>.</p>

<p>During the course, however, some regions like India and Germany haven't seen the update hit the Galaxy S24 series. And thankfully, this time, Galaxy S24 Ultra in India (including my handset) has finally seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> stable update today (Apr 23). It is a sizable 5.4GB update and it further includes the April security patch as well.</p><p>Not just India, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> users in Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Pakistan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, and more have started getting the update, per subreddits spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-resumes-one-ui-7-rollout-3547123/">Android Authority</a>. Further, several Galaxy S24 users on Reddit and Samsung Community have also confirmed the stable release, including handset owners on T-Mobile and Boost Mobile carriers.</p>

<p>Samsung has been working with marine researchers across three regions, helping them restore and study coral reefs for the past year, as a part of its initiative "Coral in Focus." It partnered with Seatrees, a nonprofit organization that has been working on identifying new ways to restore coral ecosystems.</p><p>In a detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/coral-in-focus-samsung-marks-one-year-of-marine-ecosystem-restoration-with-galaxy-technology">post</a>, the company revealed that scientists have been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>'s "Ocean Mode" instead of bulky underwater camera equipment to capture vivid pictures of coral reefs in Fiji, Indonesia, and the United States.</p><p>This camera feature, exclusively developed for the coral reef project, significantly reduces blue tones in pictures, which are prominent in underwater photography. Additionally, this feature also minimizes the blurring of images during movement, "optimized by shutter speed and multi-frame image processing." Potentially reducing the challenges that people face when capturing images underwater.</p>

<p>The Ocean Mode also helps with capturing multiple shots at a pre-set time interval, instead of having the user manually press the shutter button each time they want to click an image, which could turn out to be very tedious when underwater.</p><p>This mode allows the user to pre-set the time, the number of images that need to be captured, and all they have to do is click on the shutter button once. The phone will then click a series of images that are essential for researchers when creating accurate 3D models of these reefs.</p><p>It's important to note that this feature isn't available on the standard Galaxy S24 Ultra devices on the market.</p>

<p>This has helped marine researchers produce "seventeen 3D models of coral reefs to analyze the health and growth of reefs." And a total of 11,046 coral fragments were planted to restore 10,705 square meters of coral reef habitat, which is roughly the size of 25 basketball courts, Samsung added.</p><p>This automated photography approach not only saves time but also ensures that each shot delivers accurate images of these coral reefs, contributing to effective analysis of these tiny aquatic animals.</p><p>This project is a part of Samsung's broader "Galaxy for the Planet" initiative that was started in 2021. Samsung has also been recycling discarded fishing nets and incorporating the material into its smartphones since the Galaxy S22 series.</p>
