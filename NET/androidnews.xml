                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple took a big swing with the AirPods Pro 3 this year, and while they won't be for everyone as a result, these earbuds will be the absolute <strong>best</strong> for most people. I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>, and found them to have the best active noise-canceling performance of any pair of wireless earbuds I've tested. They've only been out for a few months, and that's why it's incredible to see AirPods Pro 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/" target="_blank"><strong>already discounted to $219.99 on Amazon.</strong></a></p><p>The same deal is live on Best Buy, Target, and Walmart as well, and it means now is the perfect time to save on AirPods Pro 3 as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> approaches. It's the lowest price we've ever seen for this model of AirPods, down from their usual $249.99 retail price. Here's who the AirPods Pro 3 is (and isn't) made for.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="55292976-29b2-47a8-a98d-5dc95687c64f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" data-dimension48="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mDDakVQLoJ8mPmv3LBAhxd" name="airpods-pro-3-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDDakVQLoJ8mPmv3LBAhxd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AirPods Pro 3: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/" target="_blank" data-dimension112="55292976-29b2-47a8-a98d-5dc95687c64f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" data-dimension48="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" data-dimension25=""><del><u>$249.00</u></del><u> </u><u><strong>$219.99 at Amazon</strong></u></a></p><p>We don't cover Apple products very often, but some devices are simply too good to miss. The AirPods Pro 3 feature a new design, more bass, and better active noise-canceling quality. The earbuds last longer on a single charge and use a hybrid silicone-foam ear tip design for security, comfort, and better passive sound isolation. For some, they'll be the best-sounding AirPods yet.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/apple-airpods-pro-3-wireless-active-noise-cancelling-earbuds-with-heart-rate-sensing-feature-white/JJGCQLYK5F/sku/6376563" target="_blank">Best Buy - $219.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/AirPods-nbsp-Pro-nbsp-3/17835006350" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">Walmart - $219.99</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Translation-Headphones-High-Fidelity/dp/B0FQFB8FMG/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="55292976-29b2-47a8-a98d-5dc95687c64f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" data-dimension48="AirPods Pro 3: $249.00" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need the best ANC earbuds, you want earbuds with a heart-rate monitor, you like a bassy sound profile.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you like the design and sound of AirPods Pro 2; you don't like the in-ear feel of foam ear tips.</p><p>There are a few things to know about the AirPods Pro 3, starting with their ANC and sound quality prowess. Apple calls it "the world's best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones," and I absolutely believe it. The AirPods Pro 3 can turn almost any environment into near-silence, without needing to play any background music to drown out compressed ambient sound. Other earbuds like AirPods Pro 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2</a> can get close, but nothing surpasses AirPods Pro 3.</p><p>Additionally, the sound quality, though a bit bass-heavy, is stellar. There's the advanced Apple H2 audio processor inside to handle sound and ANC quality. Despite all the inner-workings going on to provide best-in-class ANC power, these earbuds still last for eight hours on a single charge.</p><p>From a design and comfort standpoint, Apple changed the angle at which the ear tips enter your ear canal to be more comfortable for most. They're now foam tips wrapped in silicone, so they won't fall out of your ears as easily and will passively block more noise. Some people, including myself, find the new design to be less comfortable. However, if you've found the usual AirPods design to be comfortable in the past, the AirPods Pro 3 should fit just fine.</p><p>Combined with the best ANC you can find in a pair of earbuds, AirPods Pro 3 are a compelling package. At $30 off, these are some of the best you can find for just $220 for a limited time. And thanks to holiday return policies from stores like Amazon and Best Buy, you can try them out worry-free into January 2026.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">Black Friday 2025 — quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

For a first update, this one’s pretty loaded, coming in at 2.3GB.</p><p>OnePlus is positioning this release as a “new level of seamless experience,” and it's evident with improvements to app launch speeds from the Home screen. The update also leans heavily into personalization, with options to resize clocks when using certain Flux themes, rename widgets, and stack same-sized widgets by dropping them on top of each other.</p><p>The Photos app gets smarter, too. When cropping portraits, buildings, or anything with clear lines, the phone now offers automatic straightening so you don’t have to fiddle with sliders as much. And if you want a more expressive ringtone, you can finally set videos as system ringtones.</p><p>OnePlus is also touching up the lock screen. The fingerprint scanner animation gets a glow effect that looks cleaner and more modern. While it's not a game-changer, it's definitely more polished than the stock animation that shipped with the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:211px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:426.54%;"><img id="uBzq4wtRuyAi5ezEehULJJ" name="OnePlus-15-software-update" alt="first software update for the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBzq4wtRuyAi5ezEehULJJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="211" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="under-the-hood-improvements-and-better-protection-2">Under-the-hood improvements and better protection</h2><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>'s first update includes the November 2025 Android security patch, so you’re getting the latest vulnerability fixes alongside all the UI polish. Phone Manager also boosts its virus-scanning speed, which should help with regular background checks.</p><p>Network tools get one of the more interesting upgrades. OnePlus adds an interface for its AI LinkBoost Network Engine, giving you real-time insight into network optimizations, latency reductions, and more. If your signal suddenly dips or you’re in a spot with unstable connectivity, you’ll now get notifications when the phone kicks network acceleration into gear.</p><p>There’s also a built-in speed test that shows upload and download rates along with latency, so you can troubleshoot your connection without jumping to third-party apps.</p> ]]></dc:content>

None of the other options really offer everything I want in earbuds, although some come close, and that's why I finally opted to get the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 as soon as they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DT2344N3/">went on sale for Black Friday</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> are normally $250, but right now you can save $50 and snag them for $200.

They made it much easier to control my music and calls hands-free, without having to worry about accidentally activating something or changing the song if I wanted to adjust the fit. They also made it easy to turn the earbuds off without needing to put them in a case, which often negated the need to carry the charging case around.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Beats Powerbeats Pro 2</a> are the closest thing I could find that offers the same kind of functionality. The physical buttons are great for switching tracks, and they even have separate volume buttons, so I don't really have to take out my phone at all. The only thing that's missing is the ability to turn them off with the buttons, but it's a feature I think I can live without.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="n9dTVwyHh78Ec3hyDMGKTV" name="beats-powerbeats-pro-2-volume-rocker.JPG" alt="Powerbeats Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n9dTVwyHh78Ec3hyDMGKTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've only just received the Powerbeats Pro 2, but so far I'm thoroughly enjoying them.

I'm still getting used to putting them on, as I haven't worn earbuds like this in a long time, but once they're secure, they're <em>secure</em>.</p><p>The battery also lasts a long time, and the charging case (which is unfortunately rather large) adds as much as 45 hours of battery life. Oh, and did I mention that it can monitor your heart rate and connect to other apps/workout equipment? I haven't tried this yet, but we've found them to be rather accurate in our testing.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The transition started to take effect for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-for-android-auto-is-starting-to-replace-google-assistant">some Android Auto users earlier this month</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/google-unleashes-gemini-on-android-auto-for-a-smarter-and-more-conversational-drive">rollout officially began</a> Nov. 20. Not long after, there are signs that Google is preparing to deprecate Google Assistant from Android Auto completely after the new year. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/androidauto/answer/6348083" target="_blank">support document</a> quietly states that Assistant won't be available for much longer.</p><p>The document, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/24/google-assistant-shutdown-date-support-page-message/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, states that "Google Assistant is still available for use until March 2026." The message specifically refers to the Android Auto platform, not the entire Google ecosystem. Some platforms, like Android and Wear OS, are further along in the Gemini transition than others, including Google Home and Google TV. Here's the full disclaimer:</p><div><blockquote><p>Gemini is replacing Google Assistant on most mobile devices. Learn more about what you can do with Gemini, privacy, protection of minors and availability for supported devices, languages and territories. Gemini will understand the same commands as Google Assistant and also give you the option to speak naturally. Google Assistant is still available for use until March 2026.</p><p>Google</p></blockquote></div><p>While the full banner message calls out the transition as being for "most mobile devices," this message only appears with the March 2026 cutoff date on the Android Auto Help page. Still, considering Google says the Gemini for Android Auto rollout will continue over the coming months, it may prove to be a quick cutoff date.</p><p>It is possible Google makes Google Assistant available on Android Auto beyond March 2026, and is simply priming users for the change ahead of time. It's not uncommon for Google to extend these software deprecation timelines. For example, the company just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-duo-is-spared-for-a-few-extra-months-as-eventual-shutdown-looms">extended the Google Duo shutdown by a few months</a>, after the original September 2025 target came and went.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google may not be holding itself to its initial Assistant shutdown timeframes for other platforms, either. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">originally said in March 2025</a> that "later this year, the classic Google Assistant will no longer be accessible on most mobile devices, or available for new downloads on mobile app stores." While there's still time for Google to meet this target, 2025 is coming to a close fast.</p><p>Google's latest support document previews Assistant's run on Android Auto coming to an end on Android Auto in March 2026, but it's unclear how or if this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-continues-pushing-out-google-assistant-in-a-steady-rebrand-effort">affects the Assistant experience</a> on other platforms.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while they're waiting to share official details, the Watch Lite certainly <em>looks</em> like the skinny Oppo Watch S announced last month.</p><p>Like the Silver <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opposhop.cn/cn/web/products/36927.html">Oppo Watch S</a>, the OnePlus Watch Lite has a rotating crown, a white silicone strap with three grooves and four orange dots, and a distinct contoured case that juts out along the right side.</p><p>Assuming OnePlus does repurpose its parent company's design for the Watch Lite, it would be distinctly light and skinny, weighing just 35g and measuring 8.9mm thick, with a 1.46-inch AMOLED display that hits 3,000 nits of brightness. But this is unconfirmed; we'll need to wait until December 17 for OnePlus to reveal its Watch Lite specs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1287px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RWx6xpgMpPYt8QibX3hZJ8" name="Oppo-Watch-S-promo-image" alt="A promo image of the Oppo Watch S smartwatch, with a skinny, metal case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RWx6xpgMpPYt8QibX3hZJ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1287" height="724" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Oppo Watch S </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oppo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/oneplus-just-dropped-its-own-apple-watch-se-rival-with-the-affordable-watch-lite">Techradar</a> that the Watch Lite is "a device designed to bring flagship-level health and fitness features to an even more accessible price point," and that the Silver Steel finish "delivers a clean, modern look with a subtle shine that suits both everyday wear and active lifestyles."</p><p>Otherwise, OnePlus hasn't shared other official details. The biggest question is whether the OnePlus Watch Lite will use Wear OS like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, or a proprietary RTOS to maximize battery life and challenge other budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>.</p><p>OnePlus launched the mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> with Wear OS in 2024, and it's still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">best cheap Android smartwatches</a> available today. Choosing "Watch Lite" instead of Watch 3R could be a simple rebranding to make its low price clearer, or it could signal a shift away from Wear OS.

The update reportedly adds a preview to a received email's notification in the notification panel.

Another change 9to5 notes is that if an attachment is received in an email, its preview will replace its body, meaning you'll have to open it fully in Gmail to see what was written.</p><p>This update seems to have started rolling out since late last week; however, it's still quite slow.

To get you ready for the holidays, Gmail now displays all orders and tracking details within an "Arriving Soon" tab at the top of its section.

First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/hey-google-voice-match-assistant-branding-scrubbed-3618897/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> app’s settings are being reworked so the old “Hey Google & Voice Match” section will soon be called “Talk to Gemini hands-free."</p><p>For years, that screen has screamed Google Assistant. Now, new details found in the latest Gemini app (version 1.0.795460806) show Google replacing the Assistant branding with Gemini in the wake-word setup. You still get the toggle to enable hands-free activation and a separate “Manage Voice Match” page, but the old Assistant label is being pushed out of sight.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="GSavuazPVDju7YbPTeySvZ" name="Gemini-app-settings-page" alt="settings page in the gemini app where Assistant branding is being phased out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSavuazPVDju7YbPTeySvZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="L6NuC4kzDy6eBrcvzSWSvZ" name="Gemini-app-settings-page" alt="settings page in the gemini app where Assistant branding is being phased out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L6NuC4kzDy6eBrcvzSWSvZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="doBPzKhHiAZUCaRkkM2ttZ" name="Gemini-app-settings-page" alt="settings page in the gemini app where Assistant branding is being phased out" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/doBPzKhHiAZUCaRkkM2ttZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It’s well known that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Google is in the process of moving the mobile Assistant experience to Gemini</a> and plans to retire the classic Assistant on most phones in the future.</p><h2 id="the-function-remains-the-same-2">The function remains the same</h2><p>Behind the scenes, there’s no sign that Google has made big changes to how voice recognition itself works.

It basically provides the "dream" scenario for potential Chromebook buyers, as this chip is powerful enough to handle heavy multi-tasking, along with supporting more on-device AI features and functionality.</p><p>At the same time, Acer understands how important versatility is when it comes to getting a new Chromebook, and the Spin 514 delivers here, too. The convertible design lets you use this Chromebook in a variety of different ways, such as folding the screen back and using your favorite USI pen to take notes, draw, or even just play games without the keyboard getting in the way.</p><p>Many Chromebooks manage to check off those two boxes, but are often at the mercy of subpar or disappointing battery life. That's not an issue with the Spin 514, as this beast is rated to last for up to a whopping 17 hours of battery life on a single charge. It doesn't get much better than that.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Bose makes some of the best Bluetooth speakers, and its SoundLink range has four models targeted at portable use. I used all four SoundLink models, and with Bose rolling out exciting discounts before Black Friday starts in earnest, I'm going to detail which model is ideally suited for your needs.</p><p>Before we get to that, here's a quick look at the details of the sale:</p><ul><li><strong>Bose SoundLink Micro: $129 </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0FDLD34V5"><strong>now $109 (16% off)</strong></a></li><li><strong>Bose SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen: $149 </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0D6WD2QSQ"><strong>now $119 (20% off)</strong></a></li><li><strong>Bose SoundLink Plus: </strong><del><strong>$269</strong></del><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0F7HVC62G"><strong>now $189 (29% off)</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><strong>Bose SoundLink Max: $399 </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/dp/B0CVL1K7DX/"><strong>now $299 (25% off)</strong></a></li></ul><p>The SoundLink Micro is the stating variant and is a diminutive 5W speaker you can take anywhere, the SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen is the ideal party speaker thanks to its design and ability to deliver 60W of sound, and it hits the sweet spot in the portfolio.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-soundlink-plus-portable-bluetooth-speaker-sublime">SoundLink Plus</a> is the next size up, with the 80W speaker a good choice if you want room-filling sound. And as the name suggests, the SoundLink Max is the biggest speaker in this range, with a 100W driver that sounds nothing short of incredible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UjrWH6Y9XZufZKsXywKYyg" name="Bose SoundLink all models" alt="All four Bose SoundLink Bluetooth speakers highlighted on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UjrWH6Y9XZufZKsXywKYyg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Out of the four models, I think the SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen is the one to get if you just need a go-anywhere Bluetooth speaker with great sound. The Flex is the ideal size, and at 450g, it isn't too heavy while still delivering 60W audio. The Micro is a good choice if you need something small you can just attach to the outside of your bag, and while it sounds good in its own right, it doesn't get anywhere as loud or detailed as its siblings.</p><p>If size isn't an issue and you just need the best possible sound, the Max would be my recommendation. At 4lb (1.8kg), it is heavier than the rest of the models put together, but you also get highly engaging sound with an excellent bass, and it is more than enough to provide wall-shaking sound at a party. The SoundLink Plus shares a lot of the same characteristics, but is easier to carry around, and doesn't cost as much.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d33b646b-61ce-4cdc-af17-77c0a53a505f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Bose's website has the Flex" data-dimension48="Bose's website has the Flex" data-dimension25="$119" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0D6WD2QSQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.73%;"><img id="qV7h7ThFfvHE4mbZhVfu2o" name="Bose SoundLink Flex" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qV7h7ThFfvHE4mbZhVfu2o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1021" height="763" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen is my recommendation if you need a Bose Bluetooth speaker.

What's also good to see is that all models get IP67 dust and water resistance, so you can easily use these at the pool or at the beach without any worries whatsoever.</p><p>If I had to buy one of these speakers, I'd just get the SoundLink Flex 2nd Gen. The flatter design makes it easier to throw in a bag, and you still get great sound. The rugged durability is what ultimately makes it a great choice, and it's a good overall value — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0F2L6BTSL/ref=pd_lpo_d_sccl_3/140-0746313-2876064?pd_rd_w=TEQlK&content-id=amzn1.sym.4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_p=4c8c52db-06f8-4e42-8e56-912796f2ea6c&pf_rd_r=CF9CEPE6C5DWQEGJZ02V&pd_rd_wg=11sQs&pd_rd_r=41723d36-f7ca-4538-bf5a-d8d836666d73&pd_rd_i=B0D6WD2QSQ&th=1">particularly at $119</a>.</p><p>I'm also a fan of the SoundLink Plus, and this is the model I used the longest. It strikes the ideal balance between portability and powerful sound, and while it isn't as big or heavy as the Max, it still somehow holds its own. And now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Dustproof/dp/B0F7HVC62G">that it's down to $189</a>, it is the best value out of the entire SoundLink portfolio.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, the Yoges battery headstrap fixes <em>both</em> of those problems in one fell swoop, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG53VR6C/?th=1"><strong>now at $36.09</strong></a>, making it $100 less than the official Meta Elite battery headstrap.</p><p>If you've only used the default cloth headstrap this entire time, you have no idea what you're missing. Not only does this Elite-style strap add a substantial amount of comfort due to its rigid construction and supple padding around the top and back of your head, but it's also unbelievably easy to adjust thanks to an ergonomic wheel at the back that loosens and tightens the strap with just a turn.</p><p>To make things even better, a rechargeable, magnetically attachable battery pack comes with the headset and can be popped on to triple the battery life of your Meta Quest headset. It charges via USB-C, so any charger you've got on hand should do the trick. It's the best of both worlds, and it's dirt cheap right now thanks to this early Black Friday deal.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="5946462d-1545-4db2-a5fa-b857bcaca8bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: $59.99" data-dimension48="Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: $59.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG53VR6C/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.22%;"><img id="YFv3MfJt82UfpFbhmykCLT" name="yoges-battery-head-strap-quest-3-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFv3MfJt82UfpFbhmykCLT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1472" height="1225" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG53VR6C/" data-dimension112="5946462d-1545-4db2-a5fa-b857bcaca8bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: $59.99" data-dimension48="Yoges 10000mAh battery headstrap: $59.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$59.99</del> <strong>$36.09 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>When it comes to Elite-style straps, you won't find one better than this Yoges battery headstrap.

After quietly stripping out the dedicated perspective correction tool a few months ago, Google appears to be bringing the feature back to the app.</p><p>Earlier this year, the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/news-weekly-pixel-aug-23-2025">suddenly removed the basic straightening and skew adjustment tool</a>, taking away one of its most useful editing features without any warning. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-perspective-3618673/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has found signs in a recent build of the app suggesting that the "Perspective crop" option is quietly reappearing for some people — and its comeback feels like Google admitting the removal never made sense in the first place.</p><p>After the change, users had to rely on awkward workarounds, third-party apps, or the basic auto-straightening options in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-photo-view-refresh-glanceable-details-action-menu">Google Photos</a>. Some similar options are available in the main crop interface. If you tap the Auto Frame button, a level indicator appears so you can adjust an image's perspective, as shown below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:419px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.64%;"><img id="MVqV3PSi3cEzhRcv2xXJ2E" name="Google-Photos-straighten-tool" alt="straighten tool in Google Photos app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MVqV3PSi3cEzhRcv2xXJ2E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="419" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-awkward-workarounds-we-endured-2">The awkward workarounds we endured</h2><p>However, these options lacked the granular vertical and horizontal corrections that made the original tool so essential — especially for fixing leaning buildings, wonky desk shots, and lopsided wide-angle photos.</p><p>You’ll know the perspective crop tool is available when its icon appears in the crop menu or through the framing shortcut in the top-left corner. Once it shows up, it works just as you’d expect. You can straighten photos, fix warped lines, and adjust awkward angles with full manual control again.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxKlOHBbohA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Not everyone has access to the tool yet. Google still needs to enable the feature for more users. If Google brings back Perspective for everyone, editing photos will be faster and much less frustrating. Many users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1m71sja/editing_in_google_photos_app_has_changed/" target="_blank">have said</a> that removing the tool made simple edits harder than they needed to be.</p><p>For now, the easiest way to check is to open any photo and look at your editing bar. If you see the perspective crop icon, you’re among the first to get it back, which could mean a wider rollout is coming.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Last week, the remedies trial in the case came to an end, and Brinkema will soon decide whether to order Google to sell off part of the ad tech business, including a breakup of Google Ad Manager.</p><p>The U.S. Department of Justice is trying to force a sale of Google's ad marketplace platform, AdX, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/google-aims-dodge-breakup-ad-business-antitrust-trial-wraps-2025-11-21/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. While the publication notes the federal judge overseeing the case said "time is of the essence," she also acknowledged how Google's planned appeals could complicate things.</p><p>"The kind of request you are making most likely would not be as easily enforceable while an appeal is pending," Brinkema told the DOJ following closing arguments in the remedies trial.</p><p>Google not only sees a forced sale of part of its ad tech business as too extreme of a measure, it also is arguing it is technically impossible, according to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/court-testimony-risk-disruption-doj-proposals/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "Testimony showed that the DOJ’s proposal to break up Google Ad Manager is unworkable and would create significant uncertainty and disruption for advertisers and publishers," wrote Le-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, in the blog post.</p><div><blockquote><p>We've said from the beginning that the DOJ's case ignores immense competition and dynamism of the ad tech market ... We'll continue to advocate for a resolution that addresses the Court's concerns without stifling the growth of American businesses that choose to use our tools to grow.</p><p>Le-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs</p></blockquote></div><p>The company called various experts to testify as to how a breakup of Google's ad tech business could be impossible to implement. One expert, Google Professor Jason Nieh, said the decision would be a "highly complicated software engineering undertaking, with … no guarantee of success."</p><p>On the other hand, Matthew Huppert, the DOJ attorney, argued that the breakup would be the only way to achieve a "brighter, more competitive future for the open web."</p><p>Now, Brinkema will decide how to remedy Google's two illegal ad tech monopolies, considering the arguments from the company and the U.S. DOJ.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In this case, it's a company named Reconext, which Meta describes as "a leading prover of aftermarket lifestyle services for electronics" with "more than 20 years of experience evaluating used electronic equipment."</p><p>The trade-in device must be in working condition and include its case and charger. Buyers need to send in their old device within 30 days of receiving the shipping label for it. Once they complete the purchase, they'll complete a separate questionnaire that determines the exact trade-in quote.</p><p>This value "may be more than, less than, or of no value compared to the official quote that was conveyed to you" after it is inspected by Reconext. After inspection, the value of your trade-in will be refunded to your original payment method.</p><p>While we don't know if Meta's trade-in program will be permanent, this pilot is a way for Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 owners to upgrade to Gen 2 or an Oakley style at a discount.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With top scores on major benchmarks, Gemini 3 Pro promises unprecedented reasoning and multimodal capabilities, redefining user interaction.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini 3</a> rollout marks the first time Google is shipping a new AI model in Search on day one. AI Mode in Search users can leverage the model's better reasoning and agentic coding capabilities to get help with tougher questions, while creating multimodal responses that include text and interactive visuals. It's also arriving in the Gemini app, bringing a Gemini Agent that can handle multi-step tasks independently.</p><p>Gemini 3 launches with Gemini 3 Pro in preview, plus a sneak peek at Gemini 3 Deep Think, an even smarter AI model that will come to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks. Google says more Gemini 3 versions will be released "soon" as the company builds out its next-generation suite of AI models.</p><h2 id="gemini-3-reclaims-the-top-spot-on-the-lmarena-and-webdev-arena-leaderboards-2">Gemini 3 reclaims the top spot on the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ" name="gemini_3_lm_arena_leaderboard (1)" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EMTRzVPAeZdynpw9aV5pmQ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Gemini 2.5 models</a>, released in March 2025, performed well on top AI benchmarks for months before losing ground to xAI and Anthropic models of late. Gemini 3 Pro flips that trend, as the AI model leads both the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards immediately following its launch. Compared to Gemini 2.5 Pro, the new model significantly outperforms it on every major AI benchmark.</p><p>Notably, Gemini 3 Pro tops the LMArena leaderboard with a score of 1,501 points, dethroning Grok 4.1 Thinking, which earned a score of 1,483 points. For perspective, the Gemini 2.5 Pro model slotted in at third place with 1,452 points before Gemini 3 Pro's release. In other benchmarks, like Humanity's Last Exam, Gemini 3 Pro scored 37.5% without tool use — a result that demonstrates PhD-level reasoning, according to Google.</p><p>For the average user, Gemini 3 crucially "brings a new level of depth and nuance to every interaction." AI models tend to have a people-pleasing nature to them. They tell users what they want to hear, not what is actually true. Gemini 3 Pro responses are "smart, concise, and direct" by comparison, aiming to dispel the notion that AI models can't tell users what they need to hear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R" name="gemini_3_webdev_arena_leaderboard" alt="The Gemini 3 Pro results on the LMArena/WebDev Arena leaderboards." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5dS8t4FjurM3s6ZpiVXD7R.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For website creation and generative user-interface design, Gemini 3 is "the best vibe coding and agentic coding model" Google says it has ever built. That's demonstrated by a leading 1,487 ELO score on the WebDev Arena leaderboard, and better performance on Terminal-Bench 2.0 and SWE-bench Verified benchmarks. The result is a Gemini 3 Pro model that can build playable 3D video games from scratch, create websites, or fulfill your vibe-coding needs.</p><p>For better performance, there's Gemini 3 Deep Think, improving results on Humanity's Last Exam to 41% without tool use. It pushes Gemini 3's reasoning and multimodal understanding capabilities further, helping users solve the most complex of problems. This model is currently undergoing extra safety evaluations and will reach safety testers before it hits Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="gemini-3-is-now-live-in-google-ai-studio-vertex-ai-gemini-cli-and-antigravity-2">Gemini 3 is now live in Google AI Studio, Vertex AI, Gemini CLI, and Antigravity</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xHtg7Nf7hpRB7PQ42dUdD7" name="Gemini-3-Developers" alt="Using Gemini 3 in Google's developer tools." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHtg7Nf7hpRB7PQ42dUdD7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini 3 is not only widely rolling out in Google's consumer products, it's also becoming available for developers.

This revolutionary tool promises faster, more accurate predictions for applications like Search and Maps, enhancing users' weather experiences across the platform.</p><p>Google is calling it the company's "most advanced and efficient forecasting model." It's now eight-times faster at generating weather forecasts and has a resolution time of up to one hour. Like the WeatherNext 1 model it replaces, WeatherNext 2 generates four six-hour weather forecasts daily, with lead times of up to 15 days for future predictions.</p><p>While WeatherNext 1 models are remaining available for reference and research purposes, WeatherNext 2 is the future for Google weather forecasting. It surpasses the original on 99.9% of variables, according to Google, including temperature, wind speed and direction, precipitation, humidity, and pressure.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YQwqoEm_xis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>WeatherNext 2 can quickly and efficiently predict weather scenarios from a single starting point, Google says.

Oakley Meta Vanguard has the same tech, but a polar-opposite approach and audience.</p><p>You're not wearing these into a museum or on vacation to learn about art and landmarks, nor on a late-evening stroll for music.

These models have slightly shorter battery life, worse water resistance, quieter speakers, no action button, and an offset camera sensor.

So I'm confident that Vanguard glasses will continue to receive new features that improve the experience; in particular, I think the Garmin partnership will improve with more stats and better shortcuts.</p><p>If you're at all interested in what Vanguard has to offer, I think they're worth buying. But if you're scared off by the weight or don't like Vanguard's wide portrait photography, you should look elsewhere.

Tapping once plays or pauses your phone's music; a double tap or triple tap skips ahead or back in your playlist. Tapping-and-holding summons Meta AI by default, though you can customize this to activate other apps like Audible or Spotify.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard has two buttons. You press the main capture button to take a photo, or hold it down to start a video recording, then press it again to end the video. The second Action button can be customized to trigger Hyperlapse or Slow Motion videos, Be My Eyes mode, or Garmin Autocapture mode, or to read out specific Garmin stats (HR, duration, distance, or pace) during a workout.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I use my Garmin watch with Oakley Meta Vanguard?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>You must install the <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/apps/e9044ba2-20b0-40a4-9d8e-3e13193b6f5f?tid=1">Meta AI Connect IQ app</a> on your <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>; that link shows which watches and Edge computers are compatible, but it's mostly models from the last few years, excluding cheaper or slower models like the Instinct 3.</p><p>In the Meta AI app, tap the Settings cog next to your Vanguard glasses, open App connections, tap Garmin, then "Connect Garmin." It'll show step-by-step directions, including installing the above app; you'll need to ensure that the Meta AI app is installed for each Garmin activity profile (like Run or Bike) before your Vanguard glasses will recognize your stats for that activity.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Are Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses "waterproof" or water resistant?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While they have an IP67 rating — which means they are "protected against the effects of temporary immersion in water" — Oakley Meta Vanguard aren't meant for swimming or other water sports. They'll handle sweat and rain, but you should still dry them off before putting them in the case.</p><p>Meta warns that you shouldn't rinse them under a sink to clean them, use them for high-speed water sports, or wear them in high-humidity areas like saunas. And the charging case has no IP rating, so you should be very careful not to get it wet.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

For example, Amazon's Black Friday Week sale has officially begun, with deals including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-A36-Smartphone-Connectivity-Performance/dp/B0DXHKH86B" target="_blank"><strong>$100 off the price of the Samsung Galaxy A36</strong></a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-the-existence-of-the-unreleased-galaxy-a56-a36-and-a26">Samsung launched the Galaxy A36 earlier this year</a> alongside the A26 and A56, all offering a more affordable take on the company's tech than its flagship and premium phones. As such, the A36 isn't going to offer flawless performance, but it does come with an AMOLED display featuring a 120Hz refresh rate. This particular deal is for the 128GB version of the phone, though Samsung also offers a 256GB configuration.</p><p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/cheapest-samsung-phones-you-can-buy-today">best cheap Samsung phone</a>, the A36 also comes with the user-friendly One UI 7,  three rear cameras, a front camera, and a 5,000mAh battery. It also boasts an improved processor from the previous generation version, while it also comes with "Intelligent Features" such as access to Bixby, the AI Select tool, and more. The A36 also normally retails at $400, so the $300 Black Friday price tag represents a solid 25% discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-A36-Smartphone-Connectivity-Performance/dp/B0DXHKH86B" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5" name="samsung galaxy a36 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-A36-Smartphone-Connectivity-Performance/dp/B0DXHKH86B" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$299.99 for Amazon's Black Friday Week</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> Week has landed, and Amazon has kicked it off with a 25% discount on the Samsung Galaxy A36.

It also comes with useful "Intelligent Features" such as the useful AI Select tool, and the ability to have Bixby read documents and web pages out loud. It's worth noting that this phone doesn't include Qi wireless charging, though you won't find that on many phones around this price point.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>major discounts on Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>official Black Friday discounts on tablets, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday (so far)</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google was hard at work upgrading the Gemini app in November, giving users a new large language model (LLM), image-generation model, and video-generation model. These updates rolled out gradually throughout the month, and are recapped in Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-drop-november-2025/" target="_blank">Gemini Drop</a> for November. If you haven't followed every singe announcement, this is a great way to figure out the new Gemini app you need to try.</p><p>The big change is the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-3-available-now-everything-you-need-to-know">Gemini 3</a>, the company's latest and greatest LLM. Google calls it the "most intelligent model" it has ever made, with deep understanding and stellar vibe coding abilities. The update first debuted on the Gemini web client, and now, it's available in the Gemini app on iOS and Android.</p><p>To use it, tap the current model listed at the bottom of the Gemini app home screen — usually <strong>2.5 Flash</strong> — to open the model selector. Then, tap <strong>Thinking</strong> to switch to the preview Gemini 3 Pro model, the first one to release as part of the next-generation Gemini 3 series. The release corresponds with a new Gemini mobile app view, which adds a <strong>My Stuff</strong> page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-tweaks-geminis-android-app-with-a-fresh-homepage-and-my-stuff-view">for images, videos, and Canvas content</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV" name="Gemini-App-Redesign-Nov-2025" alt="The various Gemini app screens tweaked in a Nov 2025 redesign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also changed out the Gemini app's image- and video-generation models this month. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a> (Gemini 3 Pro Image) replaces Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) in the Gemini app as the default image generator, at least to start. Free users get a few free generations before the model reverts back to Nano Banana, while Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers get higher rate limits.</p><p>For videos, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">Veo 3.1</a> is the default video-generation model, and it now supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos">the <strong>Ingredients to Video</strong> feature</a> first made available in Flow. It allows users to upload three images that will guide a video prompt, and it aims to shorten the length of prompts needed to generate a requested video. Between the addition of Nano Banana Pro and Veo 3.1 Ingredients to Video, it's clear the new My Stuff section of the Gemini app is part of a content-generation push.</p><p>For Google AI Ultra subscribers, the cornerstone feature added in November is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-gemini-agent-can-orchestrate-complex-tasks-on-your-behalf-in-the-gemini-app">Gemini Agent</a>. It can take actions on your behalf in the Google ecosystem and beyond, all while prioritizing user control. Gemini Agent is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>, the browser use tool that began testing in 2024.</p><p>Gemini Live also added "more adaptive and expressive" conversations this month, allowing users to customize the speed and tone of the AI assistant's responses.</p><h2 id="what-s-next-for-gemini-2">What's next for Gemini? </h2><p>Google had a busy month shipping Gemini features in November, and the compilation of them in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-drop-november-2025/" target="_blank">November Gemini Drop</a> suggests we've already seen the best additions this month has to offer. There's plenty to look forward too, though.</p><p>The company is currently safety testing Gemini 3 Deep Think, an even smarter AI model that will come to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks. Google also confirmed that more Gemini 3 models will be released "soon" to join Gemini 3 Pro in preview. We're likely to see a lightweight model, like Gemini 3 Flash or something similar, to replace or join Gemini 2.5 Flash for basic queries.</p><p>Google could also expand limited features, like Gemini Agent, to more users in the future. We'll have to wait until the December Gemini Drop to find out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As someone who has been using the original titanium version of the ring since it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">launched in October 2024</a>, I was excited to get my hands on this new, stylish take on the device, which Oura says “is designed to stand up to daily life while blending style and function.”</p><p>But it wasn't just the Oura Ring that got a glow-up; the Oura app was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/new-app-design/?srsltid=AfmBOoqh2CEdKQgL5ahUs70npvxKRQJaTLD_Nwd06Ml-GweYjW7SVLJb">updated with a new design</a> that gives my Android phone a touch of iOS. Both of these updates highlight how Oura is not just a health and wellness product, but also a lifestyle one, making wearable tech that blends in while also standing out.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case">new ceramic ring</a> doesn't come cheap, though, and you'll pay a hefty premium over the cheapest Oura Ring 4 model to get the new material.</p><p>After a month of using the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, is it worth the extra cost, or should you just spring for a cheaper finish?</p><h2 id="pretty-in-premium-2">Pretty in premium</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HSZfunYBNtiPbWx3gZsMcX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-09" alt="Wearing the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSZfunYBNtiPbWx3gZsMcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura isn't the first to bring a ceramic finish to its products, and I hope it isn't the last.

Most are pastels except for the Midnight blue option, which has a deeper hue and is probably my favorite of the lot. According to Oura, the colors were chosen "to complement a wide range of skin tones and personal styles."</p><p>Oura also notes that the ring should retain its hue over time, thanks to a process that creates the colors "with minerals inherent to the ceramic material itself," as opposed to using a surface color that can eventually fade.</p><p>In my use, I've noticed some areas where the color has seemingly been scratched off. You'll want to avoid handling certain objects that could scratch against the ring, like a metal dumbbell. Otherwise, I normally wear a rubber "case" around the Oura Ring, and it appears to work well enough to keep it from scratching. Unfortunately, Oura still doesn't offer first-party ring protectors, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYWTR51"><strong>I've found some on Amazon</strong></a> that work well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="f2ufr2uKPWMVZeE9QiDT4X" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-18" alt="Scratches on the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2ufr2uKPWMVZeE9QiDT4X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, Oura does provide a Ceramic Polishing Pad, which should be able to handle scuffs and scratches to make your Oura Ring like new again, although I didn't receive one with my unit.</p><p>If you're comparing the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic with the titanium model, you'll notice that the new finish makes the ring noticeably thicker and a bit heavier. The size of the ring never bothered me, although some of my friends have pointed out how they find the Oura Ring unpleasantly thick, so the new finish may not appeal to everyone despite its rather premium look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3913px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PW6nChTiK22x56QEyaFViX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-22" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic next to the Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PW6nChTiK22x56QEyaFViX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3913" height="2201" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic and titanium Oura Ring 4 are pretty much the same.

says the new card design "uses colors to signal your body’s different states according to your biometrics," while the My Health view provides a more visual glance at your long-term metrics.</p><div

Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> can still end up looking very much like tech, while Oura is trying to balance that out with a refined sense of style.</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn't come cheap, with the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic priced at $499. That's $150 more than the cheapest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-oura-ring-4-color-should-you-buy">Oura Ring 4 color options</a>, although it matches the price of the more expensive Gold and Rose Gold options. So, if you were already looking at the latter colors, you might want to give the Ceramic models a look. Otherwise, I would have a hard time recommending anyone spend this much on a smart ring, especially when you account for the subscription.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WWB3WX/"><strong>Oura Ring 4 is currently on sale for Black Friday</strong></a>, with as much as $150 off, depending on the color.</p><p>On the plus side, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is still FSA/HSA eligible, so you can use that purchase one. For many people, that money is just sitting there largely unused, so you might as well spend it on something.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How is the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic different from the titanium Oura Ring 4?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic features a new high-performance zirconia ceramic material, which is thicker and heavier than the titanium model. The color is inherent to the material, and therefore should last longer and retain its vibrance compared to the surface-level coating on the titanium model.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How can you clean the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Just like the titanium model, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic can be cleaned regularly with soap and water, thanks to its IP68 water and dust resistance rating. If the ring is scuffed or scratched with soft metals like a dumbbell, the included Ceramic Polishing Pad can be used to wipe them off.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What colors and sizes is the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic available in?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is available in four colors: Midnight, Tide, Petals, and Cloud.</p><p>The ring comes in 12 different sizes, from 4 to 15.

Truthfully, I LOVE seeing great deals on my favorite foldable phones, because it immediately squashes one of the most common hurdles that people face: the price.</p><p>While Google didn't raise the price of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold over its predecessor, the $1,800 price tag can be a tough pill to swallow, even when the payments are split up and added to your monthly bill. So with this deal, instead of shelling out enough money to cover a month of rent for a one-bedroom apartment somewhere, you're getting a 10 Pro Fold for the price of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/somehow-this-unbelievable-pixel-10-deal-returned">Pixel 10</a>!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5244px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-13" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5244" height="2950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going hand in hand with the price hurdle is the concern about durability with foldable phones in general. We can thank Google for this one, as it looks to squash any worries for those considering the 10 Pro Fold, thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof" target="_blank">IP68 water- and dust-resistance</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof"> rating</a>.</p><p>Frankly, I thought Samsung might've gotten there first with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, especially after removing the S Pen digitizer. Nope! It was Google, although I suspect this will change when Samsung releases the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Galaxy Z Fold 8</a> sometime next year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3753px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RMNDvmktqEKg6KJJmdmRuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3753" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To this point, I've been pretty glowing on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but even with the improved durability and premium design, it's far from <em>perfect</em>. My biggest complaint has been how it lacks the flagship camera experience you would find with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>I mean, Samsung managed to make its foldable thinner than a #2 pencil, but upgraded the primary camera to feature the same 200MP lens as the Galaxy S25 Ultra. You'll find no such luck with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and that's just downright disappointing, regardless of how much you spend on this foldable phone.</p><p>I was hoping that since Google wasn't going to introduce a completely new redesign, it would at least implement the same sensors as the 10 Pro, but it just wasn't meant to be.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANxQeidnJaJ7sSJ2zAoxbY" name="winlator-pixel-10-pro-fold" alt="Winlator main screen on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANxQeidnJaJ7sSJ2zAoxbY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My other issue is definitely a "first-world" problem, but it's that there is some wonky stuff going on with gaming performance on the Tensor G5. Apparently, it has something to do with the GPU drivers, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">Google claims</a> those drivers will be updated at some point in time. The downside is that we just don't know <em>when</em> that will be, meaning that it's a tough recommendation if you were excited about the expected gains that were supposed to be introduced with the Tensor G5.</p><p>So while it's not perfect, and it might not even be on your radar, we're talking about saving $1,000 on a phone that's only about a month old. Let me put it this way: I was already considering switching from Verizon to T-Mobile, and this deal is so good that it might actually push me over the edge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>How do I qualify for the $1,000 discount on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>In order to save $1,000 on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, you'll first need to either have an account with T-Mobile, or be willing to open a new account.

You might think you're just innocently scrolling through an app, reading an article, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">buying a new gadget</a>, but in reality, you're constantly leaving behind a trail of digital breadcrumbs. This trail is your personal data, and it's gold to the companies collecting it, especially around shopping days like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025">Black Friday</a>.</p><p>We all know how that part works, and we all have some opinion about it; maybe you don't even care. That doesn't mean what companies do with and how they use all that digital gold isn't important. This is exactly what sparked recent concerns about data collected from Gmail, though I'm here to tell you they're blown out of proportion.</p><p>It’s time we pull back the curtain on this digital exchange and talk about why knowing what companies are <em>actually</em> doing with your data isn't just a nerdy technical concern, but a core part of protecting your privacy, your wallet, and even your peace of mind.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The idea of Google collecting even more data is terrible, but the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/14615114" target="_blank">specifically tells you it's not being used to train AI</a>:</p><p><em>We do not use your workspace data to train or improve the underlying generative AI and large language models that power Gemini, Search, and other systems.</em></p><p>Google is using this data, once "anonymized," to help <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-gmail-protections-against-spam" target="_blank">fight spam</a> or improve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-enable-spell-check-on-chromebooks" target="_blank">spell-checking</a>.

If Google can improve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace tools</a>, it can then charge more.

If you aren't paying for a service, you can bet your data is.</p><p>Companies have built multi-billion-dollar business models on collecting as much data as possible. They use it to build an incredibly detailed, comprehensive, and sometimes unsettlingly accurate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-your-google-advertising-id-and-why-google-allowing-users-hide-it">digital profile</a> of you.

Data has turned into currency.</p><p>If they aren't selling it outright, they are using it to drive their own business model, like Google does. When you see an ad for a particular or obscure product you were just thinking about, that's not magic — that's your detailed profile in action.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dqTpbuAoKfr3MYRnic8zCc" name="google-search-shopping-feature-lifestyle-2.jpg" alt="Google Lens image search combined with text search on the Google Search app on a Pixel 6 phone held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dqTpbuAoKfr3MYRnic8zCc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"<em>Personalized</em>" is the digital buzzword for "<em>optimized to make you spend</em>."

We all appreciate having our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-manage-chromes-autofill-feature">shipping address remembered</a> or getting genuinely useful recommendations.</p><p>The problem starts when personalization veers into <strong>manipulation</strong>. Your data isn't just used to reflect your preferences; it's used to <em>predict</em> and <em>influence</em> your behavior.</p><p><strong>Price Discrimination:</strong> Your browsing history, device type, and even your location can be used to gauge how much you are <em>willing</em> to pay for a product. Companies may offer you a higher price than they offer someone else because their data profile suggests you can afford it or are less likely to shop around.</p><p><strong>Hyper-Targeted Messaging:</strong> Your profile allows advertisers to target you at your most vulnerable or receptive moments. If an app knows you're struggling financially, it might hit you with loan ads. If they know you've been reading about the Florida Keys, it might flood your feed with airline ticket prices.</p><p>When you understand that the goal of the algorithm is often not to <em>serve</em> you but to <em>steer</em> you, the importance of knowing the mechanism behind the steering wheel becomes clear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3" name="google-my-ads-center-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google My Ad Center on a Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1389" height="781" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Every piece of data collected is a liability waiting to be exploited. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/data-breaches-how-protect-yourself">Data breaches</a> happen, and the more data a company holds, the bigger target they become. Tech companies have huge budgets to prevent this, but it also applies to storefronts like Walmart and Target, or even your utility companies.</p><p>A bigger issue is what I call "unintended discrimination." Automated decision-making can lead to biased outcomes.</p><p>For example, your location data, online social connections, or even the places you shop could feed into an algorithm that decides your eligibility for a loan, a job interview, or even a higher education opportunity. Computers decide everything now, and computers have no ethics.

Yes, I know they are boring and often written in lawyer-speak, but you can count on companies following them. The liability of not doing it is too high, and why risk the gold mine by breaking your own rules?</p><p>Don't let the technical jargon intimidate you. You don't need a computer science degree to be a data-aware consumer. You just need to be <strong>curious</strong>. The next time an app or website asks for permission, pause and ask yourself two simple questions:</p><p><strong>Do they really need this data to provide the service?</strong></p><p><strong>What is the worst-case scenario if this data falls into the wrong hands?</strong></p><p>Knowing what companies are doing with your digital self is the essence of digital self-respect.

Neither of these things is bad on the phone, but other phones on sale during Black Friday may offer better specs.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the company's first phone to sport full U.S. support, including open sales at everyone's favorite retailers and compatibility with the uniquely weird wireless networks here. That also includes proper support for U.S. customers, something that wasn't always guaranteed with previous models sold under the "beta" program.</p><p>This phone is a particularly good recommendation here in the U.S. because, quite simply, we have very few smartphone options available when compared to the rest of the world. Nothing stands out as a UK brand with unique design characteristics, including a fast and fluid OS that isn't a bloated mess, plus the unique Glyph Matrix screen on the back that adds a bit of fun to the otherwise bland smartphone game.</p><p>Our review pointed out that what was offered here simply wasn't worth the $799 starting price, but $639 is a substantially better place to start. That's particularly where this deal excels, and it makes this unique phone an easy recommendation when you don't have $1000 or more to spend.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6ae6a556-5d88-4548-8cbf-b311318b78d4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This clear case feels great and doesn't ruin the unique look of your Nothing Phone 3.

Nelson hops right into the fire with the device, placing his sticky strip of numbers, marking the Mohs Scale of Hardness test's beginning. The phone features Gorilla Victus Glass 2, which begins to show signs of scratching at a level six, with even deeper marks at level seven.</p><p>The display even stands in the midst of the YouTuber's flame test without flinching or asking, "What's burning?"</p><p>The test moves to the back of the phone, which makes Nelson scratch his head a little. For context, he is using the Sandstone variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">OnePlus 15</a>, which utilizes a plastic material for its rear panel reinforced with fiber. This is unlike the other OnePlus 15 options that offer a glass back. Nelson didn't mind it, stating that he'd prefer plastic, considering it won't "shatter" if broken, like glass would. He can "deal with" the scratches over the shattered.</p><p>The side rails of the phone are quite durable, as well. Though there are incredibly obvious marks on it from his blade, Nelson states OnePlus' new coating will "handle regular scrapes and bumps better."</p><p>The moment most look forward to (and dread) is the bend test. Nelson applies the usual force to the OnePlus, and while it does bend ever-so-slightly with his thumbs on the front display, from behind, there is "no flex." You can watch the rest of Zack Nelson's durability test for the OnePlus 15 and learn more about the company's attempts at cooling the phone.</p><h2 id="it-s-here-and-it-s-showing-off-2">It's here, and it's showing off</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCqX0ZkoPMU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The OnePlus 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-debuts-early-worldwide-but-us-fans-have-a-longer-wait">launched just last week</a> with camera upgrades and even more performance enhancements.</p><p>The Chinese OEM applied Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC to power its major functions and brought in a triple 50MP camera array. What's also quite different on the OnePlus 15 is its design. The company revamped the phone's rear panel, dropping that side-mounted circular design for a more square array toward the top left of its back panel.</p><p>Moreover, the OnePlus 15 says goodbye to the flagship series' old Alert Slider in favor of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">Plus Key for AI</a>. While the OnePlus 15 doesn't sport Hasselblad tuning, since the company has started down its own path from the lessons learned, the phone's cameras are still pretty good, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">maybe better than most others</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is going for $899, but the device is on a delay in the U.S. When the phone launched, the U.S. government shutdown prevented it from debuting in the States. OnePlus plans to bring it to the U.S., but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">must seek FCC approval</a> first before doing so.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Apple Music and YouTube Music aren't far behind, and there are niche options like Deezer, Tidal, and Amazon Music too. Switching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> can be stressful, as users worry they'll use their stats, playlists, and music libraries. In an effort to court new subscribers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> is adding in-app TuneMyMusic playlist transfers to make the process of switching nearly seamless.</p><p>The company is partnering with TuneMyMusic to bring the versatile library transfer tool to the Spotify app. TuneMyMusic supports playlist transfers between Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and more services, and it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tunemymusic.com" target="_blank">web client</a>. It can transfer, share, or backup your music library, or use AI to create "the perfect playlist" based on its contents.</p><p>However, this process previously relied on users knowing about TuneMyMusic and seeking out the web-based transfer tool. Spotify's in-app TuneMyMusic integration completely removes that barrier to entry, making it easier for users to switch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, Spotify users can scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Your Library</strong> tab in the app, where they'll find an <strong>Import your music</strong> button. A few prompts will appear that connect to the TuneMyMusic service, where users can select the streaming service they want to transfer from. After that, users need only to select the playlists they want to import, and continue to have everything appear in their Spotify app library.</p><p>This feature reduces the friction involved in switching music streaming services, and it's available now on the iOS and Android versions of the Spotify app. It's rolling out globally over the next few days.</p><h2 id="the-other-ways-you-can-switch-music-streaming-services-2">The other ways you can switch music streaming services</h2><p>It's worth noting that TuneMyMusic will help you transfer a library to or from any of the following services, plus some others: Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, and Deezer. Spotify is the only streaming service to integrate TuneMyMusic directly into its mobile streamer. However, you can use the TuneMyMusic web client to transfer <em>from</em> Spotify to another music streaming service as well.</p><p>It's not the first time streaming companies have banded together to make switching easier. Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music and YouTube Music partnered in 2024</a> to create library transfer tools between its music streaming services.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This new functionality is also expected to work when sending files from an iPhone to a Pixel 10 as well. Talk about an industry-changing move.</p><p>The company states it has tested its "strong safeguards" with "independent security experts" to ensure that the data you're sending between devices remains protected. It's worth noting that as long as your Android device and iPhone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9286773" target="_blank">are set</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9286773" target="_blank"> to receive files from others</a>, this Quick Share/AirDrop update will work seamlessly.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Perplexity's AI-assisted browser, Comet, is making its way onto handheld Android devices this week.</p><p>Perplexity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/comet-for-android-is-here">announced</a> that its AI browser, Comet, is making its way from larger devices onto Android in a blog post. The company is highlighting the Comet browser as the user's "constant companion," capable of helping with anything they need or come across while browsing the web. This browsing assistant is capable of answering user questions and "taking action" on tasks you assign it.</p><p>Moreover, Perplexity states Android users can utilize the assistant's "expanded reasoning" to see what actions it's taking to fulfill their query and step in if necessary.</p><p>Taking Comet's assistance to another level is voice control. Users on Android can talk with Comet about anything they've got open on their browser. This includes the current page you're on, as well as all other open tabs, even if you're not there. Something Comet can do is "summarize your searches." This feature works across every open tab, meaning if you're conducting some research and have multiple pages open, Comet can quickly summarize everything to save you time.</p><p>The Comet browser is also quite conscious about only showing you what's important. Perplexity states the browser dodges spam and ads with a built-in ad blocker. Additionally, Comet for Android features a whitelist for websites you trust, just like its desktop counterpart.</p><h2 id="from-early-access-to-a-launch-on-mobile-2">From early access to a launch on mobile</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Asr9huXuheI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Other than summarizing tabs, Perplexity highlights Comet's ability to shop for the user. If there's something specific you're looking for, say, a price range for an item, and the retailer, you can give instructions to Comet, and it'll shop for you. What's more, Comet can understand content from an online textbook and can even quiz the user on the information there, if told to.</p><p>Comet is already available on the Google Play Store for download, meaning Android users can grab it today and get started.</p><p>After a limited launch in July, Perplexity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/comet-is-now-available-to-everyone-worldwide">released its Comet browser</a> for all users, for free, back in October. It was evident during its initial test that Perplexity dared to develop an AI assistant that was there for the user throughout their entire browsing session, not just for the little things, like a chatbot. The company stresses its ability to aid in e-commerce, research, meetings, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a press release, the company says the Phone 3 is receiving the update today, alongside a few exclusive Android 16 features, too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a> gains improved Flip to Glyph controls that let users choose between "silent" or "vibrate" modes.

Intwined in the Glyph Interface, Live Updates provide their usual set of real-time information for deliveries and rides; however, the Glyph Interface's involvement offers light-based cues to help users track.</p><p>Nothing states that "any app" in Android 16 that supports Live Updates can be used with Nothing's Glyph Progress feature.</p><p>Extra Dark Mode arrives as an updated variant of what users have experienced before. Now, Nothing states the mode "deepens blacks, improves contrast, and reduces power use across the system." The company's own apps, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> and Launcher support Extra Dark Mode, but Nothing is planning to expand this to even more apps.</p><p>Interactions are another major aspect of Nothing OS 4.0, as Nothing highlights its updated haptic feedback. When adjusting your volume, a "subtle" haptic feedback will alert you to your volume's maximum and minimum. Opening and closing apps should look much smoother than before, while notifications carry "a subtle sense of weight and rebound."</p><h2 id="nothing-os-4-0-highlights-2">Nothing OS 4.0 Highlights</h2><ul><li>More Widget Sizes — Design your home screen your way. New 1×1 and 2×1 layouts for Weather, Pedometer and Screen Time let you build a balanced setup that surfaces what matters most while keeping the space minimal.</li><li>Pop-Up View — You can now open two floating apps at once and switch between them with simple gestures. Swipe up from the bottom to minimize or pull down to expand to full screen.</li><li>Hidden Icons — Keep your layout clean and personal.

And the Charge 6, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M"><strong>has fallen to $99 on Amazon</strong></a> for Black Friday, is Fitbit's newest device that's not a Pixel Watch or kids' watch, making it most likely to sell out first.</p><p>Of course, since we're getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/google-promises-new-fitbit-hardware-in-2026-past-statements-suggest-which">new Fitbit hardware in 2026</a>, you can always try to hold out for a Fitbit Charge 7. But there's reason to get excited now, as Google is completely revamping the Fitbit app to make it more personalized and intelligent. And the sooner you start giving Fitbit data, the more that the new AI coach will have to work with.</p><p>If you're <em>not</em> interested in AI insights, however, then there's no reason to buy a Fitbit Charge 6, or any other Fitbit, no matter how good the prices get. Google has tied Fitbit's future to Gemini, giving it an intelligent advantage that other fitness brands can't match, but <em>you</em> may not care enough about AI to pay for it.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="84e3d84d-6211-48fc-8f57-2c2179e2ab1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$99.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RtTiyhF44bj2uMfaDzxzCe" name="fitbit charge 6 reco 600x600.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtTiyhF44bj2uMfaDzxzCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review" data-dimension112="84e3d84d-6211-48fc-8f57-2c2179e2ab1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$99.95"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>The Fitbit Charge 6 threads the needle between fitness band and smartwatch, with a more usable 1-inch display and better sensors than a Fitbit Inspire 3, but with a lighter design and more reasonable price than a Sense 2.

Just a year of Fitbit Premium — $79 annually or $120 monthly — costs about as much as the Charge 6 itself, which is a deal-<em>breaker</em> for plenty of folks.</p><p>That still applies today, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/new-fitbit-personal-health-coach-preview-arrives-tomorrow-heres-how-it-works">Fitbit Personal Health Coach</a> ensures you're not paying for health data alone; you're paying for analysis and suggestions, too.</p><p>With the new version of the app, you "talk" to a Gemini-trained LLM Coach about your goals, which can be as generic as losing weight or as specific as training for a race in 10 weeks or hitting a weightlifting threshold.

It's obviously as prone to mistakes as any AI LLM, but it's also more targeted than simply asking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> because it can pull from your entire Fitbit health history for context, as well as "10,000+ Google Research publications."

It's only available on Android phones for Premium subscribers in the United States to start, but the beta will launch more widely by the end of 2025. And the final, stable version will launch on Android and iOS sometime in 2026.</p><p>Some of you may decide to wait for the final, stable version to launch, rather than buy the Fitbit Charge 6 now when it's still using the older Fitbit app. But if you're willing to play with beta software, it's an exciting time to get back into the Fitbit ecosystem.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

a NAS? </h2><p>A NAS, or Network Attached Storage, is a physical piece of hardware that's designed specifically for large file storage. Unlike Cloud storage, which holds your files in some remote location, a NAS enclosure is a physical server in your home that you can access and manage at any time with any device you own.</p><p>NAS servers are more than just glorified flash drives, however. These enclosures boast their own operating systems, RAM, and transfer speed, so you're paying for the hardware just as much as the storage capacity. They aren't for everyone, but if you want the ability to store all of your media in one centralized location, a NAS server is a great buy.</p><h2 id="which-nas-is-best-2">Which NAS is best?</h2><p>Although it depends on your individual needs, we generally recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">Synology DiskStation DS224+</a> as the best NAS for most people.

If you want a first-party leather band for your 45mm Garmin Venu 4, black is your only option. At least it matches everything!</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="choosing-the-right-garmin-venu-4-watch-band-2">Choosing the right Garmin Venu 4 watch band</h2><p>Just like the Garmin Venu 4, almost all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> support universal quick-release bands. You just have to match the right-sized band to the case size of your model. If you've got the 41mm Venu 4, any 18mm quick-release band will fit it. And if you opted for the larger 45mm variant, stick with 22mm quick-release bands for perfect compatibility.</p><p>The Garmin Venu 4 comes with either a silicone or a leather band. Most people usually buy the silicone band set as it's a whole $50 cheaper than the leather strap bundle. If you fall into that category and are looking for an extra band, I suggest grabbing a metal watch band two-pack first. Both the ViCRiOR 18mm set and the GARTOO Metal Bands for Garmin 22mm kit are extremely affordable, priced below $20, and are made of waterproof stainless steel. This means they won't blacken over time, and neither will they get scratched or bent easily. A metal band is the fastest way to elevate any wearable, so don't skip this option!</p><p>Next, if you've still got some extra dough, I suggest getting a fabric band for everyday use. The Garmin Quick Release Bands ComfortFit Fabric comes in both 18mm and 22mm sizes, although the color options differ across sizes. Fabric is a sturdy material, comfortable, and more breathable compared to silicone or leather. The band's length is easily adjustable, which is another bonus. It's sure to alleviate some discomfort when you're working out or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-fitness-heart-rate-steps">getting your daily steps in with the Garmin Venu 4</a>.</p><p>The only drawback of getting Garmin's own first-party bands is that they are expensive. However, if you want the perfect fit, high-quality, and uniform branding, first-party is always the way to go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to them, it remains uncertain if these screens will include other potential improvements, such as support for 10-bit color depth or high-frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimming.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a Samsung leaker, I am basically sure that it will adopt M14 material and Polless screen technology, but I can't guarantee that it will adopt 10bit technology and PWM high-frequency dimming. I advise you not to be too optimistic. https://t.co/WicBrzvunb<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1991420299292864522">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Furthermore, the leak suggests that Samsung could use its new M14 material in its display despite sticking to the same brightness.  These OLED panels with "Color Filter on Encapsulation" (CoE) are said to reduce thickness and power consumption, which could contribute to increased efficiency, resulting in reduced power consumption and enhanced long-term reliability.</p><p>"This is not a good sign. Display brightness has stayed unchanged for several generations, and it inevitably raises suspicion that Samsung has started cutting corners on the screen," Ice Universe added.</p><p>While we might not see a significant increase in brightness to 3,000 nits or more, like the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12, which belong to the 4,500 nits club, Samsung is reportedly planning other enhancements to improve the display of its next flagship series.</p><p>The most exciting rumor for the Galaxy S26 lineup (specifically the Ultra) is the debut of "Flex Magic Pixel" technology, which is a privacy feature that uses AI to electronically narrow viewing angles so that people can peer into your screen, effectively killing the need for physical privacy screen protectors, which dim the display of your device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Meta Quest gamers don't want to play lousy free-to-play games on their phones <em>through the Meta Quest app</em>. Likewise, Ray-Ban or Oakley Meta users have no desire to browse AI slop Instagram reels when they're just trying to connect to their smart glasses.</p><p>Meta needs to return to its roots and provide users with what they want, rather than continuing to inject its unwanted content into unrelated apps. If users really want to browse AI-generated social media, make it a new tab in the Instagram app. If some mobile gamers want to join Horizon Worlds on their phones, make it a separate app.</p><p>Heck, dropping that in the Facebook app makes a lot more sense than it being in the Meta Quest app, especially when putting this content front and center is contributing to lower sales on your own video game platform.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google might be working on changing one of the most familiar parts of your phone: the moment it rings. Recent code found in the Phone by Google app suggests that Android users might soon be able to tag a call as “urgent” and possibly get through someone’s Do Not Disturb mode.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-urgent-expressive-calling-3618392/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> have unearthed a potential feature called Expressive Calling, which could change how we grab someone’s attention when a regular ring won’t cut it.</p><p>The ringing on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is an anxiety-inducing lottery. Is it a spam bot about your car’s extended warranty? Or is it your kid’s school calling with an actual emergency? Many people use Do Not Disturb to avoid distractions and only allow important calls. But if something really matters, calling someone repeatedly isn’t a great solution.</p><p>That’s where Expressive Calling steps in. A teardown of the app shows strings that let you pick a "call reason" before the phone starts ringing, with options ranging from “It's urgent!” to friendlier tags like “News to share” or “Quick question,” complete with emoji.</p><h2 id="dnd-bypass-maybe-2">DND bypass (maybe)</h2><p>If the feature works as expected, the urgent tag could bypass Do Not Disturb, but only if you’re in the person’s contacts. This is important because it prevents unknown callers from disturbing you.</p><p>This feature appears to rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> and SMS permissions, so both sides of the call may need compatible apps or features turned on. Without that support, the call reason might not show at all.</p><p>For users on the receiving end, Android could surface something like “Missed an Urgent Call,”  so you know it wasn’t just a regular call. Make sure you’re using the Google Phone app, since other dialers might not support this feature when it launches.</p><p>As with many unreleased features, this one could change or even be canceled before it’s released. Google hasn’t announced a launch timeline, and early versions of Expressive Calling don’t appear to be live for anyone yet.</p><p>However, the level of detail in the code makes it feel like a feature waiting for its debut, possibly first on Pixel phones before coming to other Android devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Locations I visited and scanned were fully walkable while wearing my headset, making me feel like I was right there.</p><p>Despite the ultra-realistic graphics, Meta has been able to port Hyperspace environments into its fledgling Horizon Worlds Engine, allowing players to share and visit locations together. Better yet, you don't even need a headset to try this out, just the Meta Horizon app from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight&hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-horizon/id1366478176">Apple Appstore</a>.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/hyperscape-worlds-sharing-hangout-friends-metaverse-digital-replicas/">a blog post</a>, Meta explains that all you need to do is visit a Hyperscape world — it can be one of your own or one of the existing Meta-created ones, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/24916576431327058/">Gordon Ramsay's kitchen</a> — then just tap the share link and send it to anyone you want to have join you in the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Previously, everything was rendered via Meta's cloud and streamed live to your headset, but now things are rendered in realtime on the hardware you're using. That means your Quest headset or smartphone is doing all the work, and it ensures that you and your friends get a smooth experience when playing together.</p><p>Meta suggests inviting friends or family who can't visit for the holidays and using that to spend a little quality hangout time with them. Certainly not a terrible idea, if I do say so myself. Meta says it will continue improving this feature and hopes to allow even more than eight people in a future update. If you don't see the share option right away, check back later as Meta is rolling the update out to players in waves.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="160c4629-3dca-4ec2-b4e3-de9cc1a7f001">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2GYMC8H/" data-model-name="Quest 3S" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Meta</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>This year's mind-blowing Meta Quest 3S sale brings it down to an effective <strong>$199</strong>!

The main highlight here is that Matter 1.5 now supports cameras. According to the CSA, this new camera support brings in live video and audio streaming.</p><p>Not only is this something consumers can look forward to, but they can also look ahead to "support for multi-stream configurations, pan-tilt-zoom controls, detection and privacy zones, and flexible storage options."</p><p>On the developer side, the CSA states Matter 1.5 lets devs build their cameras with Matter interoperability without causing friction between their apps and services.</p><p>Another important update in Matter 1.5 is support for closures. This includes window shades, drapes, awnings, gates, and garage doors. The CSA states that, with this update, smart home device creators can now "represent" different motion types for their devices, such as sliding, rotating, and opening. Additionally, they can also set configurations, like single/dual panels and nested mechanisms.</p><p>Users with a green thumb are receiving Soil Sensor support for moisture and temperature information for indoor plants and those outside in gardens.</p><h2 id="pushing-on-looking-ahead-2">Pushing on & looking ahead</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1342px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.04%;"><img id="xYH6UX6urKyMTHecqx8vNX" name="matter-bridge.jpg" alt="Matter Bridge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xYH6UX6urKyMTHecqx8vNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1342" height="1007" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a related note, the CSA states Matter 1.5 is advancing its energy management capabilities. The update enables devices "to exchange standardized information about energy pricing, tariffs, and grid carbon intensity."</p><p>The Matter 1.5 SDK, testing tools, and more are available for Alliance members. Essentially, it's now just a waiting game for consumers until they begin noticing these new capabilities with their smart home products.</p><p>Around this time last year, the CSA launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">the Matter 1.4 upgrade</a>, which brought in support for more devices like water heaters and heat pumps, and improved thermostat support for preset modes. It was a timely update since we were moving into those colder days, and it also marked the arrival of Device Energy Management for electric vehicles. Several months later, in May 2025, the CSA introduced the "minor" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-1-minor-release-smart-home-setup-easy">Matter 1.4.1 update</a>.</p><p>This update was all about improving the setup process for the consumer through Multi-Device Setup QR Codes and Onboarding Info in NFC tags.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It also makes audio products, and it collaborated with Bose earlier this year to roll out the Inspire range, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/ditch-your-sony-this-bose-powered-headset-is-better">XH1 headset</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/baseus-bose-powered-inspire-xp1-earbuds-dolby-audio-and-a-standout-sound">XP1 earbuds</a>.</p><p>The XH1 headset in particular is terrific; it sounds very similar to Bose's QuietComfort headsets, and that's because the sound is tuned by Bose. The design itself is nearly identical to Bose headsets, but because this is ultimately a Baseus product, you don't have to pay anywhere as much.

Other than that, the XH1 doesn't really miss a beat; the headset has a stylish design and is comfortable even with all-day use, the battery easily lasts 50 hours — much more than Bose and Sony — and it's even available in interesting color variants.</p><p>It's the sound quality where the XH1 stands out the most; the headset has thoroughly engaging bass, along with a clean mid-range and decent treble. While I wouldn't say it sounds as good as my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset, it comes mighty close, and that alone is a big deal considering the XH1 costs just one-fourth as much.</p><p>The battery life is phenomenal, and it lasts longer than any other headset I own. It doesn't get dust and water resistance, so in that sense, it is similar to other Bose headsets. However, when you consider the cost — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XH1-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0FLPYQ693">particularly at $99</a> — and the build quality along with the design and terrific sound, there's no question that you're getting one of the best headsets in this category.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you upload a picture with Google’s hidden SynthID watermark, Gemini will spot it and let you know it’s AI-generated, as per the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-image-verification-gemini-app/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. It’s a faster version of the browser-based SynthID Detector Google launched earlier this year, which required manual uploads.</p><p>Google has been embedding invisible watermarks into images produced by its AI models, including the recently added Nano Banana Pro model used inside Gemini, Google Ads, and Vertex AI. These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-are-content-credentials">images also carry C2PA metadata</a>, an industry-backed format that reveals how a piece of media was created or altered. With these two layers, Google wants to make AI content easier to trace as it moves across the web, especially when it gets reposted, remixed, or wrapped in misleading narratives.</p><p>Building SynthID directly into the Gemini app is Google’s attempt to bring this provenance data out of the developer world and into something regular people might actually when browsing the web.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:653px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.87%;"><img id="TPhnUGsPS3HitkybQFcrU7" name="Gemini-AI-detector" alt="AI image detector in Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPhnUGsPS3HitkybQFcrU7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="653" height="515" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-critical-limitation-2">A critical limitation</h2><p>However, it’s important to remember that this system only works if everyone uses it. Right now, Gemini can’t spot AI images made by other companies’ tools.</p><p>So, while this update is useful, it isn’t a complete solution. It makes it easier to check images made with Google’s tools and encourages more transparency in the industry, but it doesn’t replace basic skepticism when you encounter a picture that looks a little too convenient. For this system to truly work, other platforms also need to use the same standards and make detection as easy as posting a photo online.</p><p>Google says it plans to expand detection to search results, audio, and video next, but the bigger leap will come when these tools work across the entire internet, not just inside a single company’s garden.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Although it isn't a consideration, the Amp Ultra has a gorgeous design, and it connects to all major streaming platforms. <br></p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need AirPlay. I don't know why the Amp Ultra doesn't have it, and it is an annoying omission.</p><p>The Amp Ultra has an all-metal chassis with an industrial design that looks great, and the amp stands out for all the right reasons. I use the 3.5-inch panel all the time, and there's a large multifunction rotary knob. The bundled remote is pretty great too, and from a design point of view, WiiM hasn't put a foot wrong.</p><p>Coming to the audio, the Amp Ultra delivers 100W on each channel at 8Ω, going up to200W at 4Ω. I didn't have any issues driving the Wharfedale Linton with the amp, and the ESS 9039Q2M Sabre DAC ensures you get great sound. What I like is that there's built-in integration with all music streaming platforms, and it has room correction that makes a difference.</p><p>You get multi-room sound as well if that's of interest, and WiiM's mobile app has a minimalist interface with plenty of customizability. The Amp Ultra is basically one of my favorite home audio devices, and if you've been waiting on a deal, now is the time to act while it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Streaming-Amplifier-ES9039Q2M-Touchscreen/dp/B0F995W2NG">still available for just $423</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As the buds don't nuzzle into your ear canal, you don't feel any pressure while wearing these at all, and they're great for all-day use. On that note, the battery life is terrific, lasting up to nine hours between charges. They're just as good in daily use as working out.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want noise isolation. Because of the design, you don't quite get the same level of noise isolation — these buds are meant to filter in sounds from your immediate vicinity. They don't have AptX codecs, so you miss out on high-res audio.</p><p>I mostly wear open earbuds these days, as they're just much more comfortable. The clip-on style of the OpenDots One means they do stand out quite a bit, but the upside is that you get a good fit that doesn't cause any pressure even with all-day use. The buds are light, and as they're positioned outside the ear canal, you can make out ambient sounds to an extent.</p><p>Other than noise isolation not being on the same level as the equivalent Bose and Sony earbuds, I don't have any issues with the OpenDots One. The fit is great, the sound quality is astonishingly good thanks to dual audio drivers — it's much better than I imagined — and they have a pronounced low-end that just adds to the vibrancy of the sound. You can also easily tweak the audio to your tastes, and there's no sound leakage, so you won't be disturbing anyone if you blast heavy metal during your commute.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hEaawGLBk9xC9nK5xZT4Hc" name="Shokz OpenDots One" alt="Shokz OpenDots One on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEaawGLBk9xC9nK5xZT4Hc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and did I mention they're light? The buds weigh just 6.5g, and most of the time, I didn't even notice I was wearing these. While I was initially hesitant about the fit, I didn't have any issues in this area — they stay put even while running or working out in general. You get IP54 dust and water resistance, and they're ideally suited for workouts. While you don't get the best noise isolation, I actually found it to be a good thing; I wouldn't take these on a flight, but for every other situation, they're pretty great.</p><p>The buds are interchangeable, so you can wear these on either ear, and they connect via Bluetooth 5.4. I didn't see any issues pairing the buds with my Pixel 10 Pro and Find X9 Pro, and they connect to two devices at once. The case itself is easily pocketable, and it gets Qi charging as well in addition to USB-C. The only omission is AptX; you're limited to SBC and AAC, so you miss out on high-res audio.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

much better than most regular buds. There's fast charging as well, giving you two hours of music playback with a 10-minute charge, and the case provides 30 hours worth of power — so you'll only need to charge the case once a week (that's what I did).</p><p>To sum up, the OpenDots One have been nothing short of wonderful. The comfortable fit is the main reason I like these so much, but that doesn't take away from the great sound quality either. I like the battery life and IP54 ingress protection as well, and on the whole, these are among the best open earbuds I used until now. The fact that they're on sale at $139 makes the earbuds a much more enticing choice.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But if you don't need a full-size controller and are looking to play games on the go, the X5 Lite is a better choice. It is considerably smaller and lighter than the G8 Plus, and as it connects over USB-C, you don't need to worry about the battery running out.</p><p>The controller usually costs $35, which is pretty great in its own right. But now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joystick-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller-Smartphone/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">get it for just $27 on Amazon</a>, making it one of the most affordable mobile gaming controllers you can buy today.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="46f2bcd2-3325-438b-9b20-5a8c6b009a04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The X5 Lite is the obvious choice if you just need a reliable mobile gaming controller you can take anywhere.

The X5 Lite has good build quality, great buttons and triggers, anti-drift joysticks, and is generally a great bargain.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Bluetooth gaming controller.</p><p>The X5 Lite comes in at just 135g, making it a great choice as a portable gaming controller. Connecting over USB-C means there's no problem pairing it with just about any Android phone, and I used it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> without any issues. Where the controller has an edge over its costlier siblings is that it easily accommodates phones with huge camera islands, and this in itself made me want to use the X5 Lite more.</p><p>It also has an extending bridge that lets you slot in phones and tablets with ease, and the build quality is terrific — I didn't see any problems after three months of use. Interestingly, the controller gets USB-C passthrough charging as well, so you can easily charge your phone while using it. As it connects over USB-C, you can use it with newer iPhones and iPads in addition to Android tablets, and there isn't anything to configure as such.</p><p>Coming to the buttons, you get the standard ABXY cluster along with a D pad, hall effect joysticks, and shoulder-mounted triggers, and the buttons have good tactility. The joysticks are easily the best of any mobile controller in this category, and while it is on the smaller side, it isn't uncomfortable to hold in the least — GameSir did a good job in this regard.</p><p>Overall, the X5 Lite is a hassle-free mobile gaming controller that excels at the basics. It misses out on some of the extras you get with the X5s or the G8 models, but the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joystick-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller-Smartphone/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">it costs just $27</a> makes it an unbeatable value.</p> ]]></dc:content>
