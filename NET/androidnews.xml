<ul><li>Samsung previewed what was on the way for the Galaxy Buds 3 series in One UI 7.</li><li>The company states users will find a more “intelligent” audio experience as the Buds “analyze” your surroundings to optimize your listening.</li><li>Samsung did not state when One UI 7 could arrive, especially after its phones were hit with yet another major delay.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>To end the week, Samsung showcased a few of the new features on the way for its Galaxy Buds 3 series with the next major One UI update.</p><p>In a press release, Samsung states its One UI 7 update for the Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro is designed to provide the best “audio experience” for users. Additionally, the company is interested in making its audio more “intelligent.” To achieve this, the post highlights its first new feature: Tailor Sound. This concerns personal hearing needs with the company stating it has updated its Adapt Sound tool with an expansion of ambient sound capabilities.</p><p>Samsung says this should make listening to music and the like more accurate and clear when on a video or voice call. It’s worth noting that the Adaptive Sound feature is only available on the Buds 3 Pro.</p><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/galaxy-buds3-series-offers-enhanced-convenience-on-the-galaxy-s25-series">blog post</a>, the company says users will find an “advanced hearing test” to help the software create a personalized sound profile for you. However, if you’d rather not go through the hoops, Samsung will provide three preset profiles from which you can select the best option.</p><p>Next, Samsung introduced its upgraded optimized sound functionality. The post states the mics within the Galaxy Buds 3 series will “analyze” sound externally and internally to optimize what you’re hearing and its ANC capabilities (active noise cancellation). The Adaptive Noise Control is said to gauge your surroundings to automatically alter sound without the user’s input.</p><p>Samsung’s One UI 7 update for the Galaxy Buds 3 series is also bringing a few QoL (quality of life) updates. The first concerns personalizing the audio for specific apps. With One UI 7, users will be able to set their preferred audio settings for individual apps via the Quick Settings Panel. The Korean OEM says these altered settings will be applied automatically and put to use whenever the app you’ve altered is opened.</p><p>The Quick Settings Panel on your Galaxy phone is also gaining access to the Galaxy Wearables app. Samsung states from there, users can alter their wearable settings from their phone without needing to access the app separately. Lastly, the One UI 7 update brings additional interpretation aid via Galaxy AI. Through Listening Mode, your Galaxy Buds will pick up support for 20 extra languages for translations during conversations with users with a different native tongue.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Samsung still hasn’t given us an idea of when we can expect One UI 7 to roll out — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">on smartphones, that is</a>. The major OS has received its lumps for the past few months and it was reported that another delay was in the cards. Reports flooded in regarding Samsung’s “Natural” mode screen optimization feature. According to users, it was causing the screen to become far yellower than intended.</p><p>Samsung was forced to take back its patch and work to fix it. That forecast came true a few weeks later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">when One UI 7 Beta 5 arrived</a> in mid-February. That update came swiftly after its fourth beta hit just days before. Regardless, the fifth update features even more fixes and a solution to a crash bug plaguing the Visual Voicemail app.</p><p><br>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">stated in a blog post</a> that One UI 7 was coming “imminently.” This post was published in mid-January. The company said the update would arrive on Galaxy devices sometime during Q1 2025, which leaves only March.</p>

<ul><li>Google recently published a dedicated “Devices” page for consumers, letting them view every product they own from the OEM.</li><li>The page gives users insight into their device names, serial/IMEI numbers, and access to support for products they’ve “signed in to.”</li><li>Access to Find My Device network for phones was also spotted, giving users full access to location, locking, and sound capabilities for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly rolled out a QoL update via its online store, letting consumers see insights about every owned product.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/27/google-store-devices-page/#more-663278">9to5Google</a>, the company recently published a new dedicated “Devices” page on the Google Store for products consumers own. The page states users can “manage” all “Made by Google hardware in one place.” By default, the page displays all of your owned devices; however, there are several tabs in case users can specifically see their phones, earbuds, tablets, watches & trackers, and smart home products.</p><p>When viewing your devices, the page will display them with the appropriate product picture (and selected color) alongside its name. If you’ve named your device, your custom name will show instead of Google’s name for the product.</p><p>The page also details information about your warranty and the date for when/if it already expired.</p><p>Users can view their device’s SN (serial number) or IMEI number if it’s a phone, as noted by the publication. The cards feature a “View More” button, which brings you a device-specific page. This lists similar details as the hard with the addition of when you purchased it. Users can quickly access Google Support from there about the device in question.</p><p>Google has included an “Add a device” option. The company states devices you’ve “signed into” — which are those tied directly to your account — will automatically appear on this new page. However, users can manually add “other devices to manage, but they may have limited functionality.” To do this, users will need that other product’s IMEI or serial number. If this is something you require, Google suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/15938919?visit_id=01740768021397-8122275873028872310&p=your_devices&rd=1">checking out its support page</a> for more details.</p><p>As a side note, the publication noticed users could utilize Google’s Find My Device network when viewing a phone from the Device pages. It seems the page gives users the full Find My Device experience, meaning you can find, lock, or force your lost phone to make a chime.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">started rolling out</a> the Find My Device network for Android devices in the spring of 2024. The service was starting to appear on more devices for those in the U.S. and out on phones like the Pixel 8 and the Moto Razr Plus. One of the standouts of the feature was exclusive to the Pixel 8 series: the ability to locate the phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-explains-pixel-8-find-my-device-powered-off">even when powered off</a>. Users were encouraged to toggle their Bluetooth and location services on before their phone lost power or was turned off.</p><p>Your powered-off Pixel would still transmit its location for “several hours.” As expected, the Pixel 9 series has retained this offline relocation capability through Find My Device.</p>

<ul><li>Google has leased a 7,000-square-foot location in Washington, D.C. that will become a Google Store later this year.</li><li>It'll be the eighth Google Store in the U.S., and the first in the nation's capitol.</li><li>There are three other Google Stores in the works, with a Santa Monica location set to open March 7.</li></ul>

<p>Compared to Apple or Samsung, Google's retail footprint for its Pixel, Nest, and Fitbit devices is relatively small. While the company's products are available in a wide variety of third-party stores, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-to-expand-retail-footprint-with-austin-texas-store-on-the-way">only a handful of Google Store locations</a> in the U.S. Google has been improving on that in recent years, and a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.costar.com/article/31146599/google-search-leads-to-its-first-brick-and-mortar-store-in-dc-area" target="_blank">CoStar</a> , a real estate publication, says that the company's eighth store will be opening in Washington, D.C. this year.</p><p>The news comes from EastBanc, a commercial real estate developer that owns the approximately 7,000 square feet of space that Google picked for its next Google Store location.  The store, which will be located at 3235 M St. NW in the Georgetown neighborhood of D.C., is part of a 10-year lease, according to the report.</p><p>There are currently five Google Stores open for business, and they're concentrated in New York and California. The company also operates stores in Massachusetts and Illinois, which opened in 2024. Google was on track to open two stores in 2025, with those locations being previously announced. Now, the Washington, D.C. store is set to be Google's third retail location in the pipeline. It could open three Google Stores this year, bringing its nationwide total to eight, assuming there are no hiccups.</p>

<p>Google Store locations give potential customers the opportunity to learn more about Google's hardware offerings, with some hands-on elements. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel</a>, Nest, and Fitbit brands are just a few that typically have a prominent place in a Google Store. The company also offers repair and support options, which are crucial if it wants to seriously compete with Samsung and Apple's expansive retail and support networks.</p><p>Aside from the newly-reported Washington, D.C. location, there are Google Store locations planned for Santa Monica, California and Austin, Texas. The retail spot in Santa Monica is set to open March 7, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/us/magazine/locations?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Google's website</a>. Currently, all we know about the Austin store is that it'll be part of the Domain Northside retail hub, located at 11701 Domain Blvd.</p><p>Google is ramping up Google Store developments after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-nyc-store-first-look">opening the first one in Chelsea in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>While it's always exciting to compare the most expensive flagship phones, the midrange sector is arguably more competitive than ever. Apple's newest iPhone 16e is effectively a successor to the third-generation iPhone SE, and it tries to offer a pared-down iPhone 16 experience at the $600 price point. That makes it a fitting competitor to Google's Pixel 8a, a midrange Android smartphone available for $500 with plenty of powerful AI features.</p><p>There are a few reasons to consider avoiding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, but they all involve buying another midrange Android phone. The phone's successor, the Pixel 9a, is almost certainly set to arrive next month — and current Android midrangers like the OnePlus 13R could be a better value. But how does the Pixel 8a shake up when put directly against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16e-just-beat-google-and-samsung-to-the-punch">iPhone 16e</a>? That's what we're here to find out.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-8a-vs-iphone-16e-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 8a vs. iPhone 16e: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iYiFZ2kfrjYSPRaxDjuh6B" name="google-pixel-8a-homescreen-04.jpg" alt="The colorful home screen of the Google Pixel 8a under some flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iYiFZ2kfrjYSPRaxDjuh6B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google and Apple took similar approaches in designing the Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. They're both closely related to past Pixel or iPhone flagships, while lacking some of the newer design choices or premium materials found on the latest models. Both phones are also slightly smaller than their flagship companions. The Pixel 8a has a 6.1-inch screen, smaller than the 6.2-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>. Meanwhile, the iPhone 16e also has a 6.1-inch screen, and that's smaller than the 6.12-inch iPhone 16.</p><p>The small form factor may be ideal for people who enjoy compact flagships. In that respect, the iPhone 16e is the smaller choice, measuring 146.7mm x 71.5mm x 7.80mm. By comparison, the Pixel 8a is bigger by every measurement, but its thickness is something specifically worth watching out for. Google's midranger measures 152.1 mm x 72.7 mm x 8.9 mm — that's over a millimeter thicker than the iPhone 16e.</p><p>Apple's midranger is considerably lighter, too, weighing just 167 grams. That makes the 188-gram Pixel 8a feel like a giant. This is especially odd when you consider that the Pixel has a plastic back and the iPhone has a glass back. In terms of design and build, the Pixel does have the advantage of comfort. Its curvy, pebble-shaped build conforms nicely to your hand without issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE" name="iphone-16e-side-view-render" alt="iPhone 16e side profile render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHGz9BYP7932QkqQcEJJaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1120" height="630" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moving to the displays, the Google Pixel 8a has the definitive edge. It has a 6.1-inch AMOLED panel with support for HDR10+ color and a 1,400-nit peak brightness rating. That's better in every way than the iPhone 16e's display, which has an OLED panel but only supports 60Hz refresh rate and a 1,200-nit peak brightness rating. Additionally, the iPhone 16e has a big notch at the top of the screen, whereas the Pixel 8a has a small hole-punch cutout.</p><p>In terms of durability, both phones are rated for IP68 dust and water-resistance. Google uses Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, while Apple is using its own Ceramic Shield glass. Both devices feature an aluminum construction and a USB-C port for connectivity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ" name="google-pixel-8a-blue-with-flowers-01.jpg" alt="The blue Google Pixel 8a on a tea tray with blue hydrangeas above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tcayRk63cRY9xtVSBnnQQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That about sums up the design differences between the Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. The former might have slightly larger display bezels than the latter, but that won't matter since the iPhone 16e has that big notch anyway. The iPhone 16e has the edge in compactness and weight, but the Pixel 8a gets the display win.</p>

<p>Midrange phones usually come with a few compromises, with the processor often being one of them. That's true of the Google Pixel 8a and the iPhone 16e. Both phones are incredibly capable, supporting Google AI and Apple Intelligence respectively, but they won't stack up to flagship-level chips. Google uses the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3 chip</a> here as the rest of the Pixel 8 series. At first glance, it might look like Apple uses the same A18 chip as the iPhone 16, but the iPhone 16e actually has a binned version of the chip with one fewer graphics core.</p><p>What does that all mean? In simple terms, it means that neither midrange phone will be able to hang with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. But you probably already could've guessed that from their prices. The important part is that both phones support their respective AI suites, Gemini Nano on-device and Apple Intelligence (with Visual Intelligence via the Action button).</p>

<p>Google likely offers the edge in software support, as the Pixel 8a is guaranteed seven years of OS updates. It's already gotten the boost to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and has been upgraded with new Circle to Search and Gemini features. Of course, it's not guaranteed to get every new feature, but the Pixel 8a has a solid foundation.</p><p>While Apple has a good <em>reputation</em> for software support, it doesn't provide a <em>guarantee</em>. Additionally, even the year-old iPhone 15 didn't get Apple Intelligence, so it's unclear how Apple's software support could be affected by the fast-moving pace of AI progress.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5C2GJycwViaKNcc7kiCKMJ" name="google-pixel-8a-camera-bar-bay-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5C2GJycwViaKNcc7kiCKMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Neither the Google Pixel 8a or the iPhone 16e have the best camera system on a smartphone, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a appears to be closest to flagship-caliber</a>. Google's using a 64MP main camera sensor with an f/1.89 aperture and optical-image stabilization. With sensor crop, it can provide 2x optical zoom quality, with digital zoom beyond that. There's also a secondary 13MP ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view to round out the dual-camera system.</p><p>That's one more camera when than the iPhone 16e has. Apple tries to use one camera sensor that's versatile enough to serve as a main, ultrawide, and telephoto lens. It's a 48MP, f/1.6 lens with OIS capable of shooting either 24MP or 48MP photos. Like the Pixel 8a, it uses sensor crop to mimic a 2x telephoto. Make no mistake, though: while this single camera is likely impressive, it won't match the performance of a good dual or triple-camera system.</p><p>On the front, the Pixel 8a uses a wide 13MP, f/2.2 sensor. By comparison, the iPhone 16e has a 12MP camera with an f/1.9 aperture. Both front-facing cameras will get the job done. In terms of security, the Pixel 8a has both a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-ultrasonic-fingerprint-sensors-just-dont-work-for-me">fingerprint sensor</a> and facial recognition, whereas the iPhone only has Face ID.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2GGLDfEEsMSm5CsFNG7XEH" name="google-pixel-8a-back-bay-02.jpg" alt="The Google Pixel 8a in the Bay blue colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GGLDfEEsMSm5CsFNG7XEH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After breaking down the specs between the iPhone 16e and the Google Pixel 8a, it's clear that the latter provides more for $500 than the former does for $600. However, I still wouldn't recommend buying the Pixel 8a at its full MSRP — considering it's nearly a year old and the Pixel 9a is on the way.</p><p>Instead, look to buy the Pixel 8a for even cheaper than its $500 sticker price, which will make it that much better of a value than the iPhone 16e. Right now, the Pixel 8a is $100 off when you activate it with a carrier at Best Buy. The deals will almost certainly get better after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> is released, so waiting a few weeks to see what's new could be a solid plan.</p><p>The iPhone 16e's value proposition is tricky, making it difficult to recommend for anyone except those who absolutely <em>must</em> have an iPhone on a sub-$600 budget. Even then, I'd argue that it's worth looking into an older — perhaps even refurbished or renewed — flagship iPhone instead.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>For the iOS lovers out there</strong></em></p><p>It's somewhat difficult to recommend the iPhone 16e to buyers, unless you only have $600 to spend and really want an iPhone. Otherwise, the iPhone 16e's limitations — including the 60Hz, notched display and the lack of MagSafe — loom large. It's better than the iPhone SE it replaces in the iPhone lineup, but gets crushed by $600 Android phones. </p></p>

While the display is LCD and not AMOLED, it's still super bright and has a 120Hz refresh rate, along with being pretty aesthetically-pleasing to use. The Moto G also features over 24 hours of battery life and takes just an hour to charge with a 30W charger, though you'll have to buy that separately.</p>

<hr>
<p>TECNO is firing up the teaser engine once again, but this time the company is showcasing an upcoming, razor-thin smartphone.</p><p>The company<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tecnomobile/status/1895398536558121221"> teased the device on X</a> showcasing what’s coming up at MWC 2025: TECNO’s SPARK Slim. The OEM posted a trio of photos, showing off just how thin the device is. In comparison to a pencil or a CD case, the SPARK Slim is vastly thinner; however, TECNO confirms the phone measures only 5.57mm thick. It remains unclear if this factors in its camera bump, which could take things up a bit.</p><p>Regardless, TECNO continues by highlighting the phone’s “futuristic design.” The silvery phone features rounded corners and relatively flat sides, given how thin the device is said to be. Additionally, TECNO draws attention to its camera housing, which appears to be a dual camera configuration in a pill-shaped bar. It seems very Pixel-esque, especially when you consider the look/feel of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series’ bar</a>.</p><p>TECNO states the SPARK Slim’s dual camera bar will consist of two 50MP lenses. The teaser didn’t expand on what cameras we could see, but perhaps we’re looking at a primary and ultrawide situation.</p><p>Elsewhere, the SPARK Slim is confirmed to have a 6.7-inch 3D Curved AMOLED display. To help you surge through the day will be a 5,200mAh “plus” battery.</p>

<p>As previously stated, this is a teaser to get consumers riled up for TECNO’s MWC 2025 appearance in Barcelona at Booth 6B11.</p><p>The Chinese OEM is preparing to showcase quite a few things as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-advanced-skin-tone-phantom-ultimate-2-mwc-2025-teaser">recently revealed plans</a> for more AI and a device prototype. Part of its latest wave of photo “advancements,” TECNO said it is looking to enhance the skin tone recognition of its mobile imaging software. A press release detailed TECNO’s work at expanding its Skin Tone Database to accomplish the goal of “true-to-life representation” for a wealth of tones. TECNO is backing its Multi Skin Tone Card with the skin tone restoration engine to ensure all skin tones are “precise” and vibrant, even in challenging photography scenarios.</p><p>The major device prototype we’re waiting on is confirmed to be the Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold. TECNO claims the foldable is “ultra-thin” and features a Starry Optical Fiber material. MWC 2025 attendees may have a chance to see this slim foldable on the floor around TECNO’s area.</p><p>Interestingly, TECNO originally teased a super thin Phantom Ultimate 2 tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">back in 2024</a> during that year’s MWC. Consumers didn’t get a chance to see the device up close or behind glass as TECNO only highlighted it in teaser imagery and videos. The original concept material teased a phone with a 6.48-inch cover display and a 10-inch 3K OLED internal screen.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-what-to-expect">MWC 2025</a> is gearing up to run from March 3 through March 6.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google is working to change the SMS code authentication used to sign into a Google account to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gmail-sms-qr-code-swap-confirmed-report">have you scan a QR code</a>. Besides the several severe flaws with this idea, it's still good that Google is trying to make proving who we are a little more streamlined and less nerdy. If it weren't such a pain to do it, more services would offer MFA (multi-factor authentication), and more of us would use it.</p><p>Google's not alone here. Microsoft, Apple, and organizations like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">FIDO Alliance</a> are working on the issue, too. These companies know that it's something that benefits everyone, and it needs to be done in a simple yet effective way.</p>
<p>Before discussing Google's new idea, you need to know what authentication is. I can tell you who I am and that is me providing my <strong>identity</strong>. That will never change and I will always be me even if I change my name. I'm still this person.</p><p>But sometimes I need to prove it and <strong>authenticate</strong> that I am who I say I am because it's super easy for me to lie. You don't want Joe Random to have access to your bank or other online account so proof is mandatory.</p><p>There are three types of authentication, and for a service to be secure it needs to use at least two. Using two methods lowers the chance that I'm someone else just trying to get into Jerry's account.</p><p><strong>Knowledge:</strong> Something only the real Jerry would know, like a password or a PIN.<br><strong>Ownership:</strong> Something only the real Jerry has, like an ID card or a software token on a phone.<br><strong>Inherence:</strong> Something the real Jerry is or does, like supplying a fingerprint or a retina scan.</p><p>You'll always need to use a password or PIN for one type of authentication, but for something to be considered secure, you need to use one of the other two types. That's where things can get messy.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3413px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Ki6VkQ9S5YboYwKkaNYP4W" name="google-lens-search-with-camera.JPG" alt="Google Lens Search with your camera function" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ki6VkQ9S5YboYwKkaNYP4W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3413" height="1919" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google thinks it would be better and easier to show you a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-read-qr-code-your-android-phones-camera">QR code</a> you can scan to supply proof of ownership than send you an SMS message. It would definitely be more secure because SMS messages aren't difficult to spoof or "hack" into.</p><p>It also has two potential problems I can spot: it can require two devices and may only work seamlessly if you use an up-to-date Android phone. I'll give you a worst-case example:</p><p>I buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-xl">iPhone 16 Pro Max,</a> and I want to sign into my Gmail account. I can't use an authenticator app because I need access to set one up or switch to a new one in my Google account, so I have to use the fallback method. Google then shows me a QR code. A QR code on the screen of the <strong>only device I have</strong> and the one I'm trying to use to sign into my account. Can you spot the problem here?</p><p>The secondary problem is, what if I do have a QR code scanner on my new iPhone and scan the code? What happens next? If I have an Android phone with the latest version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-play-services">Google Services</a> installed, the process can be whisked away and handled automatically. It could be done through something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, so it works with one device.</p><p>Since I am trying to do this on my iPhone, I just have to use the fallback for the fallback and get an SMS. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-time-stop-using-services-force-you-use-sms-based-two-factor-authentication">SMS authentication is insecure</a>, but it's necessary. It makes sense to use this for Android phones and a Google account. Not so much for other devices.</p>
<p>This is the real problem with authentication. It's always going to require some extra steps, and those extra steps can be a pain in the you-know-what. Using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/display-fingerprint-sensors-and-cold-weather-could-mean-problems">fingerprint scan</a> — something that never changes and is your identity, not a means of authentication — was a big step towards making all this less messy. Unfortunately, you can't use the fingerprint until you have it set up and Gmail doesn't support using it to get into your account for the first time.</p><p>I don't know how you "fix" this, but I do know that really smart people are working on it. We've seen things progress from an on-device keychain that holds auth methods to fingerprint scans, to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-brings-passkeys-to-android-and-chrome">Passkeys</a>, and now QR codes. Keeping SMS as a fallback option is smart, too, because every device with a phone number can get one.</p><p>Google still has yet to reveal all the details of how this will work, so we will likely hear more about it before it rolls out. In any case, we have reached out to Google for more information and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>I think this will be fixed, even though I don't know how. Then, we will have to wait until every service we want to use adopts safe and simple authentication methods.</p>

<p>When you've used as many phones as I have over the years, there are some that tend to stick in your memory better than others. Apple's release of the iPhone 3GS sparked my love for smartphones, while jailbreaking laid the foundation for when I would later join the world of Android and rooting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review">Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> was my first experience with a foldable phone, and now I don't leave home without one.</p><p>Although I had been hoping for Google to release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the original Pixel Fold didn't quite do it for me. Instead, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> captured my heart as it set the standard for what I think a book-style foldable phone should offer.</p><p>At the time, it was thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> with larger screens while offering better battery life, faster charging, better cameras, and the list goes on. Sure, it lacked wireless charging, and I had to jump through hoops trying to find the right stylus. But hey, it got everything else right. So much so that I didn't want to stop using it even as newer and more powerful phones came my way.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to predecessor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, not all dreams are meant to be granted, and this is the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">OnePlus Open 2</a>. Following the news that it would not launch in 2025, I was rather dejected and wanted to figure out how to get my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>. But without carrier subsidies to rely on, paying extra just to have it imported isn't currently on the cards.</p><p>So, instead, I wanted to see if the Open was still as good as I thought or if I was just living in the proverbial "reality distortion field."</p><p>Fast forward a week or so, and I think I've found myself stuck between fantasy and reality. From a hardware perspective, it's a pretty tight race between the OnePlus Open and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. That's a testament to both OnePlus and Google, as the Open was released in October 2023, while the 9 Pro Fold feels incredibly more modern than its predecessor.</p><p>The Open didn't fall short in terms of performance, which, again, is no surprise. It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and includes 16GB of RAM. Would I have wanted to see a OnePlus foldable with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>? Absolutely, but that's more of a feeling rooted in me wanting the fastest and most powerful phone possible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="nwoQLQvnNWYC4tzy8W9wW7" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-12.jpg" alt="App Drawer multitasking from OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwoQLQvnNWYC4tzy8W9wW7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the software, well, it's exactly what you'd expect from a OnePlus or OPPO phone. All of the "normal" stuff works fine, but I didn't come away feeling the same about multitasking. Don't get me wrong, I think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">Open Canvas</a> is fantastic in a lot of ways, especially on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a>. However, I also think that I still prefer Samsung's split-screen approach because of the way that I use foldables.</p><p>When it comes to the cameras, not much has really changed, as I still think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-z-fold-6-and-oneplus-open-camera-against-mother-nature-the-results-were-unexpected">it beats Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> in that regard. It's not better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra or iPhone 16 Pro Max, but it's right up there with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Of course, these all fall short when compared to foldable phones released in regions that aren't the U.S., but I digress.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There was one thing that's really left a thorn in my side since I started using the Open again — battery life. It's just bad. Initially, I thought it was because I was switching over from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. That's a new phone with a new battery, while I was switching to a phone from 2023 with a battery that has really been put through the wringer.</p><p>But then it got worse. Since moving my spare SIM over to the Open a little over a week ago, I've been unable to make it through an entire day without needing to recharge before bed. I don't mean that the phone's running out of juice an hour or two before. I mean that I take it off the charger between 7-8 AM in the morning, and I'm down to 20% or lower by 4-5 PM.</p><p>It's reached the point that I actually couldn't wait to be done using the Open so I could flip a coin and go back to either the Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Galaxy Z Fold 6. And for the first time in who knows how long, I actually wish a modern phone had a user-<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-removable-battery">replaceable battery</a>. Just let me swap it out or take it somewhere to be done in a day or two, and everything would be golden. Which isn't exactly something that I'd expect to say in 2025.</p>

<p>When it's all said and done, I think that at that moment, the OnePlus Open was the best thing since sliced bread. In a lot of ways, it still holds up, to the point that I'd be happy even if OnePlus were to just re-release it. Oh right, that already kind of happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">Apex Edition</a> that you can no longer buy.</p><p>For as much as I wanted to fall in love with the OnePlus Open again, that "spark" just isn't there for me. Maybe I will try to figure out a way to replace the battery and give it another shot.

<ul><li>Gemini is gaining another Gemini Advanced feature — this time it's saved information.</li><li>You can tell Gemini a few things about yourself to help better inform its responses in a way that's personalized to you.</li><li>The feature is starting to become available for free Gemini users, but is not widely rolled out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has earned a reputation for steadily migrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> features to Gemini's free tier, and that continues with the rollout of Gemini's "saved info" tool — becoming available now for free users. While not fully rolled out yet, the feature has been spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1izm0h1/gemini_added_saving_info_to_free_users/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a> on the Gemini web client and was first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/gemini-saved-info-free/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>Saved information in Gemini essentially serves as a basic memory that can help the AI assistant deliver more personalized responses. "Share info about your life and preferences to get more helpful response," the company explains. "Add new info here or ask Gemini to remember something during a chat."</p><p>Previously, Gemini's saved info tab was only available for Gemini Advanced users and locked behind the $20 per month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium plan</a>. It's still restricted to the English language only, but it is now starting to appear for free users. Gemini users may see a pop-up explaining that the feature is available, or can manually find it by opening the <strong>Gemini sidebar</strong>, selecting the <strong>Settings gear</strong>, and clicking <strong>Saved info</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2930px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="CCVzKZbpDbPay2jw76qg6Y" name="Gemini-Advanced-Saved-Info" alt="The saved info section of Gemini's web client." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCVzKZbpDbPay2jw76qg6Y.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2930" height="1640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google shares a few examples of the type of information that Gemini might find helpful:</p>
<ul><li>Use simple language and avoid jargon</li><li>I’m vegetarian, so don’t suggest recipes with meat</li><li>After responding, include a Spanish translation</li><li>When trip planning, include the cost per day</li><li>I can only write code in JavaScript</li><li>I prefer short, concise responses</li></ul>
<p>The above examples show that saved information in Gemini doesn't have to be very personal to be helpful. However, something like "I'm vegetarian" could be useful while Gemini compiles responses or suggestions to your queries, especially those involving food. Gemini will remember these facts until you delete them, and there is an option to disable saved information altogether.</p><p>Google makes Gemini Advanced-exclusive features available to free accounts on a fairly regular basis. Recently, it added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">document upload and analysis for free Gemini users</a>. If you aren't seeing saved information in Gemini yet, it should appear in the app and web client over the next few days.</p>

With this deal, the Oura Ring Gen 3 is just $250, while the Gen 4 retails at $500, so it's definitely worth thinking about whether you need the newest model or not.</p>

From its long battery life to the ring's two different styles, the Gen 3 Oura Ring is almost as good as its successor, especially for those who are new to the smart ring world. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Heritage-Tracking/dp/B0CSRC9JP5" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ed9f8598-9660-4cd7-ab0a-72268c564437" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Oura Ring Gen 3:" data-dimension48="Oura Ring Gen 3:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a smart ring with up to a weeks' worth of battery life; you want the basic features that come with most smart rings, such as heart rate monitoring and variability, SpO2, and temperature tracking.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you'd prefer to go with the latest generation, the Oura Ring 4; you want something that pairs reliable automatic activity detection (AAD) with heart rate data; you need something with Find My Ring for Android.</p><p>The Oura Ring Gen 3 is a great last-generation smart ring, offering a range of health features from temperature monitoring, heart rate tracking and activity detection, SpO2, and more. It also boasts about a weeks' worth of battery, and easy app compatibility that actually makes it pretty fun to use.</p><p>It is also worth considering that the Oura Ring 4 is our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart ring</a> overall, though the Gen 3 is not far behind. Both include great app support, though some of the main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">differences between the Oura Ring 3 and 4</a> primarily include the next-gen ring's updated sensors for even better health monitoring, and the addition of automatic activity detection (AAD) for heart rate data.</p><p>If those aren't dealbreakers, however, it's worth considering the extra $50 off to go last-gen—especially if you're a casual smart ring user.</p>

<p>Ground-breaking battery life on a Wear OS watch is reason enough to buy the stunning new OnePlus wearable. The magnificent screen is mighty large, but the right band offsets the size and compliments it just nicely. Invest in two to three of the best OnePlus Watch 3 bands to have a versatile set of straps at your disposal.</p><p>For OnePlus loyalists who own the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> in Ocean Blue, the first-party OnePlus Watch Strap in Nordic Blue is a must-have. This fluororubber band is made of a similar material as the Pixel Watch Active Band, which is also hypoallergenic, waterproof, and velvety soft to the touch. It's my absolute favorite band in the world so I can't recommend the similar OnePlus Watch Strap enough, despite the considerable asking price.</p><p>A classic stainless steel band is another necessary piece. You have plenty of such options to wear with your OnePlus Watch 3, thanks to its compatibility with universal quick release connectors. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-modern-fit-band-samsung-galaxy-watch-review">Spigen Modern Fit Watch Band received a glowing review</a> from Android Central's Derrek Lee so that's the one we recommend wholeheartedly. Available in black and silver, it's wallet-friendly, looks brilliant, feels durable, and works just right. You even get extra links in the box in case you need to extend the strap some more.</p><p>After you've snagged a band or two, be sure to purchase a scratch-proof <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-watch-3-screen-protectors">OnePlus Watch 3 screen protector</a> as well. It's not a must, but tiny nicks and scrapes are impossible to avoid on a watch used regularly, so you might want to err on the side of caution.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is taking an extra step to communicate its Watch 3 error with early buyers.</li><li>The company is including a physical, printed letter with Watch 3 pre-order shipments explaining the situation and customer options.</li><li>Buyers can either keep the watch, or return it.

<hr>
<p>OnePlus made a mistake so small on its latest smartwatch, the OnePlus Watch 3, that the average person might not even catch it. The device is made in China, so it's inscribed with that fact — except an unfortunate typo reads "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China." It's on the back of the smartwatch, the part that touches your wrist, meaning it isn't noticeable while you wear it. To its credit, OnePlus is making sure everyone who pre-ordered a OnePlus Watch 3 is aware of the misstep and has the chance to get a replacement.</p><p>After becoming aware of the mistake, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">responded to the issue on social media</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">delayed new sales of the Watch 3</a> to make corrected models. Like many companies do, it owned the mistake on X (formerly Twitter), but that isn't always enough. Not everyone is on social media, so OnePlus is taking an extra step to communicate the situation to Watch 3 early adopters.</p><p>The company is including a physical, printed apology letter in the box with Watch 3 pre-order shipments, as shared by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1izjtob/oneplus_watch_3_arrives_with_a_apology_letter/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo-letter-3530576/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). The letter says that OnePlus "takes great pride in our brand and our strong reputation for product craftsmanship and design." It goes on to explain the typo and offer a few options for affected customers.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS/comments/1izjtob/oneplus_watch_3_arrives_with_a_apology_letter">OnePlus watch 3 arrives with a apology letter</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WearOS">r/WearOS</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The letter largely echoes the earlier statement OnePlus made on social media, but ensures all customers who pre-ordered the Watch 3 are aware of their options. Buyers can either keep the Watch 3 with the misspelled inscription, or return it — no questions asked. OnePlus jokes that the typo makes the early Watch 3 models "one-of-a-kind."</p><p>Despite delaying the sale of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> until it can manufacture new watches, OnePlus is sending out pre-orders to buyers. Shipments include the Watch 3 and the accompanying letter, putting the onus on the customer to either keep or return it. A few OnePlus Watch 3 buyers in the above Reddit thread say they plan to keep it, as u/Marks12520 describes the gaffe as "not even noticeable."</p><p>The letter concludes with instructions for affected customers to contact OnePlus support if they need more help.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an Android 16 Beta 2.1 patch to enrolled Pixel devices with a few bug fixes.</li><li>The short list of patches includes a fix for a problem that caused Pixel phones to reboot unexpectedly.</li><li>It's available as an over-the-air update for Pixel phones enrolled in the Android Beta Program.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the second <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> beta to testers in the Android Beta Program two weeks ago, and is following that update up with a minor patch that fixes a few of the most annoying bugs. Android 16 Beta 2.1 is beginning to roll out now to enrolled Android 16 Beta 2 devices — which is supported by the Google Pixel 6 series and newer — and is described as a "minor update," per the update's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta2.1" target="_blank">release notes</a>.</p><p>Every pre-release software build is likely to have a few bugs or unexpected behaviors within, but the bugs squashed in Android 16 Beta 2.1 had the potential to be particularly frustrating. One issue caused Pixel devices on Android 16 Beta 2 to reboot unexpectedly, and another wouldn't let Pixel devices enter Doze mode. There are also fixes for choppy animations and "various other issues," according to Google.</p><p>Here's what Google's official Android 16 Beta 2.1 release notes say about the changes:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes prevented devices from entering Doze mode. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/396603519">Issue #396603519</a>)</li><li>Fixed issues that caused some animations to appear choppy while configuring live wallpapers. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/397659072">Issue #397659072</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused devices to reboot unexpectedly. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/396541565">Issue #396541565</a>)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, connectivity, and performance.</li></ul>
<p>Google's quick work of fixing bugs in Android 16 is a good sign that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">the update is progressing as expected</a>. The company appears to be on track to reach platform stability for Android 16 beginning next month, with a final release coming sometime in the second quarter of this year. It released the second Android 16 beta on Feb. 13 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">with media, camera, and graphics updates</a>, as well as a few behavior changes.</p>

<p>Now that Android 16 is in the public beta phase, it's easy to get updates like Android 16 Beta 2.1. Pixel phones that are already enrolled in the Android Beta Program — with either an Android 16 developer preview or beta build — will automatically get Android 16 Beta 2.1 over-the-air (OTA) when it is available.</p><p>There's no official word on when the OTA for Android 16 Beta 2.1 will hit eligible devices, but it should be rolling out soon, if it hasn't already. To check for the update, open the Settings app and find the <strong>System updates</strong> tab. To <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">try out Android 16 Beta 2</a>, you can enroll a supported Google Pixel phone — Pixel 6 series and newer — in the Android Beta Program <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Now Playing has been broken for many Pixel owners dating as far back as November 2024.</li><li>The feature is a way of automatically identifying the names of songs playing around you from the lock screen.</li><li>Google finally identified the problem and has a fix coming with a future Android update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-now-playing-feature-google-pixel">Now Playing</a> is a handy Pixel feature that can identify songs playing around you automatically using an on-device library. When a song is playing, it'll appear on the Pixel lock screen, and you can go back and see the full list of songs you've heard throughout the day later. Unfortunately, the feature hasn't been working for many since Android 15 QPR2 rolled out, according to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/379008495?pli=1" target="_blank">Google Issue Tracker thread</a>. Luckily, a fix is now incoming, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-now-playing-fix-coming-3530449/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>The bug saw Pixel phones unable to recognize songs with Now Playing that it would have identified in the past. It's a tricky bug to discover, because Now Playing works in the background — unlike manual alternatives, like Shazam. Now Playing is a neat party trick for Pixel owners, though, and many users noticed it not working as expected in recent months.</p><p>On the Issue Tracker thread, a Google employee now confirms that a bug did indeed break Now Playing and that a patch is on the way. "Thank you for reporting this issue," the Google employee wrote. "We have a fix rolling out in an upcoming release."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD" name="google-pixel-8-now-playing-lock-screen-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Now playing on the Pixel lock screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuFvM9PmU6gVVVTVSdNKLD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While that statement doesn't include specifics about what went wrong or when an update will roll out, it stands to reason that a patch could be included in the upcoming March Feature Drop for Pixels. As Android Authority notes, that update is already slated to include fixes for other annoying Pixel bugs, like the back gesture that doesn't always work.</p><p>The update represents a resolution for a problem that has plagued Pixel users for months, dating back to at least November 2024, according to the Issue Tracker thread. Per the thread, Google tried to fix the issue in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-3-gets-its-hands-dirty-fixing-a-slew-of-performance-issues">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 3</a>, but was only partially successful. Users reported that it still wasn't working as of the January 2025 stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> update or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1 version</a>.</p><p>Now, Pixel owners should only have to wait a bit longer to get Now Playing working on their devices again.</p>

<ul><li>Google Voice users can now transfer their calls to another person on their team with the new feature "call delegation."</li><li>It's also easier to transfer a Google Voice number from a personal Voice account to an enterprise Voice account.</li><li>In the future, Google plans to expand the features and items call delegates can access, including inbox management and call/voicemail history.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-voice-gets-a-handy-improvement-in-the-latest-update">Google Voice</a> is gaining two key features that will make using the virtual voice calling services easier for both personal and enterprise uses: call delegation and phone number transfers. The two updates are beginning to roll out now for all Google Workspace customers with a Google Voice Standard or Premier subscription, as separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/transferring-personal-google-voice-number-to-workspace-business-account.html" target="_blank">blog posts</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-voice-now-supports-call-delegation.html" target="_blank">announced</a> this week.</p><p>The first new feature, call delegation, is aimed at making it easier to collaborate in workspaces where everyone uses a Google Voice phone number. Essentially, Google Workspace admins can now "delegate" calls to other people — kind of like how call and extensions would work on a typical corporate phone line. When a Google Voice call is delegated to another person, Google writes that delegates will be able to:</p>
<ul><li>Answer calls on the delegator’s behalf</li><li>Place calls on the delegator’s behalf, including transferring the call to the delegator once connected</li><li>Transfer calls selectively to the delegator</li><li>Listen to voicemail messages and view voicemail transcripts</li></ul>
<p>Previously, there was no similar mechanism for transferring Google Voice calls from one person to another in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:297px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:215.49%;"><img id="HGZMub4AryQZf7L8Re4gCN" name="Google Voice now supports call delegation" alt="Call delegation in Google Voice." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGZMub4AryQZf7L8Re4gCN.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="297" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company explains that this is a highly-requested feature from Google Workspace customers who use Google Voice. It adds that in the future, call delegation will expand to make it possible for selected delegates to view call and voicemail history, as well as inbox management for chosen people.</p><p>The other update to Google Voice makes it possible to transfer a phone number from a personal Voice account to a paid enterprise Voice account. This is a big deal for Google Voice customers, as it establishes continuity — users may not have to switch phone numbers when moving from their own Voice account to their new company's Voice account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.06%;"><img id="mVX2fnEPoqruA7cqVboAyR" name="Consumer to Enterprise Number transfer" alt="Requesting a number transfer for Google Voice." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mVX2fnEPoqruA7cqVboAyR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="961" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google calls the process "a significantly improved experience," and it can be done without contacting the company. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/legacy-google-voice-february-shutdown">Google Voice web client</a>, users can now navigate to <strong>Account Settings</strong> and find the <strong>Transfer your number to another Voice account</strong> area. Then, you can request the transfer by choosing a Voice number and entering your Workspace email for your business. After that, an administrator at your company can approve the switch.</p><p>Google Voice is a useful virtual voice calling service, and these updates make using it more akin to a traditional phone line than ever before.</p>

If you aren't the type to need the latest release, this might be a good time to pick up some new wireless buds.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07R5QD598" target="_blank">Amazon - $149.99</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Powerbeats-Pro-Black/587866546" target="_blank">Walmart - $189.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/beats-powerbeats-pro-totally-wireless-earbuds-black/6341988.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="0abc01e7-b0b2-4c6b-bb55-447adfc57b60" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Beats Powerbeats Pro:" data-dimension48="Beats Powerbeats Pro:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that include the sporty over-ear clips; you want true wireless earbuds that include a charging case; you want earbuds with around nine hours of battery life, or up to a full day with the intermittent use of a charging case.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you don't like earbuds with over-ear clips or you wear glasses and worry they won't be a good fit together;  you need earbuds that have an IPXX rating for water and dust protection, rather than general water resistance; you need earbuds with a physical headphone jack.</p><p>Although it's been a while since the Beats Powerbeats Pros were released, they've remained the best-sellers for the brand up through the recent release of a next-gen version boasting added fitness features. But if you don't need all the bells and whistles of a new product, the original Powerbeats Pro earbuds are solid, especially when you can grab them at such a competitive price.</p><p>The charging case includes a Lightning to USB-A charging cable with super quick charging. Per charge, the earbuds themselves get around nine hours of playback time, though Beats says you can get as much as a full days' worth when using the case. In addition to their over-ear clips, which make them a good option for runners or other fitness enthusiasts, they also come with four different-sized ear tips for optimal fit.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung hasn't announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> beta programs for devices other than the three main <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 models</a>; however, there are signs that point to an expansion.</p><p>A minor hint that Samsung could add beta programs for other devices soon is the appearance of One UI 7 beta pages on the company's official community forums for phones like the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and Galaxy S23. The real indicator that a phone is about to get a One UI 7 beta is when beta builds appear on test servers — and that just happened for the Samsung Galaxy S23.</p><p>The first One UI 7 beta build for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> appeared on test servers today, Feb. 27, according to Android tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1895139350037287348?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895139350037287348%7Ctwgr%5E3aeeb8ff406d8ae10924ec80a3f87c7b42e3a148%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidpolice.com%2Fsamsung-spotted-working-on-a-one-ui-7-beta-build-for-the-galaxy-s23%2F" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter)</a>. The post identifies the build version of S918NKSU6ZYBG, with a CSC number of S918NOKR6ZYBG and a baseband version of S918NKSU6DYBG. While this doesn't amount to an official announcement, it's a good sign that a One UI 7 beta is coming for the Galaxy S23 soon.</p><p>That might not be great news for Samsung Galaxy S23 owners. If a One UI 7 beta program launches now for a phone, it'll likely be weeks or months before a stable version is ready. That means Galaxy S23 owners could be waiting until April or longer for a public release of One UI 7. For reference, the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy S24 started in December and has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">gone through five releases so far</a>.</p>

First One UI 7 beta build spotted on test server for the Galaxy S23.

Build Version: S918NKSU6ZYBG/S918NOKR6ZYBG/S918NKSU6DYBG

Is Samsung gearing up for a One UI 7 beta program for the Galaxy S23 series?

Repost pic.twitter.com/7UIIqgPcWk<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1895139350037287348">February 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The apparent move comes shortly after One UI 7 beta builds appeared on test servers for Samsung's 2024 foldables. Both the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-z-flip-6-could-get-a-one-ui-7-beta-soon">appear to have beta builds in the pipeline</a>. This would suggest Samsung plans to run beta programs for some, if not all, of the phones set to get One UI 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Gboard typically slips under the radar; however, it can no longer do so following a momentous achievement.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/26/gboard-10-billion-downloads/">9to5Google</a>, Google's Gboard app has recently crossed 10 billion downloads on the Play Store. This is a staggering number, considering it's 2x the number of active smartphones globally. The app's details on the store say it launched in June 2013, but the publication resurfaces its rebrand. Officially, the app was known as the "Google Keyboard." The company soon renamed it "Gboard" a few years later in 2016, having undergone several minor tweaks and updates over the past nine years.</p><p>The post also highlights Gboard's accomplishment alongside other Google apps to reach 10 billion downloads like YouTube, Photos, Gmail, and Maps.</p><p>Meanwhile, the publication spotted Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/27/gboard-shortcuts-button/#more-663358">rolling out a small UI change</a> for Gboard that mixes up its previous design language. Discovered in version 14.9, Gboard's shortcut button, which opens up its full shortcut menu, falls in line with the options users feature in the row above the keyboard.</p><p>It was noted that currently (if the update hasn't arrived), the shortcut button offers a colored background that adheres to your Android device's color scheme. With v14.9, that color disappears, leaving the filled in boxes to fall into a black or white color. The latter's color shift will depend on whether you're in light or dark mode.</p><p>While the shortcut is no longer contained within a circular housing like the mic icon, the button does blend in with the rest of your "favorited" shortcuts above the keyboard.</p><p>The post states this is a server-side update, meaning it could take time before everyone sees it. Android Central has spotted this update today, so it shouldn't take long before it's widespread.</p>

<p>One of the standout updates for Gboard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/june-2024-android-feature-drop">arrived last summer</a> when Google dropped its June feature drop. Specifically, the update hit the Emoji Kitchen, letting users combine emojis into an all new creation. These aren't to be used as typical emojis in texts, but rather as large stickers. The "Emoji Sticker Combinations" will fuse two selected emojis, displayed in the recommended field when selecting.</p><p>The company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gboard-split-keyboard-layout-for-foldable-phones-and-tablets">solved a typing issue</a> on larger screen devices like foldables with Gboard. The app's update lets users split it into two halves, making it easier for your thumbs to reach the keys you need to without discomfort.</p><p>There are usually subtle updates to apps such as Gboard throughout an OS' lifespan and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">is already pushing</a> for Android 16. The next major OS entered Beta 2 recently, keeping it on schedule for its intended Q2 2025 release. Perhaps there will be more for Gboard down the road with Google.</p>

<hr>
<p>As we wait impatiently for Meta to release its next generation of AR and smart glasses, Meta is tantalizing us with its new Aria Gen 2 glasses that very few people will ever get to try — but sound technically impressive and make us excited for the inevitable consumer version.</p><p>A follow-up to Meta's original Aria glasses released in 2020, the Aria Gen 2 glasses have no AR holographic capabilities but are crammed full of RGB, 6DOF SLAM, eye-tracking cameras, and even GPS tracking to interpret the world and your body's gaze and actions.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/project-aria-gen-2-next-generation-egocentric-research-glasses-reality-labs-ai-robotics/">Meta blog</a>, you can see a pair of videos of the Aria Gen 2 in action, including an impressive demo of a visually impaired woman using the familiar "Hey Meta" command to have Aria Gen 2 guide her with audio cues to the produce section of a grocery store to find apples. It looks like a next-gen version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/ray-ban-meta">Be My Eyes accessibility tool</a> for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>.</p>

<p>"Project Aria from the outset was designed to begin a revolution around always-on, human-centric computing," says Richard Newcombe, VP of Meta Reality Labs Research. The first-gen version was recently used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/blog/egomimic-project-aria-georgia-tech-ego4d-robotics-embodied-ai/">provide visual data for a robot</a> in order to help it learn to perform human tasks, translating what we normally see and hear into data a robotic AI can use.</p><p>These smart glasses use custom Meta silicon to process SLAM, eye tracking, hand tracking, and speech recognition on-device. And they last 6–8 hours — a 40% boost over the last gen — with no weight increase and looking significantly skinnier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion AR glasses</a>.</p><p>They're still heavier than Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, with noticeably thick arms, but might blend in as somewhat "normal" glasses when the camera light isn't on, and seemingly doesn't need any kind of wireless puck like Project Orion.</p>

<p>"With Gen 2 glasses, we are building AI capabilities with a deeper understanding of the wearer's context and environment," says Mingfei Yan, Director of Project Management for AR research.</p><p>The Gen 2 version adds a PPG in the nosepad for continuous heart rate data, as well as a contact microphone "to distinguish the wearer’s voice from that of bystanders."</p><p>Meta is largely offering Aria Gen 2 glasses to researchers and students, allowing them to take this raw stream of multisensor data and do whatever they might think of. You can sign up to try out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfukXP5q6dclAAA3php-OCO1TcwFc5Opegrvw23wHwEbOFJbA/viewform">Aria Gen 2</a> at that link.</p><p>Recent leaks suggest that Meta is working on new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley smart glasses</a>, a $1,000 Hypernova prototype with AR capabilities, and a follow-up to Orion codenamed Artemis. Meta won't sell the Aria Gen 2, but some of its capabilities, sensors, and Meta AI upgrades could easily end up in new Meta consumer devices in the next year or two.</p><p>For now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> like Ray-Ban Meta and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> are helping us cope with the wait, and we'll have to see how much Aria Gen 2 DNA ends up on display at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-announces-connect-2025-and-first-llamacon">Meta Connect 2025</a>.</p>

<ul><li>A leak claims Nothing's new Phone 3a button will be called the Essential Key, which activates its new AI suite of Essential Space features.</li><li>Users can snap photos, capture voice notes, and more through various key pressing functions and the AI will "sort" and "categorize" them for you.</li><li>Nothing previously teased a new button, which was previously thought to be a dedicated physical camera button for the 3a Series.</li><li>The Nothing Phone 3a Series launches on March 4.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>An alleged discovery suggests the new Nothing Phone 3a Series button is more than we previously thought.</p><p>The leaks stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/first-look-at-nothing-phone-3a-pros-essential-key-and-its-features">SmartPrix</a> in conjunction with tipster Shivam Kumar, claiming the new button will be a part of an AI suite called "Essential Spaces." One of the suite's highlights is "Smart Collection," which seems to involve "sorting" and "categorizing" your digital data. Specifically, the post states the AI will sort images, audio, and text files you've amassed throughout your daily life.</p><p>The other side of this is Smart Collection's recognition, which lets it place your captured images, audio, and text files in the appropriate "Spaces."</p><p>The tipster's discovery adds that the AI suite will deliver "Focused Search" and "Flip to Record," a feature that will likely let users record voice notes. Then, there's "Camera Capture." Rumors claim this is only usable within the camera app as users can press this physical button or "Essential Key" to snap a picture. The result is said to be stored within Essential Space for easy rediscovery.</p><p>The Essential Key holds power over all of the AI suite's functions. A leaked splash screen states the Essential Key, located on the right side of the device, will "capture your thoughts on the go with the power of AI."</p><p>The publication claims users can press, long-press, or double press it for different functions. Pressing it once is used for capturing, similar to what was rumored for Camera Capture. Long-pressing is supposedly used for voice notes while double-pressing opens up Essential Space to see what the AI has stored for you.</p>

<p>Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">teased a new physical button</a> for its upcoming Phone 3a Series early in February, which led us to believe it was a dedicated camera button. Now, it seems the camera is only a piece of the pie. The company's tagline read, "Your second memory, one click away." That sentiment is echoed in the recent leaks about the button, allegedly the Essential Key.</p><p>The post by SmartPrix claims Nothing is still fleshing out the AI suite and Essential Key functions. Rumors add a "full-fledged" version could arrive on the flagship Phone 3.</p><p>While all eyes are on the Phone 3a Series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">a quarterly report</a> video confirmed the Phone 3 is coming and will be a "milestone" for Nothing.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">leaked email</a> from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei shed light on the company's newfound ambitions with AI moving into 2025. Pei stated the upcoming devices will offer “breakthrough innovations in user interface” alongside AI. The UI redesign is also designed to make the user's life "easier."</p><p>We don't have much longer to wait for the Nothing Phone 3a Series. The company has confirmed the phones will launch on March 4.</p>

<ul><li>Amazon announced its new AI assistant — Alexa Plus, which is said to be more conversational and intuitively understands the user's needs.</li><li>Alexa Plus can interact across different streaming, home devices, and shopping apps.

<hr>
<p>Amazon seems to finally be getting on the AI train, so to speak, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/new-alexa-generative-artificial-intelligence">launched </a>the new Alexa Plus this week. According to the company, this newly supercharged AI powered assistant is more intuitive, understanding the user's needs more effortlessly than the previous model.</p><p>The company claims that Alexa Plus is trained to not only summarize complex topics but also manage and "protect your home, make reservations, and help you track, discover, and enjoy new artists." Amazon seems to be bringing a multi-faceted approach to all of its products by integrating Alexa Plus within them. Users will be able to find or buy anything online with just a quick voice command to this AI-powered assistant.</p><p>Amazon further stated that it had to practically rebuild the new assistant using tech that connects a variety of large language models (LLMs), which will help it interact with other services across the globe. "To achieve this, we created a concept called 'experts' — groups of systems, capabilities, APIs, and instructions that accomplish specific types of tasks for customers," the release added.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pVh5D8oGiZ2Hn8wkiMVQAH" name="Amazon-Alexa-Plus-navigation" alt="Amazon Alexa Plus is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pVh5D8oGiZ2Hn8wkiMVQAH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This means that Alexa Plus can seamlessly connect to varied applications and services that are outside the Amazon universe as well. As a result, the company's assistant can cross-communicate with a wide range of apps, including streaming services like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Hulu, and also home devices from companies like Philips Hue and Roborock.</p><p>Additionally, Alexa Plus can also be directed to complete tasks on the user's behalf behind the scenes. For instance, if your oven needs fixing, Alexa Plus will be able to look for the service provider online and arrange the repair based on your schedule — all without the user's intervention.</p><p>Like any other AI assistant on the market, Alexa Plus can answer questions like "What is the lowest point in any ocean on earth?” or just something vague like “What’s the song that Bradley Cooper sings at the start of that country music movie?" However, users can go a step further and upload documents, emails, or photos — via a desktop browser or the mobile app — for the assistant to analyze and summarize for them if needed, a feature <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">opened up to free users</a>.</p><p>Lastly, Amazon says that the user gets to control information that is shared with the AI assistant via a built-in Privacy dashboard on the app.</p><p>This new and improved Alexa Plus comes for $19.99 per month for those not subscribed to Amazon Prime. However, if you're an Amazon Prime subscriber, access to Alexa Plus is free, adding even more value to the subscription. It will roll out in the U.S. in the coming weeks for Echo Show owners, although you'll need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DCCNHWV5?ref=ods_surl_xaa_us">sign up for early access</a> to get it. Everyone else will receive Alexa Plus over the coming months.</p>

From Viture to Xreal, TCL Ray-Neo and a random assortment of other companies that didn't quite last, smart display glasses have been on a path to greatness for sometime but never quite achieved it. That is, until Xreal One came along.</p>

<p>Xreal has always made good, competitive products in the smart display glasses category, but Xreal One presses the reset button on what I thought smart display glasses could do.</p><p>That all starts from the moment you plug them in. A Quick flash of the Xreal logo appears, and just a second or two later, you're greeted with a giant floating virtual monitor in front of your face. You've likely heard this pitch before when reading about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a>, but all of those glasses only offer a slice of Xreal One's functionality, not the whole pie.</p><p>The real joy with Xreal One is the simplicity of the product. Three degrees of freedom (3DoF) is enabled by default, so the virtual monitor floats in real space from the moment you turn it on. There's no room for scanning to do or some special mode to enable. It just works, and it's the shot in the arm the product category has seriously needed.</p>

<p>Xreal One is the best pair of smart display glasses I've ever used, full stop. I've used my fair share of them over the years, from TCL Ray Neo to Viture and several other brands you might not recognize, but none have done the job as well as Xreal has here. Aside from excellent design and technical specs, Xreal One nails the implementation and concept of smart display glasses in a way none of these brands yet have, and it makes all the difference.</p><p>When I first got my pair, I wasn't sure what to expect. Most smart display glasses feel like carbon copies of one another, and few of them work very well. Xreal One not only fixes some of the most major pain points — brightness levels, display edge fringing, weight, comfort, and display clarity — but it also adds near-perfect 3DoF tracking that's enabled by default.</p><p>Unlike some other smart display glasses that support the feature, Xreal One's 3DoF tracking doesn't constantly shift or slide over time. When I put on a pair of Xreal One glasses, the giant virtual screen appears in front of me and stays there no matter how much I move. Even if I get up and put the glasses down, the screen is where I left it before I got up. That's a win in and of itself, and it makes these finally <em>fun</em> to use instead of an annoying chore.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Xreal One not only fixes some of the most major pain points of smart display glasses — brightness levels, display edge fringing, weight, comfort, and display clarity — but it also adds near-perfect 3DoF tracking that's enabled by default.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's impossible to understate how important this is to this category of product. Most smart display glasses requrie some sort of external peripheral to provide proper 3DoF tracking. Even the ones that have 3DoF built-in — like TCL Ray-Neo glasses — often suffer from drift, meaning the virtual monitor will slowly move over time.</p><p>This makes 3DoF an <em>essential</em> part of the Xreal One experience, and it's something that just works out of the box without needing to switch modes or toggle something special. In addition to that, the X1 chip allows Xreal One glasses to deliver an industry-leading motion to photon latency of 3ms, meaning that any head movements made are completely lag-free.</p><p>While the default settings are wonderful, additional settings are a quick double-press of the power button away. This brings up a menu that looks and feels identical to a proper monitor. It's got all the toggles and options you would expect of a proper monitor, too, including special options that are only necessary on a pair of AR glasses including IPD adjustment — a first for smart display glasses.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The X1 chip allows Xreal One glasses to deliver an industry-leading motion to photon latency of 3ms, meaning that any head movements made are completely lag-free.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Xreal One is also the only pair of smart display glasses I've ever used that don't give me a headache when using 3DoF tracking. They employ a form of black frame insertion to keep motion resolution crisp. Previous pairs of Xreal glasses used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> all the time, which gave me a headache in a matter of seconds, but this pair offers a mode that employs DC dimming for folks who are sensitive to flicker.</p><p>With that said, Xreal One does use 240Hz PWM dimming when the default anchored mode is used. I haven't been able to use glasses like this in the past because of the low-Hz PWM rate, but I think the glasses' 3ms motion-to-photon latency helps make them usable. They're also <em>only</em> 500 nits of perceived brightness, and I've found that low-Hz PWM affects me most when brightness is greater than 1200 nits.</p><p>I've stuck with Viture One for years now as they were the only other pair of smart display glasses that used DC dimming and, even then, only at 100% brightness and with no positional tracking enabled. Xreal Air ticks all the comfort boxes for me and includes plenty of other calibration options to help make the picture look as good as possible.</p>

<p>The viewable area is substantially increased over previous generations, with a 20% larger FoV at 50 degrees. In plain English, that means you can see the entire virtual monitor without having to move your head a bit to see the edges — a common problem among most smart display glasses. Edge fringing is completely gone, too, eliminating another common pain point.</p><p>Xreal One supports 3D video and an incredible ultrawide mode that has to be seen to be believed. The ultrawide mode makes the monitor 3-4 times wider than a traditional monitor, making multitasking a joy on a laptop.</p><p>You can customize the top button to perform one of several functions, including different ones for short-press, long-press, and double-press. I found that toggling between electrochromic tint levels was my favorite use of the double-press while single-pressing the button completely turned the display on or off so I could quickly see what was around me.</p>

<p>Electrochromic dimming isn't new to smart display glasses but there aren't too many pairs that employ the feature this well. The darkest tint level completely blacked out what was in front of me, making it super easy to see the display even in a sunlit area.</p><p>The frames are by far the most comfortable smart display glasses design I've ever worn, too. They use the same temple adjustment mechanism as some previous pairs of Xreal glasses — meaning they adjust to three different angles to fit different face shapes — and have a new nost pad design that's more comfortable than ever.</p><p>The weight is comparable with other smart display glasses like Viture One, but the design of the lenses — that trademark Xreal larger frame design — looks superb along with the new thinner optics. Xreal even curved the ends of the temples to keep them from sliding down your nose, a problem that occurs on some other brands' designs.</p>

<p>The biggest downside to Xreal One is the price. At $499, they're the most expensive pair of smart display glasses as of this writing. Tack on another $50 or so to that price if you need prescription inserts, and all of a sudden, you're spending more than what a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review" target="_blank">Meta Quest 3</a> costs. Considering these are just a wearable monitor, $500 can be a hard ask.</p><p>Of course, using a pair of glasses like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-really-saved-my-neck">will literally save your neck</a> if you find yourself traveling a lot or working from a coffee shop regularly. Looking down at a laptop is horrible for you and will cause problems over time. Wearing a pair of Xreal Ones will save you from neck pain since you can look straight at a big virtual monitor instead of down at a screen.</p><p>Furthermore, Nintendo Switch players will need to pick up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XREAL-Adapter-Glasses-Charging-Android/dp/B0CZ6PX17L/">$40 Xreal Hub</a> to make it work with the glasses, and you'll also need an external power bank capable of 45-60W output. Any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best power banks</a> will do. All this nonsense is the Switch's fault — not Xreal's — since the Switch has to be docked to output video. Still, be aware that you'll need some extra hardware if you want to use this with a Switch. Other devices like the Steam Deck and simply plug-and-play.</p>

<p>If $500 is too rich for your blood, Viture One is the best budget alternative. These glasses regularly go on sale for under $300 and have similar plug-and-play capability with laptops and the Steam Deck but don't offer 3DoF functionality out of the box. They also don't get as bright and have distortion on the edges of the displays, but they do offer DC dimming at high brightness, so they're great for anyone with PWM sensitivity.</p><p>Viture Pro is the closest competition based on display quality, offering a similar edge-distortion-free experience and a super bright OLED panel. They're regularly $100 less than Xreal One but don't offer native 3DoF support, just smooth follow. Viture offers a lot of fantastic accessories, though — like the Switch dock, which doubles as a power bank — plus the excellent new Viture Neckband that turns it into a full spatial computer. Xreal's best competition is the Xreal Beam Pro which is essentially an Android phone without a cell modem inside.</p><p>Xreal's upcoming Xreal One Pro glasses appear to offer an even better experience based on specs, including an even wider FoV, an optional camera module, and more. If you want to wait for the best of the best, they're expected to launch sometime in spring 2025.</p>

<p>I've been a firm believer in using smart display glasses instead of my laptop's monitor when I travel. I've tried bringing a more full-featured VR headset on trips, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-airplane-mode-size-complaint">they're just too big</a>. Xreal One is two <em>very</em> important steps closer to being a full-fledged spatial computer — native 3DoF and an industry-leading motion to photon latency, and that makes them more attractive than any other smart display glasses option available today.</p><p>Since I received the pair back in December, I haven't needed (or wanted) to use any other smart glasses. Throughout 2024, I used my Quest 3 as my main virtual monitor machine when not working at my desk, but Xreal One has all but completely replaced that headset as a daily work device for me.</p><p>These glasses have been a huge game changer for me in finding places to work in my house when my basement office isn't usable — either because it's too cold or the Radon levels are too high — and that's been reason alone for me to justify a purchase. If you're looking for the best pair of smart display glasses available, these are <em>the ones</em>.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered Google's redesign for the old text "details" pop-up in the Messages app.</li><li>The redesign lets users see who the text was delivered to and when they read it as timestamps are featured in each category.</li><li>Google is also working on bringing 911 RCS support to Messages, as well as scam detection features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Messages app is reportedly working on expanding text information detailing everything that happened to it.</p><p>The supposed update was spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-view-details-apk-teardown-3529412/">Android Authority</a>), who claims a text's "details" page may get an overhaul. In a recent Messages beta version, the tipster states they were able to leverage a new details page, instead of the old (current) pop-up window. This new page gives insight into the text message you've "long-pressed" at the top.</p><p>The core of this redesign under development is the ability for users to see what happened to the text; i.e., its delivery and read status <em>per person</em>. In group chats, viewing a text's details will show who the text was delivered to and who read it. The tipster found evidence showing the revamped page will organize things via "Read by" and "Delivered to" titles.</p><p>Each section features timestamps beside the person the message was sent to in the chat.</p><p>Beneath these sections, it seems Google will display its technical bits of information like the "type" of message, which should be E2EE (end-to-end encryption), priority, and more.</p><p>Interestingly, the tipster notes the redesign lets users tap a person's icon to access calling, one-on-one texting, and "information" options.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:267px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.72%;"><img id="CcDz3oyssJhXeaciTXEUyC" name="google-messages-text-details-redesign-spotted" alt="Google Messages could redesign its text details page, so users can see who left them on read." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CcDz3oyssJhXeaciTXEUyC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="267" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It doesn't appear that the redesign is appearing widely in the beta, meaning we'll likely have to wait a while longer before/if Google rolls it out.</p><p>In addition to knowing who left you on read, the company started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">testing improved scam detection</a> in Messages. Testing kicked off during a beta last fall as Google leveraged on-device AI to run scam detection checks for text. The AI can even catch suspicious links and other "unwanted content."</p><p>Google highlighted in a recent blog post that these scam detection measures in Messages, as well as the Phone app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-prepares-pixels-official-scam-detection-rollout">should arrive in March</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, it seems Google is inching closer to officially rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-911-rcs-support-nearly-ready-detailed">911 RCS support</a> in Messages. Several more pieces of code were added to a recent Messages app version, delivering insight into its location-sharing functions for your local authorities. Google started down this path after FCC data showed roughly 53% of the emergency centers in the U.S. support text messages as a viable form of communication.</p>

<p>After introducing the Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro phones in China last year, the company is back with its premium flagship, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra — released for the Chinese region. Meanwhile, its global launch is set for March 2 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-what-to-expect">MWC Barcelona</a>.</p><p>The predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, has been quite a successful phone from last year as it featured impressive specs and great cameras.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:965px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.18%;"><img id="6oXKRegtFShWkqtGFv4MK5" name="xiaomi-15-ultra-official-02" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6oXKRegtFShWkqtGFv4MK5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="965" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xiaomi)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the front, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra carries the same 6.73-inch LTPO screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and Xiaomi Shield glass 2 protection on the top. The phone comes with interesting colorways, along with the regular white and black, it also has dual-tone options like pine and cypress green and classic black and silver colorways. The storage options on the handset include up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of onboard (UFS 4.1) storage.</p><p>Since it is yet another camera-centric flagship, the device includes a quad-camera system coupled with Leica branding. A 50MP Sony LYT-900 acts as the primary sensor with a fixed f/1.63 aperture. Whereas the last year’s model included a variable aperture.</p><p>Another 50MP telephoto Sony IMX858 is also present next to a 50MP Samsung JN5 ultra-wide-angle lens. As mentioned, the new 200MP super-telephoto lens should be a value addition to the already proven camera system, and it is the Samsung HP9 lens. These rear cameras also support 8K video shooting at 30fps. On the front, there is a 32MP camera for selfies.</p>

<p>Keeping the lights on on the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, is a 6000mAh battery, a notable increase over the predecessor model. However, it carries the same 90W wired charging, 80W wireless charging, and 18W reverse wired charging support.</p><p>The other highlights of the Xiaomi flagship phone include support for Bluetooth 6.0, Wi-Fi 7, ultrasonic fingerprint sensors, NFC, and support for satellite communication is also present. The device ships with the Android 15-based Xiaomi HyperOS 2 operating system.</p><p>Lastly, for the pricing, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra starts at CNY 6499, roughly $893. The global launch is happening next week, where we might witness what the company wants to offer for different regions.</p>

The unlocked RedMagic 10 Pro, one of the most powerful Android gaming phones on the market, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Unlocked/dp/B0DNPXS894"><strong>just scored a 15% discount at Amazon, knocking the price down to its lowest point yet.</strong></a>  </p><p>The powerful device just hit store shelves in late 2024, but it&apos;s already impressed users with its gorgeous display, massive 7,050mAh battery, and Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (the same processor that powers the Galaxy S25 Ultra). It&apos;s possible that the price will dip a bit further when Prime Day hits in July, but if you don&apos;t want to wait, this is an incredible deal on an incredible unlocked phone. </p>

<p>The latest <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">gaming smartphone</a> from the bright minds at RedMagic, 2024's 10 Pro is a powerful device specially built to stay cool and lightning-fast during the most intense gaming sessions. </p>
<p>Buy the phone unlocked from Amazon today (in Black only) and you'll score a straight 15% discount, which is the largest price drop that the device has ever received from the retailer. If you need more storage, the 512GB version of the phone is also receiving a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Transparent/dp/B0DNPT3MN4"><strong>15% discount at Amazon.</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/REDMAGIC-Smartphone-Snapdragon-Dual-Sim-Unlocked/dp/B0DNPXS894" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="187e6579-3e3d-4dcb-b78d-6e735149b38e" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749" data-dimension48="$749">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want one of the most powerful gaming phones ever built, with a stunning 144Hz display, days of battery life, and an advanced cooling system for long play sessions. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a jack-of-all-trades smartphone; you need great cameras or long software support (the RedMagic 10 Pro is only set to receive one OS upgrade, which is a major bummer). </p><p>The first thing that you&apos;ll notice about the RedMagic 10 Pro is its display. The phone boasts a glorious 6.85-inch AMOLED display with a butter-smooth 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that you&apos;ll never have to worry about lag or stutter when you&apos;re playing graphics-intensive titles. That&apos;s around the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>&apos;s display, but the RedMagic 10 Pro also utilizes ultra-thin bezels to maximize screen space. Things are just as impressive under the hood, as the RedMagic 10 Pro is powered by Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite, a processor that&apos;s widely considered to be one of the best chipsets on the market today. The phone also features a 7,050mAh that&apos;s estimated to last up to 52 hours on a single charge, plus the device&apos;s built-in cooling system and built-in fan ensure that overheating will never be an issue. </p><p>To be clear, the RedMagic 10 Pro is a <em>gaming smartphone </em>before all else, so if you&apos;re looking for a jack of all trades, your money would be better spent on one of the other great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> that are out right now. With the 10 Pro, you&apos;re settling for average cameras and fewer OS upgrades, plus you&apos;ll want to check with your carrier to make sure that the phone can access its local 5G network. </p><p>In other words, if you&apos;re ready to use one of the best gaming phones on the market, this RedMagic deal is an outstanding opportunity. But if you just want a phone that&apos;s good at, well, being a phone, I&apos;ve got plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/deals">other deals</a> to recommend.</p>

<ul><li>The slimmest Galaxy phone is tipped to be coming on April 16, and the wider availability of the handset is expected in May.</li><li>The device should be significantly slimmer than the Galaxy S25 trio, and likely be placed in between the standard Galaxy S25 and the Ultra — in terms of pricing.</li><li>The Galaxy S25 Edge is also expected to come in three colorways: blue, black, and silver.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>This year is already turning out to be a great one for Android phones with multiple innovations coming our way— including the world's thinnest foldable from Oppo. Samsung is also leaning on a slim form factor, with its  Galaxy S25 Edge, which is now tipped to be coming sooner than expected.</p><p>Per the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2GP4TH0TVP">Sedaily Korean report</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1895026937946612045">Jukanlosreve on X</a>), Samsung is most likely to launch the device on April 16. The decision was allegedly made by the company's Mobile Experience (MX) Division. The publication also adds that the phone will reach people's palms later in May.</p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy Edge 25 could launch in three colorways, including light blue, black, and silver. Unlike just the one we saw at Samsung's Unpacked this year, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>. When Samsung showcased the device for the media at Unpacked, nobody was allowed anywhere near it, let alone get their hands on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-side-comparison-01" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, there was no word about the S25 Edge phone's pricing at the Unpacked event. However, the Korean publication indicates that the handset will be priced somewhere between the standard Galaxy S25 and the Ultra model. Additionally, Samsung might be shipping 40,000 units first — as part of an initial rollout.</p><p>As for the specifics of the handset, it is tipped to be 6.4mm — significantly slimmer than the other models in the series. The dual camera visor at the back is expected to be carrying a 200MP primary lens and a 50MP wide-angle camera. Underneath, like the flagship models, the S25 Edge will likely be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset.</p><p>Some of these specs were also witnessed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/deleted-youtube-video-shows-the-samsungs-thin-s25-edge-in-action">recent hands-on leak</a> of the Galaxy S25 Edge. In a now-deleted YouTube video, the device was showcased right next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which gave away the thinner form factor of the handset. Additonally, 128/256GB storage options alongside a 4000mAh battery capacity of the Galaxy S25 Edge were also revealed in the same leak.</p><p>It looks like Samsung's latest slimmest phone from the Galaxy S25 series will compete with the much-discussed Apple iPhone 17 Air. It is anticipated to debut with the upcoming iPhone series and be the thinnest iPhone Apple has ever produced. Samsung should likely have an advantage because it is releasing its thinnest phone sooner.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oura today introduced a new feature for its smart rings designed to pick up on the natural changes that happen throughout a woman's menstrual cycle. The goal is to give your ring a better read on your body around the clock.</p><p>Oura is making its Readiness Score even sharper by including menstrual cycle changes. With the "Readiness Score Algorithm Improvement" feature, Oura's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">fan-favorite smart rings</a> will account for things like higher heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, and lower HRV during the luteal phase.</p><p>The company notes that 35% of users with cycles won’t see their Readiness Score dip during the luteal phase anymore, representing an 81% drop in cycle-related score changes.</p><p>Oura’s new cycle-tracking feature is part of its bigger push into women’s health, adding another tool to help you understand your body better.</p><p>In late 2024, Oura expanded its women’s health tracking with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/what-is-fertile-window/" target="_blank">Fertile Window feature</a> in Cycle Insights, using your body’s data to pinpoint likely fertile days.</p><p>By blending Oura’s temperature tracking with heart rate, HRV, and breathing data, this feature zeroes in on your fertile days with more precision.</p><p>Alongside these updates, Oura is kicking off research initiatives to dig deeper into women’s health and find new ways to help users.</p><p>Oura is teaming up with Scripps Research Digital Trials Center for a new pregnancy study. The aim is to analyze biometric data from the past three years to spot early warning signs for issues like postpartum depression and miscarriage. They’re recruiting 10,000 Oura Ring users who’ve been pregnant to make it happen.</p><p>Additionally, Oura and Stanford University School of Medicine are joining forces for the STIGMA (Study on Typically Ignored Groups of Menstruating Adults) study, focusing on underrepresented menstruating groups.</p><p>With up to 10,000 participants wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Rings</a>, they’ll investigate how socioeconomic factors, reproductive disorders, and hormonal changes influence cycles.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is rumored to sport a 13.1-inch display, making it larger than the 12.4-inch S9 FE Plus.</li><li>The regular S10 FE is reportedly sticking to 10.9 inches, just like last year’s model.</li><li>Expect different RAM and storage options, with the top model featuring 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Samsung is gearing up to give the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus a bigger display, outshining its predecessor in screen size.</p><p>We’ve already heard a lot about the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and S10 FE Plus in terms of their processor, memory, and connectivity specs. But one thing was still up in the air: how the S10 FE Plus’s size stacks up against the S9 FE Plus. Thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bsky.app/profile/rquandt.bsky.social/post/3lj3ebunmy225" target="_blank">Roland Quandt</a>, we finally have the scoop on that missing piece of the puzzle (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-tab-s10-fe-larger-screen-tab-s9-fe/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>According to the tipster, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is set to feature a 13.1-inch display, while the standard S10 FE is expected to have a 10.9-inch screen, like last year's model.</p><p>For context, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe">Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus</a> has a 12.4-inch display, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">standard S9 FE</a> comes with 10.9 inches.</p><p>The previous models have proven to be solid alternatives to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung’s flagship tablets</a>, offering a balance of affordability and performance. Now, to make the Tab S10 FE Plus even more enticing, Samsung seems to be upping the ante with a noticeably bigger screen.</p><p>If these specs turn out to be true, Samsung’s budget-friendly tablet could outshine the iPad Air 13’s 12.9-inch display.</p><p>Even with its sizable 13.1-inch display, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus is still smaller than Samsung’s high-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Tab S10 Ultra</a>. But with a much lower price tag, it gives buyers a solid big-screen option without breaking the bank.</p><p>At the same time, Quandt confirmed that both tablets will come in multiple setups, with options for different memory sizes. The top-tier versions are tipped to pack 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p><p>Sticking to the budget-friendly approach of the Tab S10 FE series, it’s expected to run on the Exynos 1580 chip. While it’s not a powerhouse, this mid-range processor from Samsung should handle everyday tasks just fine.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube surpassed one billion monthly active podcast viewers, a key threshold for the platform.</li><li>Google is going all-in on YouTube and YouTube Music for podcasts after shutting down Google Podcasts last year.</li><li>According to an independent report, YouTube is also now the most frequently used podcast client in the U.S.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nearly a year after Google made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-podcasts-shuts-down">surprising decision to shutter Google Podcasts</a>, it appears that YouTube has successfully emerged as its replacement. The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-use-machine-learning-to-figure-out-whos-lying-about-their-age">shared its "big bets" for YouTube in 2025</a>, and one of them seems to be paying off early. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/1-billion-monthly-podcast-users/" target="_blank">blog post</a> today, Feb. 26, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> shared that it eclipsed one billion monthly podcast viewers — an important achievement for the platform.</p><p>"This milestone underscores how YouTube has come to play an essential role in podcasting for creators and audiences, and how our investments to improve the podcast experience on YouTube are paying off," writes Tim Katz, the VP of partnerships and podcasts at YouTube. "Podcasts with video are more than just a trend, they meet audiences where they are: on YouTube."</p><p>The monthly active viewer threshold is just part of the reason YouTube is taking a victory lap for its podcast delivery efforts. The platform claims that it is "the most frequently used service for listening to podcasts in the U.S. and often the first place people go when looking for a new podcast," citing an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/youtube-is-the-preferred-podcast-listening-service/" target="_blank">Edison Research report</a> from October 2024. The report found that YouTube is more popular among podcast listeners than both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a> and Apple Podcasts.</p><p>In terms of market share, Edison reports that YouTube Music is the most popular podcast delivery service among weekly podcast listeners ages 13 and up. It has 31% of the market, compared to 27% for Spotify and 15% for Apple Podcasts. Edison's metrics measure "listening, not downloads, across all networks, shows, and platforms," per the report.</p><p>Last year, YouTube says viewers consumed over 400 million hours of podcasts on its platforms — both audio and video podcasts. The move comes as Google embraces YouTube and YouTube Music for podcast delivery. It's continuing to grow YouTube's podcast functionality. At the end of last year, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-gains-a-crucial-feature-for-podcast-listening-and-sharing">added shareable links</a> that let listeners start shared podcasts at a specific timestamp.</p>

It's also worth noting that the Ultra and Plus share the same processor, so the Plus will get the job done for most.</p>

<hr>
<p>Just when you thought that the Android gaming scene couldn't get any better, Retroid announces the Pocket Flip 2. This is the successor to the original Pocket Flip that was released in March 2023, before it was quietly discontinued sometime between December 2023 and January 2024.</p><p>The vast majority of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a> are available in either a vertical or horizontal orientation, with only a few clamshell models being available. This is one of the reasons why the original Pocket Flip quickly became a fan favorite, as it not only was a clamshell but was also powered by Android.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEgqhkwfHQU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Unfortunately, the Achilles heel for Retroid was manufacturing a hinge that would be able to withstand regular use. Many of those who picked up the original Pocket Flip ended up with a broken hinge, which is one of the main focuses of the Pocket Flip 2.</p><p>In the latest announcement, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Retroid0fficial/status/1894719069447729606">Retroid revealed</a> all of the specs and color options that the Pocket Flip 2 will be released with. Starting off, the clamshell sports a 5.5-inch 1080p AMOLED display, capable of reaching up to 500 nits of brightness. Moving from an IPS panel to AMOLED was another massive fan request, especially after the Retroid Pocket 5 was released with one.</p><p>When it comes to powering the Pocket Flip 2, there will be two different processor options to choose from. You'll either be able to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-870-vs-snapdragon-888-vs-snapdragon-865">Snapdragon 865</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mediatek-unveils-flagship-dimensity-1100-1200-5g-processors-challenge-snapdragon-888">Dimensity 1100</a>, two chips that are very familiar within the Retroid community. These will be paired with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage to go along with a 5,000mAh battery.</p>

<p>Considering that in the smartphone world, we're always chasing the latest, greatest, and most powerful, this decision might seem odd. However, seeing as these chips are more than a few years old, that means Retroid is able to get them for much less.</p><p>As a result, Retroid is able to deliver more affordable gaming handhelds. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld">Retroid Pocket 5 retails for $219</a>, while the Pocket Mini (also using the Snapdragon 865) is $199. Although we don't yet know how much the Flip 2 will cost, it's likely safe to assume that the Dimensity 1100 model could start at $249, with a $20 or $30 increase for the SD865 variant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.02%;"><img id="mnHHR5Hms3DwmqgLnwnR3K" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-color-grid-render" alt="Color options grid for the Retroid Pocket Flip 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mnHHR5Hms3DwmqgLnwnR3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3636" height="2255" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to revealing the entire spec sheet, Retroid also provided everyone with a look at the four different color options consisting of Ice Blue, GC, 16Bit US, and Black. Both the GC and 16Bit US are carry-overs from the Retroid Pocket 5, with the exception of the buttons on the Pocket Flip 2.</p><p>However, based on reactions on social media and Discord, Ice Blue seems to be the early fan favorite. This isn't all that surprising, given that the same was true when the Retroid Pocket 4 and 4 Pro were released in the Ice Blue colorway. The only real disappointment is that the Watermelon (transparent red) doesn't appear to be in the plans.</p><p>Much like how smartphone companies operate nowadays, these retro handheld makers like to trickle out little bits of information slowly. Such is the case with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2, so we'll be keeping our eyes out for when pricing and availability information are provided.</p>

<ul><li>Google is now expecting employees from the U.S. PeopleOps team to voluntarily quit.</li><li>An email was sent by the company's CPO (Chief People Officer) announcing new roles and severance packages for these employees.</li><li>This program is the result of a merger that occurred between the organization’s OS and hardware teams.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In an email sent to employees this week, Google announced a new “voluntary exit” program for its People Operations team, which basically handles all of the company's hiring, employee perks and benefits, and more.</p><p>According to an email obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/25/google-peopleops-voluntary-exits/#more-663073">9to5Google</a>, the company’s Chief People Officer, Fiona Cicconi, announced the voluntary exit program for U.S.-based employees. This follows a similar move<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-employees-from-pixel-and-android-teams-to-voluntarily-quit"> announced</a> in January to the Platform and Devices group.</p><p>Initially, the program had only opened up for U.S. employees in teams that serve Android Auto, Android TV, Wear OS, and the recent Android XR platform alongside a wide range of Google and Chrome products. However, it looks like the company plans to expand this program to other teams as well. Considering the tech giant would like to downsize the number of employees, stating efficiency concerns.</p><p>"There’s tremendous momentum on this team and with so much important work ahead, we want everyone to be deeply committed to our mission and focused on building great products, with speed and efficiency,” said SVP Rick Osterloh when he announced this program.</p><p>According to the company, the People Ops team recently made some changes to the way it functions, mainly focusing on innovation that would drive high performance across Google.</p><p>This came after the tech giant merged its OS and hardware teams into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-hardware-team-restructuring-merge">new Platforms & Devices team</a>. The move appears to be an effort for better efficiency within the company. It is likely being offered as an alternative for employees who can choose to quit — as opposed to being laid off — if they feel they no longer align with their roles, with the option to take a severance package or apply to roles in other teams.</p><p>In an email to Android Central, Google's spokesperson said, "To support our People Operations team’s innovative work ahead, we’re opening new roles and offering a voluntary exit program with severance for their US-based employees.”</p><p>Google will also open new roles within PeopleOps to help employees make the right decisions that best suit their personal/professional interests.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Qualcomm recently announced that phones using the Snapdragon 8 and 7 series mobile platforms will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-collaborates-with-google-bringing-extended-support-to-certain-android-phones">eligible for eight years of update support</a> if they're running Android. Google is on board and will work to make this happen, too. But what exactly does that mean?</p><p>It can be confusing because the word update means a lot of different things to us. An update is simply something you install that exchanges bits of software or adds new software to what already exists.</p><p>You get updates for apps, updates for your keyboard, and every other bit of software running on your phone, including the Android operating system. That's where this comes into play.</p>
<p>Android on your phone — this also goes for tablets — gets updated three different ways. This affects at least two of the three and should also apply to the other in time.</p><p>You have platform version updates, and those are the ones everyone cares about, such as when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> comes along to replace Android 15. This commitment covers these types of updates, according to Google. So, if you buy a new phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> today that runs Android 15 and uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, you <em>could</em> get Android 23 in eight years. It will be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">watered-down version of Android 23</a>, but the platform and API version will be the same, so you can run all the same applications as phones in 2033.</p><p>Of course, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-tell-when-phones-battery-has-gone-bad">phone's battery will have bit the dust</a> long before then so it's a bit of a hollow promise.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CmAKQskKRatMxu3MkaPkdm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-06" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CmAKQskKRatMxu3MkaPkdm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kernel.org/" target="_blank">Linux kernel</a> (Android is just another flavor of Linux, mostly) is also included here because it may need to be updated and patched to support newer versions. Qualcomm says it's committed to supplying whatever is needed for two versions of the Android Common Kernel to meet that eight-year window.</p><p>Next, you have Google's monthly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">Android Security Updates</a>. These are <em>really</em> the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-it-safe-use-phone-after-stops-receiving-security-updateshttps://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-it-safe-use-phone-after-stops-receiving-security-updates">most important kinds of updates</a>, but it's hard to get excited about them. Qualcomm is also committed to providing the code to offer these for eight years. This means that no matter which version of Android you happen to be running, it will be as secure as Google can make it. If you replace the battery in your OnePlus 13 several times, and it happens to last until 2033, Android 23 will get the patches it needs to stay secure.</p>
<p>The last kind of update is a little weird, and most of the time, nobody talks about it because consumers never get to see it. Google supports Android versions that <em><strong>aren't</strong></em> new with patches and security updates, too. That means if some company makes a product that works best on a specific version of Android, it's still patched with the latest updates that apply to it.</p><p>Qualcomm is making these changes available so Google can use them to keep old versions maintained, provided the device itself uses a Snapdragon 8 series chip or a 7-series chip launching later this year. I'm sure Google is going to do this, but we won't know until these legacy versions of Android require an update from Qualcomm to work.</p>
<h2 id="now-for-the-not-so-good-news-2">Now for the not so good news</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w2CRtmoK8QjPkZdDugu4ZR" name="Motorola-edge-2022-camera-module-with-flowers.jpg" alt="The camera hump on the back of the Motorola Edge (2022)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w2CRtmoK8QjPkZdDugu4ZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This commitment is nothing but good news, and it's nice to see Qualcomm getting on board with the idea that we should be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-4-what-smartphone-sustainability-really-looks">use our expensive phones longer</a>. I love it, and I'll bet most of us do. It doesn't mean it's going to happen, though.</p><p>It's not going to be free. Nowhere in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/02/qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-with-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's announcement</a> does it claim these changes are going to be free, so nobody should have assumed they would. The current support window isn't free, and it's usually part of the purchase agreement when the chips are ordered; Samsung (for example) negotiates a price to buy 100 million Snapdragon chips and a support package for X number of years from Qualcomm.</p><p>Because this is going to cost money (a good bit of money, from my understanding), phone makers might not choose to pay for it. You or I would pay an extra $10 for a phone we knew would get extra support, but not everyone would, so a phone maker doesn't want to add $10 to the cost of a phone.</p><p>I'm going to peer into a crystal ball and say that phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> will be supported for eight years, but many phones using a "mid-range" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phone/snapdragon-7-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon series 7</a> chip will not. Right now, the OnePlus 13 will receive up to six years of updates, but even though the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, OnePlus may choose not to extend support beyond what it already promised just because Qualcomm says it can.</p><p>It's simply an economic matter, even though customer service and sustainability should never be wholly based on economics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1051px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.65%;"><img id="VXchnSbEKJsmzyHdvy972a" name="qualcomm-update-announcement" alt="A search for the word free in Qualcomm's eight-year update pledge announcement." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VXchnSbEKJsmzyHdvy972a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1051" height="732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, you should know that Qualcomm could do this for past generations of its products, too, but chooses not to. That's also a financial decision and not limited to Qualcomm — every company that makes chips could offer up to a decade of support if it wasn't so costly to task engineers on the project.</p><p>Still, this move makes phones more sustainable and even though phone makers might not be enthusiastic about offering eight years of updates for a phone they already sold, some phones will see it. Maybe those are the ones we should be buying.</p>

<ul><li>Google reiterated its Scam Detection features for the Phone app on Pixels, stating it leverages Gemini Nano for background monitoring.</li><li>The company reportedly stated the feature is on its way to Pixels in March 2025 for the Phone and Messages app.</li><li>Google brought its Scam Detection features to the Phone app beta in November, giving users a glimpse into its functions and warning pop-up.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is gearing up to finally push its scam detection features for all stable Pixel phones.</p><p>The company highlighted its upcoming scam detection features for Pixel phones <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/intl/en/ideas/articles/gemini-nano-offline/">in a Store blog post</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/26/pixel-scam-detection-messages-phone/#more-663079">9to5Google</a>). The post reiterated a few Gemini Nano-backed features users with a Pixel 9 series can find readily available. However, one feature that has yet to debut is the device's scam detection features for the Phone app.</p><p>Google states Gemini Nano "empowers your Pixel to help combat this threat with real-time scam detection during calls." The company says its AI model will analyze conversation "patterns" between you and the other party. The patterns it looks for are most commonly associated/used by scammers. Persons pretending to be a bank rep "urgently" asking for funds or personal information headline the list.</p><p>The post says that if your Pixel 9 picks up on any of these malicious tendencies, it will alert you "immediately."</p><p>More importantly, the publication claims Google is preparing to roll out its scam detection measures to the Phone and Messages app "in March 2025" for Pixels.</p><p>Google first welcomed users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/real-time-scam-detection-is-rolling-out-now-in-google-phone-app-beta">in for scam detection tests</a> in November. After its I/O 2024 preview, Phone app beta users received the Scam Detection toggle in the app. The feature runs in the background of your device, constantly scanning incoming calls you've taken for potential malicious intent. Google informed testers that, when Scam Detection is active, you will hear a beep periodically, signaling its working state.</p><p>If the AI is triggered, users will receive a red pop-up on their device, stating "likely scam." Users can either tap "End Call" or "Not a Scam" if they know the AI got things wrong.</p><p>Like the beta, once this arrives officially, Scam Detection will be disabled by default for privacy reasons. Users will retain the ability to toggle it on or off as they choose within the app's settings. The Messages app's scam features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">entered testing last October</a> as users saw warnings about potentially risky links and more.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that this update <em>could be </em>wrapped in Google's expected March 2025 feature drop for Android 15. Google already started working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-teases-upcoming-android-15-qpr-2-beta-1">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a> back in November after wrapping up what was coming for its December 2024 drop. It was suspected back then that the update was prepared for March 2025 as the company stated its testing would "run through Q1 2025."</p><p>The update will likely drop a month or so before Google's (extremely early) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update for Q2 2025.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing posted another Phone 3a teaser on X, which left people a little confused after its previous one.</li><li>The company showcased a device in white with a smaller, minimalistic vertical triple camera array, mirroring the Pixel 7 Pro's style.</li><li>Two days ago, Nothing talked about the design elements of its Phone 3a Series, which includes the base model and a Phone 3a Pro.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users on X did a double take today (Feb. 26) as Nothing posted another teaser for an upcoming phone.</p><p>Early this morning, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1894703969337024939">Nothing posted a teaser</a> showcasing the rear panel and camera array for a device it claims is in the Phone 3a Series. The company's tagline reads, "Technically refined. Enlightened in every aspect." Many of the comments wondered how this could be as a teaser for the Phone 3a was posted earlier this week — which looked nothing (no pun intended) like this one.</p><p>Today, Nothing's teaser shows a white device with three, curved Glyph lighting LEDs around a vertical camera bar.</p><p>The bar looks quite reminiscent of Google's old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review#section-google-pixel-7-pro-cameras">Pixel 7 Pro</a> as it pits its primary and ultrawide lenses together, but provides a separate cutout for its telephoto. The device Nothing is teasing might follow that same trend as it displays three total lenses in a more minimalistic manner.</p><p>There also appears to be a small camera bump, though it's hard to discern that for sure with a direct view like this.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3a) Series. Technically refined. Enlightened in every aspect. pic.twitter.com/vDJlSh7Iyc<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1894703969337024939">February 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While this may seem confusing to some, it's not entirely, not after you dig into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-shows-off-phone-3a-with-a-massive-camera-bump-in-latest-teaser">a separate teaser</a> two days ago about the Phone 3a <em>and </em>Phone 3a Pro. The device in the short video showed off a gray device with a massive, circular camera housing with three lenses: a 50MP main camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide lens. The triple array also features quite a hefty camera bump, but it's still surrounded by a few of the company's signature Glyph lighting LEDs.</p><p>So, while Nothing had separated the two by name in its teasers, it seems its latest official look is a glimpse into the base Phone 3a model.</p><p>The company's been on a teaser spree recently as it also gave us a brief (vague) look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">Phone 3a's camera button</a>. Similar to Apple's iPhone 16, the Phone 3a Series is expected to receive a camera button, which would let users snap a photo without tapping their display. It's unclear if the button will only feature shutter functions or if it'll take things further like Apple.</p><p>With all the teasers, it's easy to forget that Nothing is gearing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">a March launch</a> for the Phone 3a Series. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.nothing.tech/">sign-ups</a> have begun, users can also expect its flagship Phone 3 to make an appearance "this year," per Nothing's Akis Evangelidis.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, smartwatch displays have one-upped each other by becoming larger, brighter, and smoother than before. The OnePlus Watch 3 display is only the latest to do so, but it's actually ahead of other Android watches in one key display category — in a way that most people would never notice.</p><p>During my colleague Nick Sutrich's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 hands-on</a>, he appreciated how the 1.5-inch AMOLED leaped from 600 to 2,200 nits of brightness and hit a smoother 1–60Hz LTPO refresh rate. But that's fairly standard for mainstream Apple and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> in 2025.</p><p>His real praise was that the display is "comfortable for everyone to use" and "better for your eyes," based on something that you won't find in the Watch 3 specs.</p><p>Grab your phone and photograph any AMOLED smartwatch in direct sunlight, especially with a higher shutter speed. You may notice multiple thick black bars sliding down the display that aren't visible in real life. This is an effect of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">Pulse width modulation (PWM) dimming</a>, a technique that switches a display from 100% to 0% brightness in quick flickers to <em>simulate</em> lower brightness as an intentional optical illusion instead of <em>actually</em> lowering the voltage.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KWfrdugggI0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It's a popular technique across smartphone, tablet, and smartwatch brands, both for preventing AMOLED burn-in and preserving the best color accuracy. But PWM flickering can also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">make you sick without realizing it</a>, starting with subtle eye strain and progressing to headaches or even nausea in the worst cases.</p><p>That's why some phone brands have started offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">DC dimming</a> as an alternative: Lower brightness corresponds with lower voltage without flickering; the colors look less saturated, but late-night phone scrolling won't cause the same problems. These phones only use PWM when the display can hit a high enough frequency to prevent flashing from being visible.</p><p>My colleague Nick Sutrich, who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">gets nauseous from most modern phones</a>, performed the test in the video above and found that the Watch 3 uses DC dimming, preventing any flickering — unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>, which had uncomfortable levels of PWM.</p><p>Does <em>your</em> smartwatch use PWM and strain your eyes? Unless you have a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> or you're a fan of fitness smartwatches, the answer is probably "yes."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dx7zCgbFTTQ9ZzgY7RLyRd" name="Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-PWM-test" alt="A photo of the Apple Watch Ultra 2showing  a single, thin gray bar over the display, indicating that the display uses DC dimming." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dx7zCgbFTTQ9ZzgY7RLyRd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Apple Watch Ultra 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For this smartwatch PWM test, I charged my most recent watch models across several brands with AMOLED displays: Apple, COROS, Garmin, Google Pixel, Polar, Samsung Galaxy, and Suunto watches. Nick had already tested the OnePlus Watch 3, and I asked my colleague Andrew Myrick to test his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Mobvoi TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>.</p><p>Nick told me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> was the first well-known smartwatch that the PWM-sensitive community noticed had switched to DC Dimming, and you can see the evidence in the photo below. With my phone's camera shutter speed set to 1/8000 shutter speed, I could see a solitary, gray line bifurcating the display, with no flickering evident.</p><p>Compare that to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, which also has a 3,000-nit AMOLED display. In this photo, you can see multiple thick black bars that fully block portions of the screen. This is a telltale sign of PWM dimming, because the quick shutter speed is capturing portions of the screen at 0% brightness.</p>

<p>This also applies to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>. Notice how the Pro's display has noticeably thicker black bars than the Classic's; I turned off adaptive brightness for both displays, and the dimmer Pro screen has to flicker at a faster rate to simulate the lower brightness.</p><p>When it comes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> in general, PWM dimming is the standard. I can't say for certain whether the OnePlus Watch 3 is the <em>only</em> one to use DC dimming, as we don't have a Xiaomi Watch 2 on hand and Xiaomi is known for making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-phones-for-pwm-flicker-sensitive">good flicker-free phones</a>. But the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> definitely uses PWM dimming, as does the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a>.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I've found that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a> both seem to use DC dimming, at least on the default brightness setting. I see a bit of flickering on the lowest brightness setting, but the black bars are still significantly thinner than every other brand, which suggests its displays are kinder on your eyes. The same goes for my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.55%;"><img id="uTsh5eRJAAyXfbRujF8Sue" name="garmin-fenix-8-vs-coros-pace-pro-pwm-test" alt="The Garmin Fenix 8 (left) and COROS PACE Pro (right), with the former showing DC dimming and the latter showing PWM dimming." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTsh5eRJAAyXfbRujF8Sue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="913" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Fenix 8 (<em>left</em>) and COROS PACE Pro (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the other hand, two other long-lived running watches — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a> — use PWM dimming. COROS, in particular, seems to use an aggressive form of it, with thicker and faster black bars than I've seen on any smartwatch. The side-by-side shot above should make the difference clear.</p>

<p>We can only speculate on why fitness watches use more eye-friendly dimming than the bigger smartwatch brands; companies typically stay radio silent when asked about this topic.</p><p>The two most likely guesses are battery life and simplicity. Lower voltage instead of flickering would help these watches last longer, in theory, even if the colors aren't as rich. But it could also be a simple case of Garmin and Polar seeing DC dimming as less complicated and easier to implement.</p><p>I haven't tested every smartwatch out there, and this testing method is a bit unreliable unless you check at multiple brightness levels. But the main point is that high-flicker displays are the norm, and only OnePlus and Apple seem to have made a conscious choice to fix that.</p>
<h2 id="pwm-or-dc-dimming-should-be-up-to-the-user-2">PWM or DC dimming should be up to the user</h2>
<p>Plenty of people will go through their lives never being affected by PWM dimming, and since you won't spend as long staring at a smartwatch screen as a phone screen, its flickering may not be as big of an issue. That doesn't change the fact that the switch from LCD or MIP displays to AMOLED on watches could increase eye strain and discomfort.</p><p>That's why I think a simple "PWM or DC dimming" toggle on watches would be the best option. Do you prioritize color fidelity and reduced burn-in or battery life and reduced eye strain? Both options are legitimate, so leave it up to the user!</p><p>Smartwatch displays have other areas where they can improve. The top models have been stuck at about 320 pixels per inch (ppi) for years, while most phones hit between 400–500ppi. And while they've jumped from 30 to 60Hz in recent years, 90Hz or 120Hz seems like the logical next step once we get faster smartwatch SoCs to power them.</p><p>In that context, smartwatch display dimming may not be the priority for these companies when PWM-sensitive people are a relatively niche group — and iPhones, Galaxy phones, and Pixel phones all continue to use PWM exclusively, despite complaints from the PWM-sensitive community. I suspect most Android smartwatches will keep using this tech for years to come.</p><p>Still, I'd at least love to see DC dimming as an option in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> developer settings. And for now, since the OnePlus Watch 3 launch has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-pushes-open-sale-of-watch-3-after-meda-error">delayed to April 2025</a>, anyone on the hunt for a flicker-free watch will either have to switch to an Apple Watch or look seriously at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing announced it's beginning to push its OS v3.0-250218-1552 update to Phone 1 users.</li><li>The update packs a few new features; however, a standout is its inclusion of Google's Circle to Search a month after the Phone 2 got it.</li><li>The Phone 1 received its Android 15 update in January, but it notably missed Google's latest feature for convenient searching.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing is rolling out its latest OS update for the Phone 1, which finally adds a prominent Google feature for users.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/27434-nothing-phone-1-nothing-os-v30-250218-1552-changelog">published the patch notes</a> for the Nothing OS v3.0-250218-1552 update for the Phone 1 and its users. According to one user's post, the update is roughly 202MB as it starts hitting devices this week. Nothing's changelog highlights everything new in this version, such as the Phone 1's long-awaited reception of Google's Circle to Search.</p><p>The company says Circle to Search will be available for the Phone 1 after the patch is downloaded and installed. Moreover, users can "initiate a search" based on any "text, image, or video on your screen." If interested, Nothing says users can toggle Circle to Search by hopping into <strong>Settings > Special features > Gestures Navigation mode > Circle to Search</strong>.</p><p>Users can also surface the feature in two ways: either via its three-button navigation or gesture navigation. Regarding the former, the notes state users can "long-press the Home button" to bring up the feature. Alternatively, you can long-press your navigation bar if it's "not hidden."</p><p>The remainder of the Phone 1's patch notes are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Added power-off password verification to prevent immediate power-off if your phone is lost. Path: Search ‘Power off verify’ in Settings</li><li>Added new wallpapers</li><li>Improved responding speed of Settings</li><li>Optimized Quick Settings pull-down speed in landscape mode</li><li>Enhanced WiFi, Bluetooth and system stability</li><li>Updated to February security patch</li></ul>

<p>Nothing's Phone 1 grabbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-is-finally-here-for-the-nothing-phone-1-and-cmf-phone-1">its major Android 15 update</a> in January alongside the CMF Phone 1; however, it lacked Google's Circle to Search. Despite early feedback appearing positive — for whatever reason — Nothing skipped out such a major feature in the software's original debut. Instead, the feature made its Nothing appearance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-comes-to-phone-2-and-phone-2a">on the Phone 2 and Phone 2a</a>.</p><p>It was made available via an OS 3.0 update, which saw the company highlighting similar surfacing methods for Circle to Search. Nothing mentioned it could roll the update out on Phone 2 series devices "after passing additional testing." So, perhaps something similar occurred with the Phone 1 seeing as it is an older model.</p><p>Also, it's worth noting a point brought up by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/25/nothing-phone-1-circle-to-search/">9to5Google</a>, which is that the Phone 1 is on its last leg of updates. It was made known during its Android 15 update that the OS upgrade <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-15-is-finally-here-for-the-nothing-phone-1-and-cmf-phone-1#:~:text=The%20latest%20update%20for%20the%20Phone%20(1)">would be the last</a> for the Phone 1. Additionally, the device has already entered its final year of security updates.</p>

<ul><li>A set of leaked imagery allegedly depict the upcoming design of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 from Samsung.</li><li>The clamshell largely resembles its Flip 6 predecessor with a tab-like cover display, boasting similar cameras and minimalistic screen changes.</li><li>Rumors claim Samsung could pop its in-house Exynos 2500 chipset into the Flip 7, which was rumored to go toe-to-toe with Qualcomm for efficiency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we gear up for Samsung's usual foldable reveal, a publication claims to have obtained a set of early renderings for its clamshell.</p><p>The imagery was posted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak">Android Headlines</a>, which showcases what consumers might be in for this year with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Leaks suggest the device will look nearly identical to what we received in 2024 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">the Flip 6</a> and in 2023 with the Flip 5. The alleged renderings show the Flip 7 with a familiar tab-like cover display as it makes room for the dual camera array and LED flash.</p><p>Rounded corners seem to continue, as well as a punch-hole selfie camera for its internal display and thin bezels.</p><p>Getting into "specifics," the publication purports the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will see its dimensions grow ever so slightly to 166.6 x 75.2 x 6.9mm. This will reportedly affect its displays (slightly), as it could feature a 3.6-inch cover screen and a 6.8-inch internal screen.</p><p>Internally, the clamshell is rumored to pack Samsung's in-house Exynos 2500 SoC and not Qualcomm's latest like its predecessor. The Korean OEM's stagnant decisions seemingly continue as the post states the Flip 7 boasts the same 50MP primary lens and 12MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Pricing allegedly follows this trend as it's speculated Samsung could offer the Flip 7 at the same Flip 6 starting price: $1,099. This could concern its smaller 256GB storage option — there's also a higher 512GB option, but both supposedly feature 12GB RAM.</p>

<p>Interestingly, these Flip 7 rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">almost mirror a report</a> from December, talking about its displays. It was rumored then that Samsung could upgrade the Flip 7 with better (bigger) displays. The post claimed the foldable could see a 6.8-inch internal display and — finally — a 4-inch cover screen. While the current rumors today line up with the internal one, the cover is still left sitting under that 4-inch mark.</p><p>Even the alleged camera specs leave us wanting more as, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">like a previous rumor</a>, it looks like Samsung isn't interested in upgrading anything. Late January told the tale of a stagnant dual camera setup, as well as its supposed continuation of a 10MP selfie camera. However, those rumors speculate that any noteworthy camera upgrades will arrive via Samsung's Galaxy AI software, not the hardware.</p><p>Also, the idea of Samsung opting for its in-house chip instead of Qualcomm for its foldables was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">highlighted late last year</a>. It was rumored that Samsung might step up its Exynos 2500 by giving it 3x Cortex-X925 cores, 5x Cortex-A725 cores, and 2x Cortex-A520 cores. It might even go toe-to-toe with the Snapdragon 8 Elite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency">for efficiency</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The FDA has signaled approval for the Loss of Pulse Detection feature on the Pixel Watch 3.</li><li>It detects if the user is experiencing "primary cardiac arrest" or "respiratory or circulatory failure."</li><li>Loss of Pulse Detection was previously available in 14 European countries, but will not arrive in the U.S. until late March 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A key draw to the Pixel Watch 3 is its Fitbit-branded health sensors for detecting heart issues. On Wednesday, Google announced that the FDA has given clearance for Loss of Pulse Detection to be used on its smartwatch in the United States, signaling that the feature is accurate enough to be trusted on a consumer device.</p><p>As the name implies, Loss of Pulse Detection can "detect when you’ve experienced a loss of pulse." It will then vibrate with a check-in message before starting an alarm to alert people nearby; if you continue to be unresponsive, it will attempt to call 911 and send an automated message with your location to the emergency responder.</p><p>Google heavily advertised this feature when launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> in September, but while it arrived quickly in 14 countries in the EU and United Kingdom, Google had to get regulatory approval before launching it in the United States. Since this isn't an active feature, many American Watch 3 buyers may have <em>assumed</em> it was available.</p><p>Thankfully, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-fda/">announced</a> that "we’ll begin rolling it out in the U.S. at the end of March," so we won't have too much longer to wait. This feature won't be available on older Pixel Watch models, however.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 sells in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/12652073?hl=en">32 countries</a>, meaning a majority of them still don't have Loss of Pulse Detection. The current list is Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; Google claims that "additional countries will be added as regulatory clearance is obtained."</p><p>While this feature only becomes necessary in drastic circumstances, the Pixel Watch 3 also has more preventative heart health tools. It has an ECG to detect signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib) during active checks, as well as automatic irregular heart rhythm notifications to catch warning signs throughout the day.</p><p>Plus, the Watch 3 can detect if the user experiences a sudden fall or a car crash, with a similar method of calling emergency services if the wearer cannot respond to prompts.</p><p>Among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 is one of the most accurate when it comes to heart rate data, both generally and during workouts, so we're happy to have this feature arriving for worst-case scenarios. And we're curious what new health features will come to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p>

While I have dozens of chargers in the house — I take UGREEN's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">165W Nexode Pro</a> whenever I'm traveling — there isn't another charger that has quite as many features as the P3 Pro. To start with, it has dual USB-C and a single USB-A port, so you can reliably charge three devices at once.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and networking gear.</p></div></div>
<p>There's also a built-in screen that lets you view charging stats in real-time, and I always like chargers and power banks that have this feature; it is a decent enough differentiator on Anker's massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/anker-prime-27650mah-250w-power-bank-review">Prime 27650mAh power bank</a>. Now, where things get interesting is the other features on offer: the P3 Pro has integrated Qi2 connectivity, and you get the ability to charge the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> at 15W via this mode. <br><br>But the biggest advantage is that the charger has a built-in 10000mAh battery, doubling as a power bank. While it is chunkier than other chargers, the inclusion of Qi2 and a decent-sized battery gives it much better versatility. On that note, InfinaCore bundles global travel plugs with the P3 Pro; it comes with the standard U.S. blade plug built into the enclosure, and you can easily attach plugs designated for use in the EU, U.K., Australia, and other parts of the world. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/InfinaCore-Travel-Power-Bank-500mAh/dp/B0DM6NCX8Q">at $68 on Amazon</a>, it doesn't cost that much either.</p>

<p>Basically, you can use the P3 Pro as a dedicated travel charger, and it has passthrough charging — letting you charge connected devices without power going to the internal battery. The design itself is sturdy; the P3 Pro is made out of soft touch plastic, and it has rubber feet at the bottom that ensure it stays planted on a desk. The USB ports and LCD screen are located on the right, and the retractable charging pins are on the left. There's a retractable band next to the charging pins, and you can use this to hook the P3 Pro to the outside of a bag.</p>

<p>The top portion acts as the Qi2 charging mat, and I didn't have any problems charging iPhones and a multitude of Android devices (with the requisite magnetic attachments) with the charger. The internal 10000mAh battery takes a while to charge as it only goes up to 30W, and when you use the P3 Pro as a power bank, you get a maximum of 45W out as the power budget.</p>

<p>To make the most of the 65W charging tech, you'll need to plug it into a wall and use it as a standard GaN charger. Either USB-C port is able to hit 65W, with the USB-A port going up to 18W. It delivers a reliable charge, and I didn't see any issues when using the P3 Pro with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>. I used it as both a power bank and traditional AC charger in the month I had the product, and it did a great job.</p>

<p>The built-in panel shows you real-time charging as well as time left to charge connected devices (or the internal battery), and I'm glad that this feature is included in the device — it makes using it that much more convenient. Overall, InfinaCore nailed the brief with the P3 Pro, and you get a 65W travel charger, Qi2 mat, and 10000mAh power bank all rolled into one device. Considering it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/InfinaCore-Travel-Power-Bank-500mAh/dp/B0DM6NCX8Q">costs just $68</a>, you are getting a good overall value with the product.</p>

For the uninitiated, MWC, or Mobile World Congress, is an annual gathering of all the biggest companies in the mobile tech world. It's here where they show off their latest devices, software, and everything in between. Pretty much anything used to keep you connected to the world around you, you'll find here.</p><p>This year, Android Central will be present at the show to get firsthand experiences with all that MWC has to offer, including upcoming phone launches and more. Be sure to follow our MWC 2025 coverage to stay up-to-date with everything going on at the show.</p><p>Speaking of, what can you expect to see from MWC 2025? While many major announcements from the biggest Android OEMs have shifted away from the show, there are still plenty of companies with exciting things to show off. Here's everything we know we'll see and some things we expect will be present at MWC 2025.</p><p>Also, be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-mwc-2024">2024 Best of MWC</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/coolest-things-mwc-2024">coolest things we saw at MWC 2024</a>.</p>
<h2 id="when-and-where-is-mwc-2">When and where is MWC?</h2>
<p>MWC occurs every year in Barcelona, Spain, at the Fira Barcelona Gran Via convention center.</p><p>MWC is held around the same time every year, usually towards the end of February. This year, however, MWC 2025 will take place from March 3 to March 6. That said, while some announcements happen during the event, many major announcements are expected to occur in the days leading up to MWC.</p><p>You can purchase passes to attend the event at the official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/">MWC website</a>. Prices start at €989 for an Exhibition pass.</p>

<p>With a trade show this large, you can expect there will be plenty of companies fighting for a chance to grab the attention of attendees. At MWC 2024, there were more than 2,700 exhibitors, which highlights just how big this is. That said, it will be a mix of startups and small to large companies, with the large companies taking up the most space and likely the bulk of the attention.</p><p>We won't name every company, here is a list of some notable names we expect to see there:</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj" name="Moto-AI-features-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-3.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHUdW3V8ETfSKaSvqyKesj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There will be no shortage of announcements at MWC from various companies, including those listed above. Not every company will have a major announcement, as some are just there to have presence and show off recently launched devices or features. Here's what we know about what will be shown off at the show from some of the bigger names:</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong></p><p>Google usually skips major announcements at MWC, but that doesn't mean the company isn't present. In fact, we can expect a bit of Google everywhere throughout MWC, and the company will likely have smaller announcements during the event. We also expect the company to be present to let attendees demo its products and software.</p>
<p><strong>Honor</strong></p><p>Honor recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, which features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">one of the best cameras</a> we've seen on a smartphone so far. The company has begun teasing its MWC launch event for March 2 at 16:30 CET, where it will unveil its Alpha Plan, which will focus on the company's latest AI innovations. Honor recently announced that it plans to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-teases-new-ios-cross-device-features-coming-soon">better iOS cross-platform compatibility</a>, something we've been seeing more of from companies like OPPO.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8FWujFUcUiKdBx6VGaUUm4" name="HONOR MWC2025 Save The Date" alt="The Honor Alpha Plan teaser for MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8FWujFUcUiKdBx6VGaUUm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Motorola</strong></p><p>Last year, Motorola wowed us with its unique concept devices, particularly the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-rizr-is-the-sharper-image-of-the-smartphone-world">Motorola Rizr</a> and the phone that could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">wrap around your wrist like a smartwatch</a>. We haven't seen any new hardware concepts from Motorola in a while, so we're not sure what the company has planned for MWC, but we hope the company will talk more about its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a> that it showed off at Lenovo World 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Nothing</strong></p><p>Nothing has been making quite a splash regarding its upcoming launch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">Nothing Phone 3a series</a> is set to be announced at MWC on March 4 at 10:00 GMT and sporting quite an interesting design from what we've seen so far. Nothing has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">teased</a> a pretty impressive camera setup with a 50MP primary sensor and 50MP 3x periscope lens. The Phone 3a series will also be powered by a Snapdragon chipset.</p>

<p><strong>Samsung</strong></p><p>Samsung is another company we don't expect to hear much from at MWC. Last year, Samsung Display showed off a swathe of concept devices, including foldables and rollables, plus a phone that you could seemingly wear on your wrist. The company will likely be back to show off more concepts, but we'll be on the lookout for any notable announcements.</p><p>With any luck, Samsung will give us another glimpse of its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25#section-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, which were teased earlier this year at Galaxy Unpacked.</p>
<p><strong>TCL</strong></p><p>TCL made a splash at CES 2025, showing off its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G</a> with the NXTPAPER Key, which lets users switch to a more eye-friendly display. The phone looked pretty impressive for a budget device exclusive to North America, but TCL left us with a few questions, such as the availability. We know TCL will be showing something off at MWC 2025, so hopefully, we'll get more information about its latest phones.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🎉MWC is coming! 🎉Get ready to explore TCL Mobile's latest offerings at MWC 2025.

<p><strong>TECNO</strong></p><p>TECNO has been making a name for itself, and it's set to make a splash at MWC 2025 with an event lined up where it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-advanced-skin-tone-phantom-ultimate-2-mwc-2025-teaser">teasing new AI features</a>, a new phone in its Camon series, and updates to its Universal Tone technology for improved skin color in images. The company is also teasing the possibility that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">Phantom Ultimate 2</a>, a multi-fold concept phone, may be present at the event, along with what looks like AR glasses. It's safe to say we'll be seeing plenty of products from TECNO at MWC 2025, and while the company hasn't specified an exact launch day/time, we'll be present to cover the major happenings.</p>
<p><strong>Xiaomi</strong></p><p>Xiaomi went for an early pre-MWC reveal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-xiaomi-15-ultra-design-is-out-but-the-camera-may-blow-your-mind">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, showing off the design of a phone that appears to be more camera than phone. We were pretty impressed with the camera from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a>, so we expect big(ger) things from this absolute tank of a unit. The phone launches in China on February 27, but the global launch will happen just days later, on March 2.</p>

<p><strong>ZTE</strong></p><p>Last year, ZTE showed off its affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-flip-5g-review">Nubia Flip 5G</a> and an eyewear-free 3D tablet. It's not clear what's coming this year, especially on the heels of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Nubia Z70 Ultra</a> launch a few months ago, but the company has an event set for March 3 at 1 p.m. CET dubbed "AI for All ZTE Devices New Products Launch Event," so we'll be on the lookout for any exciting news.</p>
<p><strong>AI everywhere</strong></p><p>Of course, no matter where you go, AI will be underscored during nearly every announcement at MWC 2025. Some companies above have teased new AI features, but that's likely just the tip of the iceberg. MediaTek recently unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">new mid-range chips with AI</a> following a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">announcement from Qualcomm</a>. This means more phones will be capable of handling on-device AI tasks, not just the ultra-expensive ones.</p>

<p>SOUNDBOKS sent me an insanely large, nearly 21-kilo package last week. This box encompassed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> of epic proportions. In fact, the speaker was so large in size and made such bold promises I decided to test it out in the field to examine its value.</p><p>I was part of a team arranging a community-centered bazaar in my town over the weekend. This presented itself as the perfect opportunity to test the SOUNDBOKS 4 speaker's prowess. I may have overestimated its capabilities by forgoing a PA system altogether in favor of this mammoth speaker at the venue. You'll find out in a bit if that was a smart decision.</p><p>Sure, 126 decibels sound loud enough for an outdoor event with hundreds of people buzzing around, buying food and other knickknacks from small businesses and vendors. But what looks good on paper hardly ever reflects perfectly in real life, so I was nervous going into this hands-on trial.</p>

<p>First off, the SOUNDBOKS 4 is by no means the cheapest wireless Bluetooth speaker of the sort on the market. You can find plenty of other 200W portable speakers priced well below its $999 price tag and from far more established brands like JBL and Logitech-owned sub-brand Ultimate Ears.</p><p>However, SOUNDBOKS brings something unbeatable to the table: a <strong>40-hour</strong> battery life on the go paired with audio that gets as loud as <strong>126 decibels</strong> thanks to its trio of 72W RMS amplifiers built-in. Even the 200W JBL Partybox 310 only manages to produce about 80 decibels of sound.</p><p>If you run out of juice, the entire battery box — or BATTERYBOKS as the brand likes to call it — slides out of the back and conveniently plugs into any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> and 65W USB-C charger for fast charging. As if that's not enough already, you can buy more of these chunky 12.8 V LiFePO4 batteries separately to always have swappable power when needed. One BATTERYBOKS will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://soundboks.com/products/batteryboks">set you back $149</a>.</p><p>You can also charge the SOUNDBOKS 4 while the BATTERYBOKS is plugged in and hooked up to the speaker. The only drawback here is that this compromises its water-proofing in doing so.</p>

<p>With a soundstage as large and capable as this, the SOUNDBOKS 4 almost sounds good enough to be a PA system replacement for outdoor events and larger parties. Not familiar with PA systems? That's an abbreviation for a public address system that consists of mixers, amplifiers, and speakers all hooked up to create one unified sound system. This kind of system is absolutely necessary for large events and gatherings, be they festivals, bazaars, conventions, parties, concerts, or markets.</p><p>Usually, a decent PA system with wide enough coverage can cost a pretty penny, starting from $500 for incredibly basic ones and going up to $10,000 for premium setups. Instead of renting out a setup like this, I decided to use the SOUNDBOKS 4 for music and announcements at our local bazaar. Since I only had one SOUNDBOKS 4, this left me with one-directional audio, which doesn't sound equally great from every angle of a field or area.</p><p>Still, there were many upsides to this. First of all, had I actually paid $999 for the SOUNDBOKS 4, it would be an investment. After hosting just two large events at $500 a pop per rental, you already get your money's worth instead of renting audio equipment. From the third event onward, it'd be free if you compare it to rental fees.</p><p>The SOUNDBOKS 4 can be paired wirelessly with other SKAA-enabled speakers or other SOUNDBOKS speakers to create a wireless stereo setup, which fixes the multi-directional audio problem.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bluetooth 5.0 means that this speaker isn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast-ready</a>, which is a shame because not everyone has an SKAA-enabled speaker lying around. I really hope the brand refreshes this gigantic rugged Bluetooth speaker once the Bluetooth Auracast standard is readily available.</p>

<p>Of course, if you want to connect something via cables, like a mixer, an amp, a musical instrument, or a microphone, you can do so very easily. The SOUNDBOKS 4 has one AUX in and one AUX out port, as well as dual 1/4” XLR inputs to hook up relevant audio or video equipment.</p><p>There are three connectivity modes on the speaker, and you can set up a PIN to restrict connection. This is managed through the mobile app, which is also where you can manage audio presets and access the custom equalizer.</p><p>Not to mention, the goliath has a perfectly sized hole at the bottom for mounting on a standard speaker mount. This, in effect, can help you create a wireless PA system that's also waterproof and doesn't need cables to connect, beating out the current systems that are widely used and rely on grounded sources of power or generators.</p><p>Admirably, the speaker's IP65 water-resistant rating is true to its word. Believe me, did I put that to the test? In the midst of the bazaar, heavy rain came pouring down upon my crew and me. The entire venue was nearly flooded, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 kept blasting on, pumping music to lift our (literally) dampened spirits.</p><p>My biggest qualm about the SOUNDBOKS 4 was its weight and size. Although there are handles carved into both sides of the outdoor speaker, it's way too heavy for me to carry. If you have special medical conditions that restrict you from picking up hefty loads, you'll need an extra pair of hands or two to help you transport the darn thing.</p><p>As the rain stilled and the sun came out again at the bazaar, the SOUNDBOKS 4 continued to function. It lasted through a scorching hot day, quickly becoming a storm without any technical errors. My team of organizers had originally intended to rent a PA system, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 was sufficient for music and small announcements during the event.</p><p>If you're someone who hosts big parties or events regularly, I highly recommend the SOUNDBOKS 4. This speaker sounds better from a distance, which is just nice for the outdoors. It can actually replace a PA system and bring extras to the table, such as portability and waterproofing. For best results, though, I suggest getting two of these bad boys to create a stereo sound system that's loud enough for a gathering of 200 people.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced that it will be extending support to devices with its latest chipset for up to eight years.</li><li>Smartphones that feature the Snapdragon 8 and 7 series will be eligible to receive this support.</li><li>By collaborating with Google, this move is said to increase both device longevity and sustainability while making sure that these phones get the latest OS for eight years.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/onq/2025/02/qualcomm-extends-support-for-updates-on-android-devices-with-snapdragon-8-elite">announced this week</a> that it will be teaming up with Google to bring 8 years of updates to new and upcoming Android devices that have the new Snapdragon 8 series chipset or the Snapdragon 7 series chips coming later this year.</p><p>In a press release, the company stated that this will roll out to devices that are running on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> Mobile Platform. This means phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-and-13r-launch">OnePlus 13</a>, the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-xiaomi-15-ultra-design-is-out-but-the-camera-may-blow-your-mind"> Xiaomi 15</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-is-the-best-gaming-phone-and-its-here-in-the-us">Asus ROG Phone 9 </a>are all among the devices included to potentially receive up to eight consecutive years of Android software and security updates.</p><p>This essentially means that the company promises to provide not just Android system updates but also underlying "kernel" updates (the core of the software, seemingly making it cheaper for manufacturers to provide these yearly upgrades.</p><p>"Through this collaboration, OEMs can more seamlessly update the software and security on their devices, ensuring a more secure and long-lasting Android experience for our users," said Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform.</p><p>Qualcomm is said to offer device manufacturers like the ones mentioned above the ability to bring Android software and security updates. Google has already done this since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">Galaxy S25 series</a>. Now, it looks like Google is trying to bring that same level of support to other phones on the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-02" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Qualcomm adds that the OEM decides whether or not a specific device will come with the extended updates. This means that it will be up to Samsung, OnePlus, or any other manufacturer to decide the level of support these phones will receive.</p><p>"We are raising the bar, providing more flexibility for our OEMs and ultimately enhancing user experiences," said Chris Patrick, Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets.</p><p>This collab comes with a respite, as customers will potentially get to keep their devices for longer instead of upgrading to new phones every couple of years. This is particularly good for phones with the 7-series chips coming later this year, meaning cheaper devices could also receive extended support usually reserved for premium phones.</p><p>That said, it's a bummer that older phones, which don't have the latest chipsets, will not get any of these benefits, which means users may have to upgrade to recent-generation phones soon.</p><p>"Legacy platforms cannot take advantage of the extended support. Qualcomm Technologies will continue to work with OEMs on their software support needs for legacy platforms across our product lines," the presser added.</p>

The brand's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-used-dockcases-new-magsafe-ssd-enclosure-with-my-pixel-9-pro-xl-and-it-was-great">Smart MagSafe M.2 SSD Enclosure</a> built on this unique design and included an M.2 2230/2242 that can be easily connected to your phone, and I put it to good use with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. <br><br>Dockcase is now integrating the M.2 SSD connectivity into its USB-C hubs with the Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 with M.2 SSD Enclosure. As the name suggests, the 7.-in-1 hub has a built-in M.2 slot, so you can easily add an SSD to the hub and increase its versatility. I like this idea as it makes a regular USB-C hub that much more versatile, and if you like what you're seeing, you can get your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dockcaseexplorerepro/dockcase-smart-usb-c-hub-7-in-1-with-m2-ssd-enclosure">hands on the dock for $129</a> while it's being crowdfunded at Kickstarter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zeDtSpmx5Px9uFPz3jcdLJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zeDtSpmx5Px9uFPz3jcdLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I'm wary of recommending crowdfunded projects, Dockcase has a proven history of delivering products, and it uses Kickstarter as a way to gauge demand before starting production, so there shouldn't be any inherent risk in this regard. Also, the hub will cost $179 once it goes on sale at Dockcase's website, so you're essentially saving $50 this way.</p>

<p>Anyway, let's start with the design. The Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 has the same design as other Dockcase products, so you get a black rectangular chassis made out of aluminum with a matte texture, and a large screen dominating the top. Build quality is among the best of any USB-C hub I used, and while it is a bit bigger than most hubs, it still has decent portability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xY6uyWM2MEipHmmAeDgvSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xY6uyWM2MEipHmmAeDgvSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the hub stands out is the inclusion of the M.2 slot. It's housed within the enclosure, and you can easily slot in any standard M.2 2230 or M.2 2242 SSD in the dock, and it takes drives up to 2TB. Dockcase bundled a 128GB SK Hynix white-label SSD so I can test the hub, but I switched it out with Corsair's MP600 Mini, and it held up just as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mZy9G8eDdxFcUtscBd5sSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZy9G8eDdxFcUtscBd5sSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the hub is that there's a small fan built into the enclosure, and it does a great job managing the thermals of the M.2 drive. The bottom of the hub is ventilated to allow hot air to exit the chassis, and I didn't see any issues with the drive or the enclosure getting too hot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S3izWJGL7y9J48FTSsMjSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3izWJGL7y9J48FTSsMjSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to connectivity, you get a USB-C port, USB-A connector, SD card reader, HDMI port, TF card reader, and a secondary USB-C connector that can be used to charge PD devices at up to 100W. The seventh port is used to connect the hub to a Windows or macOS machine via USB-C.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5BojEzNKnyemrHqqi56P8J" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BojEzNKnyemrHqqi56P8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The built-in screen has a touch interface, and you can easily see all devices plugged into the hub and change settings. It shows the status of the built-in SSD — including real-time transfers and storage left — and you can also view PD charging info. There's the ability to adjust the speed of the fan; it's on auto out of the box, but you can set it up to always be at 70% to 100% via the settings. The fan makes an audible noise, but it doesn't get too loud.</p>

<p>Overall, the Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 with M.2 SSD Enclosure does a good job as a USB-C hub, and the built-in M.2 slot makes it easy to add an SSD to the hub. It is a good option if you want to extend USB ports alongside the storage of your notebook (or phone) via a unified device, and at $129, it is a decent value.</p>

<ul><li>Google is updating Gemini Live to be "more dynamic and engaging," thanks to a new model, and the update is beginning to roll out.</li><li>You can check if you're using the new version of Gemini Live by viewing your Gemini Apps Activity logs. If they include audio files, you're using the latest Gemini Live version.</li><li>The new version of Gemini Live doesn't appear to be widely rolling out; at least one Pixel 9 Pro XL user has it.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is beginning to roll out changes to Gemini Live it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">announced earlier this month</a>, including the "even more dynamic and engaging" conversations, albeit in limited fashion. The change was spotted by at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ixn3un/native_audio_input_in_gemini_live_just_rolled_out/" target="_blank">one Reddit user</a> on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. The new version of Gemini Live doesn't pack any visual changes to the UI, but it does include tweaks to data collection, which is how you can figure out whether you're using the new or old Live.</p><p>When the company previewed the changes in an email to Gemini Live users, it noted that the new version of Live would soon store "audio, video, and screen shares" in Gemini Apps Activity. As such, that's precisely how you can identify if you have received the updated Gemini Live experience (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/25/new-gemini-live-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). After opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> and tapping your profile image, pressing <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> will show a transcript if you're using the old Live.</p><p>The new version of Gemini Live includes the actual audio files from your conversation, as explained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ixn3un/native_audio_input_in_gemini_live_just_rolled_out/" target="_blank">u/evelyn_teller</a> on Reddit. "I was able to 100% verify that it was native audio input because the Google Gemini apps activity page included all the raw audio snippets of me speaking to Gemini live, with all the background noise," the Redditor explained in a comment.</p><p>The Redditor also notes that the new version of Gemini Live is "pretty good at recognizing different languages, even less common ones like my native language when I spoke it without explicitly telling that I'm switching the language."</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, this update does not appear to be widely rolling out yet. Android Central checked its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and neither had the new Gemini Live experience.</p><p>Here's how Google explained the Gemini Live changes in its original email: "Google is starting to roll out updates to Gemini to make your conversations even more dynamic and engaging...With our latest model, Live can better understand multiple languages, dialects, or accents in a single Live chat and help with your translation needs."</p><p>It's important to note that Google's privacy policy is changing as it relates to Gemini Live. With the new update, your audio inputs will be recorded and saved. Eventually, when Gemini Live supports video (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>) and screenshares, those will be saved too.</p><p>"As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5r_VZJXj-0CEZg0HMLcsbjRwAsrOtRS1mQA5HOQpeS4OQ6iIFGQMR-3zzNz2Tr_5ni-I8y5GQRCszWKXFKIM5XYvsTiLXfOWK6QNEK2rKm2ZY1yES9axb5npns7wIgwQ8Xb6I4uynNamH2jEaM57JIRkEnqyYqnNnkGDt-5A_0" target="_blank"><strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong></a> (if it’s on)," Google explained.

<p>MediaTek is bringing consumers another tech debut; however, this one will be on deck for its MWC 2025 presence.</p><p>According to a company press release, MediaTek is introducing consumers and OEMs to its latest M90 modem for smartphones. The post states this new modem is a 5G-Advanced cellular modem solution that "aligns" with 3GPP Release 17 and the upcoming Release 18 specifications. Leading off its advancements is MediaTek's Modem AI technology. It's stated that this technology will "enhance" the modem's power efficiency and device performance.</p><p>To succeed, MediaTek states its AI models will assist the modem in identifying traffic patterns to "optimize power consumption and latency." The modem will also leverage its AI software to improve your connectivity by detecting usage scenarios and "device orientation." The M90 modem takes its AI models and incorporates them with MediaTek's Smart Antennae technology.</p><p>The Taiwanese company states this will allow the modem to boost data throughput by roughly 30% for an optimized experience.</p><p>With a focus on your data, MediaTek says the M90 modem offers a downlink performance of up to 12Gbps and boosts its uplink capabilities by 20%. The modem also supports sub-6GHz and mmWave, as well as dual 5G SIM dual-active support — with data capabilities for both.</p><p>MediaTek is integrating its satellite connectivity technology (NTN) with proper support for low-rate and high-rate data services. The modem's UltraSave tech is said to extend a device's battery life by reducing its power consumption by 18%.</p><p>The MediaTek M90 modem is still in the testing phase to ensure it meets industry standards. Samples of the new modem are expected to be available during the second half of 2025.</p>
