<hr>
<p>Google is revamping ChromeOS on the digital assistant front, swapping out the familiar Google Assistant for the newer, smarter Gemini.</p><p>On Tuesday, March 18, Google officially announced the rollout of the stable ChromeOS M134 update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/gemini-google-assistant-chromebooks/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Now, when users try to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> on their Chromebooks, they'll be redirected to the Gemini app, according to the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/331983080/introducing-chrome-os-m134-to-the-stable-channel" target="_blank">community post</a>.</p><p>This move is part of Google’s bigger plan to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">replace Google Assistant with the AI-powered Gemini across all devices</a>, from phones and wearables to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:579px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:113.82%;"><img id="PeuVWNih2Er76i8pEVs35g" name="gemini-on-chromebooks" alt="app launcher on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeuVWNih2Er76i8pEVs35g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="579" height="659" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest ChromeOS update kicks off Google’s step-by-step plan to replace Google Assistant with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> on Chromebooks. Once the switch is fully done, you’ll spot the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the app launcher. For now, though, don’t expect to summon Gemini with a “Hey Google” since voice commands aren’t on the table just yet.</p>
<h2 id="web-like-gemini-experience-2">Web-like Gemini experience</h2>
<p>After updating to the latest ChromeOS build, tapping the Assistant feature will now take you straight to the Gemini Progressive Web App (PWA). It’ll feel just like using Gemini on the web, complete with handy perks like uploading files and deep research.</p><p>For clarity, Gemini was already accessible on ChromeOS, but this update makes it the default, fully replacing Google Assistant as the main digital assistant.</p><p>Furthermore, ChromeOS 134 also debuts “Slow Keys,” an accessibility feature that helps users with motor impairments or arthritis type more accurately. It adds a customizable delay before keystrokes register, which can be adjusted in the Accessibility settings.</p>

<p>ChromeOS 134 also spices things up with an upgrade to the Quick Insert feature. Now you can drop GIFs straight into chats or documents using the Quick Insert menu.</p><p>Google’s rolling out this update in phases, so don’t be surprised if you don’t see the Gemini interface pop up right after installing the latest software.</p>

My biggest annoyance with the Apple Watch is that it's unmistakably a tech product; it doesn't look or feel like an actual watch.</p>

<p>This is where hybrid smartwatches come into the equation. These products look like regular watches, but they come with the usual smarts that you'd associate with a smartwatch, including health and activity tracking, workout logging, and even blood oxygen and ECG monitoring. So when Withings asked if I wanted to take a look at the ScanWatch Nova, I was interested. <br><br>I knew Withings made hybrid smartwatches, but I didn't pay particular attention to its products, so I had no idea what to expect with the ScanWatch Nova. I liked the design and thought it was an intriguing product, but it's only after I started using it that I understood its true potential. <br><br>Now, before we get started, you'll need to know that the ScanWatch Nova is pricier than most smartwatches in the market, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> and Huawei Watch Ultimate demand a higher price. The hybrid smartwatch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Withings-HWA10-model-7-WITHINGS-Scanwatch-Nova/dp/B0CP25YM8K">costs $599 on Amazon</a>, and that's twice what you'd pay for a standard Galaxy Watch 7.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5mbVSMtd6qWkrNxmgaoYje" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mbVSMtd6qWkrNxmgaoYje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Withings justifies the cost by delivering what is the best-looking hybrid smartwatch around. The ScanWatch Nova has a gorgeous design, and the dive-inspired dial immediately allows it to stand out. I'm a huge fan of Citizen's products — I own a half-dozen Promaster watches — and the Nova looks like the Promaster Dive. It even gets a Super-LumiNova coating that allows the indices and hands to glow in the dark.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nova has a 42mm watch face, and it has a stainless steel case with polished edges, a ceramic rotating bezel, steel rotating crown, and anti-reflective strengthened glass. The watch has a metal bracelet out of the box, but Withings includes a fluoroelastomer band in the package, along with the requisite tools to adjust the links on the metal band, which is a nice touch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vpnTQE9k9AvHDMQvwLcWoe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpnTQE9k9AvHDMQvwLcWoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the ScanWatch Nova is available in black, blue, and green dials, and I went with the green option as that looks particularly striking. The Nova still looks pristine after a month of use that included travel to three countries, and that's after my 21-month-old got a hold of the watch and decided to throw it about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7PG534xvfrXsUEHiSsadqe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PG534xvfrXsUEHiSsadqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design combined with the attention to detail makes the ScanWatch Nova one of the best-looking watches around, and the elegant design is a clear selling point. Coming in at 63g, the Nova isn't heavy that you'd notice, but it has the right amount of heft to feel like a regular watch — this is an issue with most smartwatches, which end up being too light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xS3wKvdFNmdoennQpd54pe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xS3wKvdFNmdoennQpd54pe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At a quick glance, it isn't evident that the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, and the only indicator to its smarts is the 0.63-inch dial that houses an OLED panel. It is a monochrome panel with a pixel density of 282PPI, and text looks clear without any fringing. <br><br>Text is easily readable even under sunlight, and while the size of the panel means you're limited in what notifications show up on the watch, it wasn't a big problem as such. It's easy to navigate the menus via the rotating crown, and you can view heart rate info and activity data with relative ease.</p>

<p>Although the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, it has a full suite of health monitoring sensors. You get an optical module to measure heart rate, an SpO2 sensor, a new TempTech24/7 sensor that measures skin temperature throughout the day, and an electrocardiogram module that lets you take ECG readings on the watch itself. <br><br>In this regard, the Nova is just as good as a regular smartwatch, and if anything, Withings has an edge thanks to ECG readings. The feature does a good job, and even with regular heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, the Nova held its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a>. <br><br>There's also a cardio check-up that's bundled with the Withings+ subscription. I'm not a fan of subscriptions, and I don't quite see the point of Withings+; it has workouts and meal plans, and provides a scorecard based on your health and activity data, and while I used the trial, I didn't see enough value in paying $10 a month. Considering the cost of the Nova, Withings should have offered a free year of Withings+, but that isn't the case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.73%;"><img id="wMokisMcyyRKqTyPL3JHbZ" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova activity monitoring data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wMokisMcyyRKqTyPL3JHbZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4400" height="3200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to activity monitoring, the ScanWatch Nova does a good job logging steps, and it even has automatic activity detection. I tested it with my indoor bike, and while it took a little while to notice the activity, it logged it without any intervention. The data is in line with other smartwatches I tested, and while you don't get much metrics on the Nova itself, the mobile app does a great job highlighting activity data. <br><br>The only issue in this area is that the Nova doesn't include a built-in GPS, so if you're running outdoors, you'll need to bring your phone along. That is an annoyance, and other than this omission, there isn't anything missing on the smartwatch. I had no issues with notifications either, and while not as customizable as a regular smartwatch, it serves the need — and that's what I want.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage with a hybrid smartwatch is battery life, and the ScanWatch Nova excels in this area. I got close to three weeks of battery life before having to charge the smartwatch, and not having any battery anxiety is a genuine differentiator. The Nova uses a custom charging cradle, and it takes over two hours to charge, but you'll only be doing so once a month. <br><br>Ultimately, the ScanWatch Nova does everything I need in a smartwatch, but it doesn't look or feel like one, and the elegant design combined with extensive health and activity monitoring make it a great — if costly — choice. I used the watch for a month now, and in that time, I didn't feel the need to go back to the Apple Watch — which in itself is the highest praise I can give the Nova.</p>

Google highlights it as one way to enhance graphics, while the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) can dynamically scale graphics in a game when your phone gets hot. It's a two-pronged attack that aims to solve real-world issues with mobile gaming.</p>

<p>My colleague Andrew Myrick talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-16-looks-to-be-even-better-for-gamers-than-we-expected">how Vulkan will help accelerate gaming</a> on dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handheld Android consoles</a>, but what about phones? Several Android games already utilize Vulkan to help accelerate performance and include advanced graphics features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-galaxy-s24-support-ray-tracing">like ray-tracing</a>. Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Pokemon TCG Pocket, Summoners War: Chronicles, Diablo Immortal, and PUBG: New State all use Vulkan by default.</p><p>While Vulkan concentrates on providing advanced graphics options and enabling more efficient multicore performance, ADPF ensures that games run at a consistent rate no matter how long you play. If I've learned anything about high-end processors, it's that they tend to run very hot after 30-minute (or longer) gaming sessions.</p><p>Nothing makes a high-end phone feel more disappointing than when your favorite game still runs terribly on it after just 30 minutes of game time. That's where I think ADPF is going to come in clutch, as it'll help games scale graphics quality on-the-fly to match the thermal requirements of your phone, keeping the frame rate high all the time while ensuring the best graphics possible throughout.</p>

<p>Don't confuse Vulkan for the Star Trek race of the same pronunciation. Vulkan is a replacement for Open GL, a graphics library that's been around since 1992 but has been substantially upgraded since. While Open GL has been great for a long time, its existence is a little long in the tooth and it doesn't support many modern graphics features.</p><p>A glance at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/rendering-features-for-mobile-games-in-unreal-engine">latest Unreal Engine features table</a> will show you substantial differences in capability when using Vulkan versus Open GL ES, mostly related to lighting and texture quality on mobile devices. It also enables new technologies like ray-tracing which makes lighting and reflections substantially more realistic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.57%;"><img id="29d6Cv3aWskTMCJhY9Bxnj" name="diablo-immortal-ray-tracing-on-off" alt="A comparison of ray-tracing capabilities in Diablo Immortal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29d6Cv3aWskTMCJhY9Bxnj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Activision Blizzard)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about performance? Vulkan was built with multicore processors in mind while Open GL has historically done a poor job of utilizing all the lovely cores that are packed inside a processor like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>So I put it to the test against several different classes of phones including flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, mid-range offerings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a>, and budget options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, and older phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a>. What I found was incredibly disappointing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vulkan isn't a silver bullet or a magic trick. It can offer better performance but often requires a lot of work to make that happen in existing games.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For the test, I ran a few games and benchmarks that allow you to choose between Open GL ES and Vulkan. I also used the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme benchmark, specifically, as well as PUBG: New State and the Dolphin emulator. Each of these options all ran better in Open GL ES than on Vulkan. This seems like a paradox considering Vulkan is heralded as a paradigm-shifter in performance, but a lot of this depends highly on the game in question and the hardware it's running on.</p><p>The 3DMark test on the OnePlus Nord N30, which runs on a 2022 Snapdragon 695 chipset and Android 14, performed quite a bit worse using Vulkan than Open GL. Graphic test 1 ran 2FPS slower on average using Vulkan, while the physics test was 50% <em>slower</em> than using Open GL. I expected exactly the opposite.</p><p>OK, so how about newer hardware? The Nothing Phone 3a uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> which debuted two and a half years after the Snapdragon 695. The phone also runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, yet we see a similar pattern. The graphics test portion was a wash between the two APIs — 0.5 FPS faster on one test and 0.5 FPS slower on the second — while the physics test was nearly 100% slower running on Vulkan. Wow.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Building a game in Unity using the Vulkan backend exposes features that simply aren't available with Open GL, stressing the importance of Vulkan-only development going forward.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>PUBG: New State and the Dolphin emulator didn't seem to benefit from Vulkan, either. On the three lower-end phones, Open GL ran Dolphin a few FPS better than Vulkan. I didn't see any difference between the two APIs in PUBG: New State. I couldn't find anything that stressed the OnePlus 13 enough to find a difference between Vulkan and Open GL, either.</p><p>If you expected Vulkan to give old games an immediate performance boost on older hardware, you might want to adjust those expectations. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-improve-performance-valheim">I previously wrote about</a> how much Vulkan improved performance in games like Valheim, which saw an immediate 50% performance increase when using Vulkan on certain hardware. That gave me false hope, as it turns out things are a lot more complex than I imagined.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Dp2JFVCEAZoK6Ezjfmi5Zg" name="open-gl-vs-vulkan-pubg-new-state-oneplus-nord-n30" alt="Comparing performance between Open GL and Vulkan in PUBG New State on a OnePlus Nord N30" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dp2JFVCEAZoK6Ezjfmi5Zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>,To get a better understanding of why this strange dichotomy occurs, I spoke to the developer of the highly-rated game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/grab/4104088956355944/">GRAB on the Meta Quest</a>, Slin, who told me Vulkan "can be a silver bullet, but only in some cases and only if done right." GRAB uses a custom Vulkan-based engine rather than big names like Unreal or Unity.</p><p>"It does, for example, have this subpass feature which allows to do some basic post-processing on mobile without the major performance hit" you'd usually get from Open GL.</p><p>Vulkan works very well on Quest and other Snapdragon-based mobile chipsets but some engines, like Unity, don't always offer an easy way to switch from Open GL and get the best performance. But building a game in Unity using the Vulkan backend exposes features that simply aren't available with Open GL, stressing the importance of Vulkan-only development going forward.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android 16's Vulkan requirement ensures that new games have access to the best new graphics features.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Games like Valheim were likely putting more strain on the CPU using Open GL, while Vulkan freed up the process and let the GPU do more work. However, implementing Vulkan in an existing game is a lot of work. Translating the old language — Open GL — into the new Vulkan language is a skill some people will inherently be better at than others.</p><p>I hoped that enabling Vulkan would be like flipping a switch, but that's simply not the case. "My guess is that it’s a problem with Unity retrofitting it into their huge legacy codebase and having to make it work well for everyone with every feature," Slin told me.</p><p>Vulkan certainly can boost performance under the right circumstances but it's not likely that <em>old</em> games will see much difference even if it's natively implemented. Other people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_mBi74eldQ">came to the same conclusion</a> when comparing the two, but Android's switch to Vulkan-only should help in the future.</p><p>What you should expect is that games like Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile were able to deliver better graphics in a <strong>new</strong> game using Vulkan. In other words, this change is forward-thinking rather than for backward compatibility, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is likely to deliver more of a difference than current versions of Android.</p>

<p>Adding ray-tracing to the ice reflections in Diablo Immortal is cool but <em>very few</em> people are going to be able to notice the nuance differences feature like ray-tracing add to a game on a 6-inch screen. Rather, mobile gamers want better and more <strong>consistent</strong> performance out of their mobile games.</p><p>A number of games with crazy good graphics — like Fortnite, Call of Duty, Diablo, etc — support automatic graphics scaling that aims to keep your frame rate as smooth as possible, but the calculation to get there isn't exactly <em>intelligent</em>. Games that support dynamic visual scaling features often base this scaling on sheer performance numbers. If the game was running at 60FPS when it started but is now dropping to sub-50 FPS, the game will change the resolution, texture quality, or other assets to raise the frame rate again.</p><p>While this isn't a bad idea, it doesn't take device thermals into account. Sure, reducing these values will reduce CPU and GPU load which will eventually lower the temperature of your device, but without knowing the actual temperature it's difficult for a game to understand why and when it needs to scale. That's where Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) comes in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FzyJtT9sqBWkTZCLSQU28X" name="lineage-w-official-screenshot" alt="An official screenshot of Lineage W on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FzyJtT9sqBWkTZCLSQU28X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NCSOFT)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>ADPF ensures a consistent framerate across a wide portfolio of devices, ensuring more users see better gaming performance overall.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>ADPF was announced over a year ago but, as with many things, implementing it takes time. In a nutshell, ADPF allows the game and the system to talk to and understand each other in a way that wasn't possible before. Games can now understand how hot a phone gets and <em>why</em> it's getting so hot, helping to schedule upcoming graphics quality changes to keep the phone from getting hot in the first place.</p><p>The chart below shows the sustained performance difference after 30 minutes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kakaogames.ares">Ares: Rise of Guardians</a> between running the game at the highest graphics settings and a second session where ADPF was enabled. Pay specific attention to the yellow line. The improvement couldn't be greater.</p><p>During the high-quality graphics test, the game's frame rate hovered just under 30FPS with slight drops to 25FPS. By 10 minutes in, the game was wildly fluctuating between 15FPS and 28FPS. By the roughly 23-minute mark, the game held steady at an unplayable 15FPS.</p><p>Meanwhile, with ADPF enabled, the game was able to maintain a consistent 25-30FPS throughout the <em>entire</em> 30-minute play session. In addition to that, the thermal profile graphs were managed much better, keeping the device under the thermal warning level for longer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:30.92%;"><img id="eA7uxndgXSDxkFzvPYRMQ8" name="ares-android-dynamic-performance-framework-example" alt="Two performance graphs detailing the difference that Android Adaptability and Android Dynamic Performance Framework can make in delivering a consistent frame rate in games." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eA7uxndgXSDxkFzvPYRMQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2400" height="742" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Kakao Games)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's a brilliant way to implement device intelligence and share pertinent information that helps everything work better together. While ADPF still needs to be implemented for each game — again, this isn't a switch that Google can magically turn on or off — it represents a greater possibility to provide more consistent performance across a wider portfolio of devices than anything else we've seen before.</p><p>It's here where I think the vast majority of users will see the biggest improvement. Mid-range devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Samsung Galaxy A-series</a> are often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">the best-sellers</a> in any given quarter, and it's these phones that'll likely see the biggest impact with dynamic graphics scaling. Being able to push the best graphics during the slow parts of a game could result in a big wow factor for new phones and games, ultimately driving people to play games on their phones even more than they already do.</p>

<ul><li>Google Play Store keeps sending multiple update notifications to Pixel and Samsung users.</li><li>These notifications seem to be coming from first-party Google apps needing an update, even though they've been updated to the latest version.</li><li>Dismissing these notifications doesn't seem to make them go away, as they keep recurring after a few minutes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recently, Google went on a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> mass deletion spree</a> and took down several apps on Play Store that were part of a massive Ad fraud that engulfed them. Today (Mar. 18), Android users are frustrated with some kind of bug that's taken over the Play Store —sending constant notifications asking them to update the app.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/update-google-play-services/">9to5Google</a>, these notifications were being sent by first-party apps like Google Messages, Google Search etc. Asking users to update the app, otherwise they won't function properly.</p><p>However, once users click on the notification they're taken to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&pli=1">Google Play Store's home page</a>, all in vain; since the apps don't show any update available to be installed. The latest updated version available as of now is  v25.09.33.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A phantom Google Play services update prompt in Google Messages as of this morning. pic.twitter.com/pxvrDy1Dnu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902011447082918237">March 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>That's not all, the most frustrating thing that users say is that this notification never goes away. It keeps popping up every couple of minutes even after being dismissed, more like a loopy bug.</p><p>This bug seems to be impacting all Android devices users including Google Pixel and Samsung phone owners. One such Pixel user took to Reddit indicating that they had been dealing with this issue all morning and even tried to, reboot the phone as well and delete cache and storage for Google Play Services and Google Play Store, but that didn't do much either. The notification kept coming back with different Google apps showing up in the notifications tab.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1je3twx/update_google_play_services/">user stated</a> "This is occurring on my S25 Ultra but not my Pixel 9 Pro XL. The Ultra is running version 25.09.62 while the Pixel is running version 25.10.33. Both are on non-beta firmware."</p><p>Some have even suggested checking for any updates by heading to <strong>Security & privacy > Updates. </strong>However, as of now, there seems to be no fix in sight. Android Central has reached out to Google about this ongoing bug and will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>It is important to note that any troubleshooting steps that users have mentioned on Reddit threads are simply suggestions and aren't official guidelines to fix the issue.</p>

<ul><li>In the latest Android 16 beta 3, the battery icon features a dynamic color scheme, changing to red when the battery is low and vibrant green when charging.</li><li>The traditional five-segment Wi-Fi signal indicator is also reduced to three segments offering a streamlined appearance.</li><li>These visual updates are found hidden in the latest beta and are not enabled by default and might change before the official release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 16 is the next awaited operating system release from Google, and the search giant has already rolled out betas for its Pixel phones. New findings from the latest beta suggest that we could be seeing significant changes in UI elements starting with the battery icon.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman’s findings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-new-battery-icon-3534047/">Android Authority</a>), Google seems to be working on new status bar icons with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> operating system. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 beta 3</a> has shown Rahman some changes to the status bar icons, which indicate Wi-Fi signal strength and battery level.</p><p>The Wi-Fi icon, over the years, has showcased five segments indicating the signal strength, which is now being shifted to only three segments. It seems to be a nifty little change with the upcoming Android 16. Similarly, the battery icon has remained unchanged for quite some time now, which appears to be notably changing its colors this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hFh2eghhf5irp7E9qSVwGB" name="Android-16-revamped-battery-and-wifi-icon" alt="Android 16 revamped battery and Wi-Fi icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFh2eghhf5irp7E9qSVwGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman notes that the white background on the battery icon will now have a dynamic color scheme. Solid white remains in the background when the phone’s battery is fully or sufficiently charged. It will turn red when the battery is too low and not charging. However, the other significant change happens to be when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is charging because it now showcases a vibrant green color.</p><p>Furthermore, the battery icon is also flipped to a horizontal orientation as opposed to the previous iteration, which had a vertical orientation. Also, there is a new, bolder font for the battery level percentage indication. These new status bar icons aren’t enabled by default in the Android 16 beta 3 and are enabled manually, which could mean that it could still be in the testing phase and may or may not make it live when the official version rolls out.</p>

<p>It isn’t the first time that Google has tested the revamp of status bar icons, including the battery. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-major-design-changes-status-bar-icons">Last April</a>, Android 15’s developer preview also suggested a possible revamp happening to the status bar icons. However, the revamped battery icon didn’t make it to the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> release later.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors claim Samsung is encountering resistance with one of its Exynos SoCs, which could hinder its cheaper Flip.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202503131628018800108339&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00">The Bell</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly unsure if its next clamshell foldable will rock the Exynos 2500 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/latest-galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumor-exynos-2500-haters-love/">SamMobile</a>). More specifically, the report claims the chip was seen as the chip of choice for the "Galaxy Z Flip FE" that's been rumored for a while now.</p><p>Originally, the report states the chip was supposed to enter mass production in 2024, but that never happened. The publication's alleged industry source claims, "The situation changed abruptly in the second half of the year for various reasons." It adds that Samsung's LSI and Foundry Divisions encountered severe problems with the chip, which reportedly "ruined" it.</p><p>At the time moment, the "production plan" for the Exynos 2500 is still uncertain, according to its source. This has supposedly provoked Samsung into delaying the release of the Galaxy Z Flip FE "several months after" its expected launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">flagship Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The post claims the Exynos 2500 was also looked at as a contender for the flagship Flip 7, but that might not happen. Instead, Samsung may have to lean on Qualcomm for its next clamshell.</p>

<p>We've heard rumors about an Exynos 2500 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2500-soc-specs-leak">since early last year</a>. Reports suggested Samsung was looking to kick its performance up a notch with a 10-core structure continuation. However, the upgrades could arrive via a single Cortex X-5 CPU with speeds that could vary between 3.2 and 3.3GHz. Rumors also stated the chip could feature three Cortex-A730 cores, clocking inn anywhere from 2.3 to 2.5GHz.</p><p>The chip is supposedly going to be built off Samsung's 3nm process alongside AMD's RDNA-based Xclipse 950 GPU. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025">analysts continue to speculate</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip FE's existence, stating it is on deck for 2025 — though this Exynos rumor might've pushed it back in the year.</p><p>The Bell's report states that while Samsung is allegedly struggling with its Exynos 2500, the company is still pushing ahead with the 2600 SoC. We heard something similar earlier this month with one report claiming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">Samsung is "urgent"</a> about producing the Exynos 2600. The Korean OEM is rumored to have created a task force to oversee its production and performance as it looks to not slip back any further behind the competition.</p><p>Another report eight days later claimed Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-next-gen-4nm-process-chip-production-reported">started mass producing</a> the chip. It'll be a while before we see the Exynos 2600 as it's suspected to debut in the Galaxy S26 series.</p>

Not an AI-enhanced or AI-infused motion capture of the actress, but a fully AI-generated clip said to be part of a prototype stage experiment by the studio.</p><p>The clip was quickly removed for copyright violation so I can't share it with you, but it showed the character conversing with the player using voice prompts and is in no way anything that's ready for use. The narrator makes this very clear and says it's simply a prototype to demo the new tech to Sony execs.</p><p>I'll freely admit it took me a bit to understand why I cared to give it more than a passing glance.</p>

<p>I didn't think much of it until I saw that Ashly Burch, the actor who plays Aloy in the blockbuster game, took to Instagram and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ashly.burch/video/7481742753991314734?is_from_webapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id=7478426929085531694" target="_blank">TikTok</a> to talk about it all. She makes some very good points about how this type of technology will affect the future of game development, especially since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/interactive-media-video-game-strike" target="_blank">SAG is on strike</a> over the use of AI in the video game industry right now.</p><p>If any of that seems interesting to you, you should definitely check out what Burch has to say.</p>

<p>Everyone has a moment when they realize what's been bothering them, that thing they haven't been able to put a finger on. I play PC games, so this is sort of my moment.</p><p>You may love it or loathe it, but a large part of a AAA mega-million-dollar video game is storytelling. AI can't tell a story unless a person tells it what to say. AI has no experience to draw from. It has no original thoughts or ideas. It can't like or dislike something, so it can't convey that message to us. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/can-googles-lamda-chatbot-actually-be-sentient">AI is a stupid robot programmed to say smart things by smart people</a>. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Burch's fears that this will negatively affect the game industry are valid for the actors and writers who work hard to create the things we love. I'm not one of them. I'm just a person who buys and plays said games. I have my own thoughts from that perspective.</p><p>AI is here and it's not going away. Consumer-facing gimmicks will soon wear thin and be less in our faces, but the technology is here to stay. AI will be able to take your job even though it will never be very good at doing it. AI can write code but it can't write good, original code. AI can write articles like this one, but it will never have an opinion. AI can never replace the human factor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RkZAbAca5q4HDicpjxqLk" name="Google-Assistant-sentience.jpg" alt="Hey Google, are you human?" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RkZAbAca5q4HDicpjxqLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes, we want that human factor. I'm more about the action when I play a game than the story, but I want to hear from actors who can put feelings into their work, not from a robot. I think never is a strong word, but I can't see AI doing that unless someone invents something impossible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">AI will be there to help you with your battery life </a>or try to find what you're searching for, and it will do a great job. Eventually. It has a long way to go before it can tell me how it feels.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android 15 is the latest flavor of Google's smartphone operating system, and like most software, it's constantly evolving and changing based on user feedback. The most recent feature drop brought some new features to Pixel phones and watches, one of them being Modes. Google now lets you create custom modes on a Pixel phone and access it through a dedicated menu from the quick settings screen.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> adds a new quick toggle option called "Modes," which groups Do Not Disturb, Bedtime, and Driving toggles under a single menu. If you have a Pixel phone, here's how you can access it and use it. The following steps were tested on a Pixel 6a running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, but it should be the same for any other Pixel too running the latest Android build.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-access-and-set-up-modes-2">How to access and set up Modes</h2>
<p>1. Perform a swipe-down gesture anywhere on the home screen or from the top edge of the screen till you see the quick settings buttons. You should see <strong>Modes</strong> as the fourth option.</p><p>2. Tap it once to access the pop-out menu. Here, you'll have the three default modes of <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>, <strong>Bedtime</strong>, and <strong>Driving</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap any one of these modes to activate it. You can have multiple modes active at the same time.</p><p>4. In order to customize any mode, simply long press them, and you'll be taken to the customization menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="JZzCpkZWPVzbdYER4ZdNLS" name="pixel-modes-how-to-set-up-1" alt="Screenshots showing Pixel Modes menu and customization of default profiles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZzCpkZWPVzbdYER4ZdNLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-create-a-custom-mode-2">How to create a custom Mode</h2>
<p>1. Follow the first step from above to get to the <strong>Modes</strong> menu via quick settings.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Settings</strong> in the bottom left corner.</p><p>3. Tap the last option which says <strong>Create your own mode</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Custom</strong> to create a mode from scratch. You can also enable <strong>Flip to shhh </strong>from here, which automatically puts your phone in DnD when you flip it face-down on a table. DnD is disabled the next time you pick it up.</p><p>4. If you chose Custom, you can now choose a symbol for your custom mode that best describes the activity. For this example, I've chosen a ticket stub since I've created a profile for when I'm at the cinema.</p><p>5. You can give a custom name to your profile, like Movies, in this case. Tap <strong>Done</strong> when finished.</p><p>6. Next, you'll be taken to a customization page similar to the default profiles. You can set it to turn on automatically based on a specific date and time or based on calendar events.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>There's no way to revert your choice when choosing to activate a mode automatically based on calendar events or date and time, which is a strange limitation. Your only option is to delete the profile and start over.</p>

<p>7. You can also choose which contacts are allowed to interrupt your mode. Starred contacts are added here by default. Other interruptions from apps, reminders, alarms, etc., can also be controlled.</p><p>8. Finally, the <strong>Display settings</strong> option lets you choose what happens to the display when the mode is active, like dimming the wallpaper, enable grayscale, and so on.</p>

<p>Pixels make up some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and Google is trying to enhance the user experience with Modes. Now that you have the ability to create tens of custom Modes, having quick access through a dedicated menu makes a lot of sense.</p><p>However, in doing so, we've lost the ability to directly enable Do Not Disturb or Bedtime with a single tap. It's now an extra step to toggle these modes on or off, which has irked many Pixel users, as this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j4cjiu/modes_in_new_pixel_8_update/">Reddit thread</a> shows.</p><p>Of all the modes, I think Do Not Disturb is one that many of us use the most, and if you don't have a dedicated button to enable it, like on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, this additional step can be annoying. I personally never manually toggle Bedtime mode as it automatically engages at night, and it's the same with Driving mode, which kicks in every time Android Auto starts up.</p><p>For people who love having custom profiles set up for different activities, the new Modes shortcut menu is a blessing. We just wish Google would give us the option to keep Do Not Disturb as a standalone shortcut button, but perhaps future iterations will improve on this feature.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next generation of PebbleOS smartwatches is finally here as two new devices greet users today (Mar. 18).</p><p>Pebble's original founder, Eric Migicovsky, published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches">a new blog post</a> to announce the arrival of what users have been waiting for: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2 smartwatches. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, Core Devices, as it looks to lead the way into the next generation of PebbleOS-ready wearables. Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with "thousands of your beloved Pebble apps."</p><p>Leading the launch today is the Time 2 with a 1.5-inch e-paper display (also a touch screen). The post states this should give consumers "more room" for viewing text and other details on their wrists. Covering this soft display will be a piece of flat glass, which Core Devices states will deliver "less glare and reflections" than its older watches.</p><p>Surrounding this e-paper display will be a metal frame outfitted with physical buttons.</p><p>Overall, Core Devices says the Time 2 is slightly bigger to accommodate its 53% larger display with 88% more pixels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RGF2pic7x6nBKXEenyJqLH" name="core-devices-pebbleos-time-2-black" alt="The Time 2 smartwatch by Core Devices in black with a color e-paper display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGF2pic7x6nBKXEenyJqLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1282" height="721" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The blog post claims the Time 2 will have an incredible 30-day battery life. The details state this is "estimated," so it's not presently clear if the watch will reach this number or not. The specs also do not make the battery capacity of the Time 2 either.</p><p>Underneath it all, the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices has provided the watch with water resistance at an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker.</p><p>The announcement post teases a bit of its software, stating the Time 2 can run over 10,000 Pebble apps and watch faces. with PebbleOS. Users will have access to "notifications, timeline, watch faces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking," and more. Aesthetically, the Time 2 will feature a 22mm strap and will be available in black and white; however, Core Devices states there will be a third color option finalized at a later date.</p><p>The Time 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">available for pre-orders today</a> (Mar. 18) for $225 ahead of its shipping date in December. Migicovsky states pre-ordering is the only way to receive this device as it will not be sold in stores. Quantities are limited, so keep this in mind if you're interested so you can act accordingly.</p>

<p>The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, a watch that Migicovsky claims is pretty identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. On the surface, the Core 2 Duo features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display. Encasing it will be a lightweight polycarbonate frame with a trio of physical buttons. Like the Time 2, Core Devices states it is "targeting" an IPX8 water-resistant rating.</p><p>A microphone, step, and sleep-tracking capabilities continue to remain on the Core 2 Duo like the older Pebble 2.</p><p>The upgrades Core Devices alluded to include a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.</p><p>As you'd expect, the Core 2 Duo rocks the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">open-source PebbleOS</a> like its larger partner. This gives users looking to purchase this device access to a slew of similar features, as well as 10,000 Pebble apps and watch faces.</p><p>The Core 2 Duo is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">for pre-order</a> today, too, in white and black for $149. This watch will ship much earlier in July for consumers. The company urges speed again from consumers interested in this device due to its limited quantities like the Time 2. The post states this is due to a "limited supply of display inventory."</p>

But there’s no denying that there are times when they can come in too fast and too furious and be pretty distracting. This might be when you’re in a meeting, and a personal group conversation is blowing up, or when you turn your phone back on after having it in Airplane Mode for a long flight, and your phone goes mad, alerting you to everything you missed.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-notification-cooldown">Notification Cooldown</a> is a new feature available with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 Android 15 update</a>. It’s designed to help you manage an influx of notifications, minimizing sound interruptions and on-screen pop-ups. It’s easy to set up in just a few clicks.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-notification-cooldown-on-a-google-pixel-work-2">How does Notification Cooldown on a Google Pixel work?</h2>
<p>Notifications Cooldown works by counting how many notifications you get within a short period. If that exceeds a certain threshold, the phone’s volume will lower, and the alerts will be minimized for up to two minutes. You can’t change the threshold, but you can leave it in Google’s capable hands to determine what’s too much.</p><p>While Notification Cooldown can temporarily shush the notifications you don’t really need right away on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, including those from both Google Pixel and other brands, there are some exceptions. It will not silence calls, alarms, priority conversations, and emergency alerts. That’s a good thing, of course, allowing you to quiet things like social media likes and comments and unimportant daily reminders while ensuring you don’t miss crucial happenings or details about your day.</p><p>It's a great way to still be notified of what’s important without having to turn your phone on silent to avoid an unexpected barrage of messages or other notifications that don’t require your immediate attention.</p><p>Notification Cooldown was made available to Pixel phones as a quarterly release with Android 15 and will continue to be a core part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings">Android 16</a> once it is released in Q2 2025. For now, as long as your Pixel device is updated to the latest version of Android 15, you’ll see the option in the menu and be able to enjoy its benefits.</p><p>Once set up, friends, family members, and co-workers won’t think you’re a secret spy getting intelligence on the fly when it’s really just ongoing team chatter about snacks for the weekend game or your recent X post getting a ton of attention.</p>

<hr>
<p>Circular announces a couple of new features for its smart ring that could help users better understand their health.</p><p>According to a press release, Circular states it is preparing to bring two features to its Ring 2: Blood Pressure and Glucose monitoring. The company says both features will arrive to assist users in a "non-invasive" way to provide "deeper insight into your health." To get this done, the post states the Blood Pressure (BP) update will arrive this year through an OTA (over the air) update for the Ring 2.</p><p>However, Circular claims it's stepping up its ring's accuracy by combining ECG and PPG technology. In theory, this is said to "enable spot blood pressure measurements," which Circular states will make its Ring 2 the "first smart ring to achieve this."</p><p>Additionally, Circular says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">the Ring 2</a> will receive PTT (Pulse Transit Time), detailing how long it takes blood to travel through your arteries. The company says its "quick measurements" can take anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes, but are designed to offer you an insightful glimpse into the state of your blood pressure.</p><p>Circular announces its consumers can expect its Blood Pressure update in "late 2025."</p>
<h2 id="the-ring-2-s-blood-glucose-monitoring-2">The Ring 2's Blood Glucose Monitoring</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi" name="Circular-Ring-2-press-photo-rose-gold" alt="A press photo of the rose gold Circular Ring 2 sitting on a rose petal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second major update is the statement that the Circular Ring 2 is preparing to debut a Blood Glucose monitoring update in "late 2026."</p><p>The post claims this update will be "truly groundbreaking," allowing its users to track how their glucose levels fluctuate "without finger-pricks or CGMs." The Ring 2 is said to utilize PPG sensors and Circular's machine-learning software to analyze how light interacts with a person's blood. The Ring 2 will soon activate "consistent readings" — which could take up to two minutes to complete after waking up — to determine your "long-term glucose patterns."</p><p>Circular appears confident that while its glucose monitoring won't replace more traditional monitoring methods, its technology will at least be "valuable." It remains to be seen just how well the Ring 2 will be at understanding and compiling the information needed for <em>accurate </em>glucose trend monitoring.</p><p>Nevertheless, we'll see how things fair late next year.</p><p>An announcement like this precedes the likes of Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">which was teased</a> to have glucose monitoring in the works for a future Galaxy Watch. A Samsung exec, senior vice president Hon Pak, brought awareness to the company's development of non-invasive glucose monitoring. Pak stated the feature would be "optical-based," meaning users won't have to fret about needles.</p><p>Similar to what Circular has said, Samsung's Hon Pak states glucose monitoring will be a "game-changer;" however, that'll only be the case if they "do it right."</p>

<ul><li>Google announced two new features for Gemini that will help users create documents as well as codes within the application.</li><li>Gemini's Canvas allows people to create essays and collaborate with others by exporting their work directly on to Google Docs.</li><li>Canvas also allows users to bring their codes to life, cutting the time taking process of creating codes.</li><li>Gemini is introducing something called Audio Overviews that makes life easier by transforming a boring lengthy document into a fun podcast.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been on a roll lately, announcing changes to its Google Assistant and bolstering more of Gemini in every nook and cranny they find that AI could be used.</p><p>Recently they announced<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced"> several updates to the Gemini app</a>, and expanded Flash 2.0 to many more people. Today (Mar. 18) it has announced two more tools to help users collaborate better with the AI assistant.</p><p>Google detailed in a press release that it is bringing a new interactive space to house your documents, called "Canvas.” This tool will help users collaborate with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, while they write essays, blog posts, research papers, and so on. Canvas lets you "create, draft, edit, and refine docs or code in a single space," but with the power of Gemini. Imagine Gemini to be your invisible sidekick during your assignments, giving you suggestions and edits as and when necessary.</p><p>Canvas can also adjust the tone of your document or even give you suggestions based on the topic in concern, to make the essay or blog post read better. For example, highlight a paragraph and ask Gemini to make it more concise, professional, or informal. This works best when you're drafting an important speech for a presentation, or a creative report. Canvas will fine-tune and personalize the suggestions based on the user's needs.</p><p>While editing on Canvas, the changes are said to show up in real-time. All users have to do is select ‘Canvas’ in Gemini's prompt bar and you can begin writing. Additionally, it allows you to share your work with people who'd like to contribute to the report or blog post— by exporting it to Google Docs, from Gemini itself.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-your-codes-to-life-2">Bringing your codes to life</h2>
<p>Documents aren't the only thing that can be created on Canvas, according to the tech giant, you can also get thinking like a software developer or programmer. The tool allows users to bring their codes to life by creating an actual "working prototype"—by simplifying the technical process of coding, so users can focus on the creative aspect of the code. This happens within Canvas, without needing to switch between multiple applications, making it more seamless.</p><p>"Within Canvas, you can generate and preview your HTML/React code and other web app prototypes to see a visual representation of your design," the press release added.</p><p>For example, creating email subscriptions for your website becomes much quicker,  "you can ask Gemini to generate the HTML for the form and then preview how it will appear and function within your web app." All the user needs to fill in the input fields or add call-to-action buttons. Canvas will also give you a quick preview of what your code will look like instantly.</p>

<p>Audio Overviews is a feature that was previously only on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">NotebookLM,</a> and now Google is bringing it to Gemini after several users were keen on testing it out.</p><p>As the name suggests this feature is said to transform boring, lengthy documents into podcasts that are not just easy to understand but are also interactive and engaging. Imagine not being able to understand a complex topic in class and you're given a PDF with a ton of jargon. That's where Audio Overviews comes in.</p><p>"Gemini will create a podcast-style discussion between two AI hosts who, with just a click, launch into a lively deep-dive conversation based on your uploaded document."</p><p>It won't just tell you what's in the document but will also give you different perspectives on the topic within the document, helping the user understand complex information better and quicker.</p><p>This feature works with all kinds of documents including research papers, lengthy email threads, or reports generated by Deep Research.</p><p>To create an Audio Overview, all you have to do is upload documents or slides and click the <em>suggestion chip</em> that pops up above the prompt bar. Once the podcast is created, it can also be downloaded onto your device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Can we just say, better late than never?</p><p>The much-anticipated One UI 7 update of Galaxy devices finally has a launch date. Samsung has announced that the official rollout will begin on April 7.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-7">announcement post</a>, the first set of devices to experience the latest operating system includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>The company further notes that other eligible devices comprising Galaxy S24 FE, Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy S23 FE, and the older Galaxy foldables like Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 will be receiving the update gradually in the coming weeks. There are also tablets, which will be receiving the update like the Galaxy Tab S9 and the more recent Galaxy Tab S0 series.</p>

<p>Samsung started rolling out the One UI 7 for devices like the Galaxy S24 series in beta last year. The devices have already received a couple of betas over the past few months. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series, however, has been the first set of devices to come with stable Android 15-based One UI 7 out of the box as they launched in January.</p><p>Meanwhile, the predecessor models were expected to be getting the official builds around the same time; it appears Samsung has taken its sweet time to roll out the official builds a couple of months later. Also, this is a first from Samsung — a delayed OS roll-out compared to the previous One UI versions.</p>

<p>Regardless, it is encouraging to see the launch date of One UI 7 despite the delays as the betas have showcased some of the interesting features the operating system is bringing to the Galaxy phones — and it is considered the most notable update compared to last year’s version. The first set of changes that Galaxy users can expect with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> include a simplified Home Screen, redesigned One UI widgets, and a Lock Screen, which additionally provides customizations.</p><p>This new OS will bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, which is powered by Galaxy AI sits on the lock screen, and supports real-time updates for apps like Timers, Google Maps, and Spotify, for example. Other notable AI features comprise AI Select, Writing Assist, Drawing Assist, and Audio Eraser. Google’s Gemini integration is also expected to be another notable improvement with the One UI 7 update.</p>

<hr>
<p>Roku users have started noticing a new and pretty intrusive ad tactic popping up over the past few days, and, as you’d expect, people aren’t happy about it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a> reports that some Roku users are now getting hit with ads before the home screen even shows up. While Roku is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-ceo-video-ads-home-screen-confirmed">no stranger to sprinkling ads around the home screen</a>, this new move takes it up a notch, forcing folks to sit through video ads just to get to their usual setup.</p><p>Roku confirmed to Ars Technica that these autoplay ads are part of an official test. However, the company remains tight-lipped on how many devices are affected, why it is rolling this out, or whether it’s here to stay for good.</p><p>Instead of admitting it might’ve gone too far, Roku said it's all about constant experimentation and innovation, whether it’s tweaking the interface, expanding content, or revamping its ad strategy.</p>
<h2 id="skippable-or-not-depends-who-you-ask-2">Skippable or not? Depends who you ask</h2>
<p>Early reports suggested these ads couldn’t be skipped, but Roku told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/roku-tests-unskippable-home-screen-video-ads-before-you-can-use-your-roku/" target="_blank">Cord Cutter News</a> that there is a way to close them. However, Ars Technica has shared user experiences where that option seemed to be missing. So, it’s a bit of a mixed bag.</p><p>The move to force autoplaying video ads before users can even get to the home screen has, unsurprisingly, sparked a wave of frustration. Frustrated users are venting on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1jcuibl/question_about_ads/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, with some saying they were stuck watching promos—like the Moana 2 trailer—before they could open their apps.</p><p>Roku started shifting away from static home screen ads <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/roku-will-be-adding-new-video-ads-to-its-home-screen/" target="_blank">in early 2024</a>, cranking up the ad pressure on users. But it's not alone; other platforms are doing the same. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, for example, recently rolled out ads that literally advertise more ads, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-is-showing-ads-for-ads-this-week/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>.</p><p>No matter the brand, a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming platforms</a> are constantly testing how much advertising users will put up with, especially when it comes to cheap streaming devices.</p>

I did have some formal education in the field as an undergrad in college. For instance, did you know that the part of the brain responsible for impulse control isn’t fully developed until around the age of 25? The folks who make apps know this, along with many other insights they use to help keep you addicted to using your favorite app.</p><p>With that knowledge, developers implement design features that keep you constantly checking or stuck in a "time suck" on their apps contributing to the lack of focus many people experience today. While it's not always wise to rely on the cause of a problem for the solution, Neurable's brain-computer interface might be an exception.</p>

<p>There are various solutions that manufacturers themselves have implemented, built into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-tell-you-just-how-long-youve-been-scrolling-with-new-screen-time-reminders" target="_blank">mobile OS under their "Screen Time"</a> or "Digital Wellbeing" menus. You may even have access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-priority-mode-qpr1-detailed" target="_blank">"Focus Modes" </a>that allow you to turn apps and their notifications off to minimize distractions. While that’s great, I’ve often found that you must replace a thing you’re removing from your life with a healthy alternative for that change to be long-term.</p><p>Then there's the Neurable approach, which relies on gamification and technology to <em><strong>undo</strong></em> the problems they have created while also helping you train your attention span.</p><p>This could be that rare exception of the problem also being the solution.

<p>In 2017, neurotech startup Neurable unveiled the world's first brain-controlled VR game at the SIGGRAPH conference in partnership with VR graphics company estudiofuture.</p><p>That year, they had their gear pared down and paired with an HTC Vive, but it's taken almost ten years of iterating to go from the Neurable Electrode Reduction headgear in the image below (right) to the HTC Vive model to their current retail offering, the MW75 Neuro wireless ANC headphones (pictured below, left).</p>

<p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw75-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones">purchase the standard Master & Dynamic MW75</a> for $599 on the Master & Dynamic for just website. However, the partnership with Neurable adds $100 to that price, meaning you pay $699 for the MW75 Neuro, which you can purchase from both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neurable.com/products?variant=45976725881078#buy-box">Neurable website</a> and from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw75-neuro">Master & Dynamic</a>, although the latter has fewer color options. We'll get into what that price gets you as we talk more about this brain interface computer.

<h2 id="the-hardware-2">The hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="sjAKV42pqf4sDaBi7GTtGA" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-headphones-in-case.JPG" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro, showing everything that comes in the hard case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sjAKV42pqf4sDaBi7GTtGA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MW75 was already an excellent piece of hardware. It's an audiophile-grade pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> that you can also use wired. At that price point, you get elevated physical details, which include easily replaceable earpads, leather, a sturdy build that makes the headphones feel a bit heavy, and mechanical buttons that have a reassuring tactile click.</p><p>Sonically, you get a balanced sound that doesn't sacrifice bass response or clarity to deliver an entertaining and illuminating experience. The bass isn't ultra-dark but gives you enough rumble to keep things fun.</p><p>The highs and mids aren't fatiguing, but the soundstage and instrument separation are expansive and teeter toward analytical when paired with the right wired mobile DAC/amp. My only issue with them is their earcup size.</p><p>I have to make sure they're over my ears because they're a bit of a tight fit for me, and if I don't place them very intentionally, they tend to sit on my ears a bit instead of against my skull, just around my ears.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RA7HrWF99NqXMNWqYbXX8" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-on-head" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RA7HrWF99NqXMNWqYbXX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other features are solid, too. The ANC is very strong. Using physical buttons so that you rarely need to touch your phone is well thought out. And the microphones that allow you to take calls are clear and crisp and don't make you sound like you're in a closet.</p><p>The only downside is that the noisier my environment got, the harder callers said it was to hear me, so there was no background noise cancellation.</p><p>Aside from that, the MW75 Neuro also comes with all the accessories you'll need in the beautifully appointed hard case. Inside that case, you'll find a USB-C charge cable that supports audio pass-thru, a 3.5m aux cable, a 1/4" adapter, and a USB-A adapter if you're using a device or older computer that doesn't have USB-C ports.</p><p>All of that before we even talk about the 12 channels of EEG through the EEG sensors embedded in the modified earpads. Master & Dynamics' OEM MW75 comes with leather earpads, but Neurable went with swappable fabric earpads to accommodate the sensors.</p>

<p>At the heart of this is Neurable AI, the brainchild of Neurable CEO and co-founder Dr. Ramses Alcaide and his team. In very simple terms, they use algorithms to turn your brainwave data into actionable insights so that you can retrain yourself to focus better on tasks.</p><p>You get all that info in the Neurable app, which is available for iOS and Android. I've used both for over two months and have been quite impressed with the experience.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Neurable AI and the app is to help you achieve better sustained focus when needed. But first, “focus” must be defined. Neurable uses the definition from one of the leading experts in the field, Dr. Gloria Mark:</p><p>"Focus represents a temporal state when people feel absorbed in an activity, and the activity generally requires some degree of challenge to a person’s skill set. Being highly engaged and challenged in work is correlated with motivation, activation, concentration, creativity, and satisfaction."</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Pro tip</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">This is also a fun party trick. In real-time, you'll see how your brain activity influences the rocket.</p></div></div>
<p>After you've created an account, paired the MW75 Neuro, and gone through the tutorial, your introduction to Neurable focus will be a novel rocket game. Start the game, and you'll see a rocket ship on screen. The better you focus on it, the faster it will fly through the air.</p><p>The Neurable app has three tabs at the bottom of the page: Home, Sessions, My Focus, and Settings. Home is where you'll see messages on improving your focus, stats from your last focus session, and insights the AI has compiled based on your session history. You'll also start a focus session from the Home tab.</p><p>The Sessions tab is where you'll see a running log of your previous sessions, which you can click on. Then, you can see the Session Summary for each logged entry. The My Focus tab is where you'll see the bar graphs of your cumulative focus scores and time spent in various focus levels by day and week.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I'm very competitive, so the placebo effect was initially in full effect. Knowing my focus was being monitored was enough to get me to finally set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-zen-mode-motorola-unplugged-samsung-relax">focus mode on my Android phone</a> to keep the many pings and tings at bay while I give whatever task the attention it deserves. That was great for the first couple of sessions, but after that, the old habit came back, and the real trials with Neurable began.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review" target="_blank">I wrote reviews</a>, balanced my finances, and did research, all while either listening to Lo-fi hip-hop to aid in focus (something I'd been doing for some time prior to my Neurable test) or no music at all. It appeared the app accurately tracked my focus as I got work done or was distracted.</p><p>During two of my longest sessions, an hour and a half and two and a half hours, it was easy to see when FOMO and phone checking interrupted my attention span. On the other hand, it was also very easy to see when I was locked in, and the writing flowed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rYttCMpj5MuKsZM4FKnKuX" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-app-composite" alt="Neurable app composite image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYttCMpj5MuKsZM4FKnKuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The insights I've gleaned from the app and Neurable AI are that I tend to focus best in the afternoon and when I've chosen "Other" as my activity when beginning a focus session. My longest attention span was about an hour long, and my most extended focus session was two and a half hours. I definitely felt locked in and more productive.</p><p>I've come to look at Neurable like I do my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> and its notifications: it's a good nag. It's placing my lack of focus right in my face so that I address it right there, at the moment. The difference is that this isn't any sort of alert to stand up because I've been sitting too long or a low fitness warning, but instead, the entire exercise of having sessions of focus is my alert. My "warning."</p><p>That said, there is a "stand alert" of sorts in the app. When in a Focus Session, you'll be alerted when your focus has been low for too long or when you've been working too long, and your focus is beginning to suffer. At that time, you'll be prompted to take a "brain break."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Neurable is great at "nagging" me when it detects my focus is low, prompting me to take a "break break" from time to time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The point of that is to relax for a moment so you can come back to your work, refocused and productive, and it absolutely works for me. When I took brain breaks, I could see that the graph was back at high focus afterward but was more scattered in the level of attention shown if I didn't take any breaks.</p><p>Being intentional about a goal generally brings with it measurable results. Ultimately, what the MW75 and Neurable AI do is help you cultivate focus.</p><p>Eventually, you won't need Neurable because it will help train you to increase your attention span and give sustained periods of singular focus to those tasks that require it.</p><p>That's the difference between what Neurable AI and screen time or digital well-being in an OS provides. The latter only tells you when you've spent too much time in distraction land, which is also a good thing, but it's the ability of the former to retrain the amount of attention you give to those distractions and the quality of your focus time spent on those tasks you've identified as priorities in your life.</p>
<h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KYWp5peAAddgVAAMftiXQA" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-earcup-branding.JPG" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro showing the EEG contacts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KYWp5peAAddgVAAMftiXQA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MW75 Neuro and Neurable AI are fantastic technological achievements that could be beneficial to a lot of people. Those who deal with various forms of ADHD and any other issues that keep them from achieving the level of focus they’d like to give to their tasks will benefit from tech like this.</p><p>Just like medical journals have found fitness trackers and smartwatches do help users increase their physical health by encouraging them to simply take 10k steps, the focus Neurable helps you put on your focus should net positive results.</p><p>The primary issue here is how new the tech is and how costly it is. At $700, this tech is inaccessible for many. Especially in the current economic climate and social instability that many may find themselves in.</p><p>Two things need to happen here: Neurable works with insurers to have this tech be FSA approved, and producing the EEG tech becomes cheaper so that Neurable’s next product is in the $200 price range.</p><p>On the latter point, I would love to see a partnership with a company like Soundcore, JBL, or 1More, as this would be an easy way to bring its brain wave tracking technology to more people. Fortunately, Neurable assures me that better access is one of its goals, and this is just the beginning.</p>

With the iPhone 16e, Apple is looking to update that formula; the phone has a bigger profile and includes Face ID as standard, and it gets USB-C connectivity. There's a bigger battery than the one in the iPhone 16, and as it is powered by the same A18 platform, it comes with all the Apple Intelligence features. <br><br>All of these upgrades come at a cost, with the iPhone 16e starting at $599. That puts it uncomfortably close to last year's iPhone 15, and while it does a great job with the fundamentals, it misses out on extras: you don't get a secondary camera at the back, there's no MagSafe, and the panel is still 60Hz. <br><br>But if you're on an older iPhone and looking to upgrade, there are enough new features on the iPhone 16e that make it a decent choice — if you don't mind the high asking price.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled the iPhone 16e on February 19, 2025, and the device went on sale globally starting February 28. It starts at $599 in the U.S., £599 ($775) in the U.K. and €699 ($761) in other countries in the region, and ₹59,990 ($690) in India. The standard model comes with 128GB of storage, and you also get 256GB and 512GB variants. The iPhone 16e is available in white and black options, and this is what the device costs around the world:</p>
<ul><li>iPhone 16e (128GB): $599 / £599 / €699 / ₹59,990</li><li>iPhone 16e (256GB): $699 / £699 / €829 / ₹69,990</li><li>iPhone 16e (512GB): $899 / £899 / €1,029 / ₹89,990</li></ul>

<p>The iPhone 16e uses the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 as the foundation for the design, and the device has the exact same dimensions. It isn't quite as small as the iPhone SE 2022, and that's ultimately a good thing — that 4.7-inch size was getting too small anyway. The iPhone 16e has a good in-hand feel, and even though it has a bigger battery than the iPhone 13, it is a smidgen lighter, and that's always a good thing.</p>

<p>The positioning of the power and volume buttons is unchanged, and what I like is that the Action button from the iPhone 15 is available on the device. The button is just as customizable, and you can use it as a flashlight toggle, switching to silent mode, changing Focus modes, dictating notes, launching the camera, real-time translations, or a custom control.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cr9HJgSyMBtHZ4q3YCj43e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cr9HJgSyMBtHZ4q3YCj43e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I find the Action button to be the easiest way to toggle Focus modes, and I'm glad the feature is available on this device. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> feature that trickled down to the device is the USB-C port; the iPhone 16e marks the end of the Lightning port, with all of the devices in Apple's portfolio now coming with USB-C. This is a positive move, and makes charging the 16e significantly easier.</p>

<p>The one feature that didn't make its way over is the notch; the iPhone 16e uses the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/iphone-13-review">iPhone 13</a>-style cutout and not the Dynamic Island that debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and subsequent models. The older notch is distracting, and doesn't quite blend into the background as well as Dynamic Island. I find myself using the feature to easily control music playback on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, and not being able to do that here was irksome.</p>

<p>Another issue is with the choice of colors. The iPhone 16e is available in just white and black color options, and it misses out on the red variant that looked gorgeous on the SE 2022. Obviously, you can deck the device out in colorful cases, but as someone who doesn't use cases, I wanted a color option that stood out a bit more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdHidmdjPdt2dqi5d5qw4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdHidmdjPdt2dqi5d5qw4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the build quality itself is terrific (as you'd imagine), with the phone getting an aluminum mid-frame sandwiched between two panes of glass. The back has a frosted glass finish that feels great, and as an added bonus, it doesn't pick up smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MiaW6V9vfHRVSBmp8rR86e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MiaW6V9vfHRVSBmp8rR86e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a single camera at the back, and the lens doesn't call out much attention to itself — in what is a stark contrast to the massive camera lenses that are a mainstay on all Android phones. The mid-frame has a matte texture that makes holding the phone just that bit easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AJpR3ZTHGWxpUaQ6nPPu5e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJpR3ZTHGWxpUaQ6nPPu5e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a SIM card slot in global models of the device (just like the iPhone 16), but the U.S. version is limited to eSIM connectivity, but you can use two eSIMs at the same time. Another standard feature is IP68 ingress protection, with the device getting the ability to withstand submersion in up to six meters of water. <br><br>Although the design of the iPhone 16e is familiar, it has enough differentiated features from newer models that it stands out from the regular iPhone 13 and 14.</p>

<p>You get the same 6.1-inch OLED panel as the iPhone 13 and 14, and like those devices (and the iPhone 16), it is limited to 60Hz. It's annoying that 120Hz is still limited to the iPhone Pro models, particularly considering that budget Android phones also come with 120Hz as standard these days. It is a limitation on the iPhone 16e, and you can easily feel the difference when using it next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or any Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RNcvEBCB9v7VSUJpKsvU3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNcvEBCB9v7VSUJpKsvU3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel is protected by Ceramic Shield, and it holds up to tumbles incredibly well. My 21-month-old daughter decided to throw the phone around the moment I unboxed it (she likes doing that), and it came away unscathed. You get True Tone and Dolby Vision alongside HDR10, and it has good brightness levels; while it isn't on par with the iPhone 16 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9</a>, the 16e does a good job in this regard, and I didn't see any problems viewing the panel under harsh sunlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are detailed, and contrast is excellent. In fact, the only other annoyance with the panel is that there's no always-on mode — that's again limited to the Pro models. The 6.1-inch size has been around a while now on iPhones, and going with this panel makes sense; although the notch is of an older style, it is immediately familiar. <br><br>Talking about the notch, it houses the requisite modules to enable Face ID, and it is just as fast and fluid as every other iPhone I've used when it comes to authentication. It also has the secondary speaker and camera, and they both do a good job.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-performance"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Performance</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CfwHPMAhKET8Vh6Pgcp4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CfwHPMAhKET8Vh6Pgcp4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key differentiator with the iPhone 16e is that it is powered by the same A18 platform as the regular iPhone 16 models. This gives the device a huge advantage, and although it is using a binned version of the chip that sees a quad-core GPU in lieu of the five that's standard on the other models, the rest of the features are identical. The phone also gets 8GB of RAM as standard, and again, this is higher than what's available with the iPhone 14 and 15. <br><br>The phone starts with 128GB of storage on the base model, and it can be configured with 256GB or 512GB. I'm using the 512GB edition, and it is just as fluid as the iPhone 16 in daily use. It handles demanding games with ease, delivering stable framerates without any lag. If anything, the 60Hz panel holds the device back, and it's clear that it is able to push higher framerates without taxing the internals too much.</p>

<p>There are no issues with overheating either, and overall, the phone does a fantastic job in this regard. The switch to USB-C means you can use a single cable to charge all of your devices, and while you don't get fast data transmission — it is limited to 480Mbit/sec — it is much better than using Lightning. <br><br>The iPhone 16e gets all the extras that are included on the iPhone 16, such as Emergency SOS, roadside assistance, and Find My via satellite, as well as crash detection. Interestingly, the iPhone 16e sees the debut of the C1, an in-house modem built by Apple that takes over from the Qualcomm-based solutions used in all other iPhones.</p>
<p>The modem doesn't have mmWave connectivity, but it has better efficiency figures, and this is evident while testing, with the iPhone 16e eking out better battery life than the iPhone 16. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or signal quality between the two devices, and it will be interesting to see if Apple is able to scale the tech to its entire iPhone portfolio. <br><br>Overall, the iPhone 16e is the fastest phone in its category, and if you're coming from an older device, you'll love what it can deliver.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a sizeable 3,961mAh battery, and it lasts longer than any iPhone outside of the Pro Max models. Thanks to the bigger battery and efficient A18 platform, the phone manages to last over a day with relative ease, and even with heavy use, I got to the night with over 15% left. <br><br>There's no question that the iPhone 16e has an edge over the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 when it comes to battery life, and if you need a 6.1-inch iPhone that lasts all day, this is the one to get. I also like that it charges over USB-C; this was a point of contention with the iPhone SE 2022, and I'm glad it isn't a problem with the 16e. <br><br>Like other iPhones, you don't get a charger in the box, and the charging is limited to 20W. The phone gets to the 50% mark in under 30 minutes, but it takes close to two hours to charge the battery using a standard USB PD charger, and unlike most Android phones, I left it plugged in overnight because of the lengthy charging times. <br><br>Another annoyance is that there isn't MagSafe, so if you've invested in the accessory ecosystem, you won't be able to use those with the iPhone 16e. That said, the phone goes up to 7.5W over the Qi standard, so if you have a charging mat, you can use it with the device — it just doesn't go up to 25W over MagSafe like the iPhone 16.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16e has the unwelcome distinction of being the only phone I tested in recent years to feature a single camera at the back. The phone has a 48MP camera with OIS, and while it uses in-sensor zoom to deliver the same caliber of shots at 2x, that's about as versatile as it gets. <br><br>The phone misses out on the new Photographic Styles that debuted with the iPhone 16, instead defaulting to the older system where you can pick between five choices. You still get a decent customizability in this regard, but it isn't quite what you get on the other iPhone 16 models. Similarly, there's no Cinematic mode or Action mode, but you get slow-motion video and the ability to shoot 4K60 footage. <br><br>The camera interface itself is identical to every other iPhone, with the shooting modes at the bottom, and the various toggles around the viewfinder. Thankfully, Audio Mix is intact, giving you much greater control while shooting videos, and there's Night mode when taking photos.</p>

<p>While it's not quite as good as the iPhone 16, the 16e manages to take good photos in any situation. Daylight shots have good detail rendition and colors, and the camera does a decent job in low-light, with the dedicated Night mode making a difference in this regard. <br><br>That said, the limited versatility is the biggest downside of the iPhone 16e; not having a wide-angle or telephoto lens is a big enough disadvantage that I'd suggest getting the iPhone 15 if you need auxiliary cameras. The 48MP camera does a good job at 2x as well, but go beyond that and you start to see visible noise.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16e comes with iOS 18.3 out of the box, and my unit got an update to 18.3.1 shortly after I set it up. As of writing, the iPhone 16e is the most affordable device with Apple Intelligence. Apple is pushing its AI suite as a differentiator, and while most of the features are still in beta, there's plenty of great potential. I'll be honest; I wouldn't have used anywhere as much AI features if Apple didn't showcase them at an event in Mumbai, India shortly after the debut of the iPhone 16e.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZXBEoUaJnpr5PmYY3ZvR4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXBEoUaJnpr5PmYY3ZvR4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm ambivalent toward generative AI in general, but I'll admit that the iPhone 16e has one of the strongest AI-assisted feature-set of any device today. Visual Intelligence is Apple's answer to Google Lens, and it does a good job identifying locations, objects, and just about anything you look up. It is easy to use — it can be launched via the Action button, lock screen, or Control Center — and gives you decent information of the world around you.</p>

<p>In a similar vein, Writing Tools assist with proofreading and summarizing text, and you can use the built-in features to rewrite existing text. There's also the option to create unique images with text prompts via Image Playground, and custom emoji with Genmoji. You get the usual image-editing tools as well, and even if you don't use most of these features, it's clear that this is what Apple believes will make its products stand out.</p>

<p>Outside of the AI features, there isn't much new with iOS 18. The visuals have a slight refresh, but the UI as a whole should be immediately recognizable if you're coming from an older iPhone. There's a Control Center that houses all the usual toggles, and it is paginated now, giving you better access to customize media and any other controls. Focus mode is great to cut out distractions, and you get the usual privacy tools baked in.</p>

<p>The software is designed to be familiar while offering new tools. And as is the case with all iPhones, the iPhone 16e will pick up five iOS updates. Unlike most Android phones, there's no waiting to get the update (looking at you, Samsung); all iPhones can download the latest iOS version as soon as it is available.</p>

<p>The iPhone 15 is the closest alternative to the 16e. It costs an additional $100, but you get a cleaner design with Dynamic Island, two cameras at the back, and MagSafe charging. However, the device doesn't last as long as the iPhone 16e, and you miss out on all the AI features. <br><br>Over on Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is my recommendation. It has a good design, vibrant AMOLED with 120Hz, two terrific cameras at the back, a massive battery with 80W charging, and a good overall value. Google's Pixel 9a should also be a good option to consider, and if it has cameras that are anywhere as good as the 8a, it should be a standout mid-range choice.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kkeH2GCd74SdcUTSog5g6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkeH2GCd74SdcUTSog5g6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need Apple Intelligence</li><li>You want an iPhone with great battery life</li><li>You want terrific performance</li><li>You need Face ID and USB-C</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a wide-angle or tele lens</li><li>You need an iPhone with a 120Hz panel</li><li>You want MagSafe connectivity</li><li>You want a good value</li></ul>
<p>Ultimately, the iPhone 16e is a good phone, but a bad value right now. I can see this phone doing quite well if it sold at $449 or even $499, but at $599 it's hard to justify the asking price when you look at the omissions — the iPhone 15 becomes a better alternative instead. Yes, the iPhone 16e has a 48MP camera at the back, you get the A18 platform, better battery life, and it has all the AI-assisted features that you get in the iPhone 16. <br><br>However, there's just a single camera at the back, and that just isn't enough in 2025 — even entry-level phones have wide-angle lenses these days. Granted, these sensors tend to be average at best and unusable at times, but not including one at all on a $599 phone is a short-sighted move. Similarly, not including a 120Hz panel hobbles the device, and it makes it a poor bargain against Android rivals. <br><br>It's clear that the iPhone 16e is aimed at older iPhones users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware. The inclusion of the A18 and all the AI features make it a decent choice in this regard, and if I'm looking at it purely as a successor to the iPhone SE 2022, it gets a lot right: you get a much bigger screen, significantly improved battery life, much better hardware, and a great camera at the back. <br><br>As an upgrade to the iPhone SE 2022, the iPhone 16e nails the brief. If that's what you're looking for in an iPhone upgrade, then the iPhone 16e is a good choice. Otherwise, the iPhone 15 gives you more value, even if you miss out on Apple Intelligence.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Assistant’s time is ticking as Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">takes over mobile and eventually smart devices</a>, so the tech giant announced the new batch of features on the chopping block.</p><p>With Gemini set to fully take over by the end of 2025, Google is now axing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=" target="_blank">seven more Assistant features</a>, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/16/google-assistant-losing-features-2025/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This move isn’t exactly surprising, though. Google has been slowly chipping away at Assistant’s capabilities since late 2024, making it clear that the transition is well underway.</p><p>Turns out, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> transition isn’t just happening to Android phones. Google’s smart home lineup, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">premium smart speakers</a> and smart displays, is also in for some changes.</p><p>After phasing out several Assistant features, Google has now confirmed that more "underutilized features" are getting the axe as part of this transition.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-getting-cut-2">What’s getting cut?</h2>
<p>First off, Google is pulling the plug on the ability to manage photo metadata by voice. That means you won’t be able to favorite, share, or ask about the time and location of photos using voice commands anymore. However, you can still do all of this manually in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, and photo metadata will still be viewable on Smart Displays and tablets.</p><p>Similarly, voice commands for tweaking photo frame and ambient display settings are going away, but you can still adjust them directly through the Smart Display settings.</p><p>Interpreter mode, which provides real-time multilingual translation during conversations, is also getting cut. You’ll still be able to translate single words and phrases, but the live conversation feature is disappearing.</p><p>Google is also removing automatic birthday reminders in Routines, though you can still set them up manually with Assistant commands. Family Bell announcements—scheduled or requested reminders for family broadcasts—are also on the chopping block.</p><p>Additionally, Google is shutting down automatic daily updates like weather reports, but you can still set up custom Routines to get scheduled updates. Lastly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> will no longer work with car accessories connected via Bluetooth or an aux cable.</p>
<h2 id="no-clear-timeline-just-warnings-2">No clear timeline, just warnings</h2>
<p>To make things even more frustrating, Google hasn’t laid out a clear timeline for when these features will disappear. Instead, users will get notifications while using affected features, giving them a heads-up before they’re shut down.</p><p>To make up for the loss of features you've come to love, Google suggests setting up custom Routines as a workaround.</p>

For instance, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 operates as a phone, tablet, and even a computer when it’s connected to an external display. Tablets are a different beast, but most of the time, they can be turned into productivity machines with the right accessories and a bit of patience.</p><p>In order to get that laptop-like experience, I do need at least a keyboard, if not a keyboard and monitor. However, when Lenovo showed off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-hybrid-combines-android-and-windows">ThinkBook Plus Gen 5</a> earlier this year, I immediately thought that this could actually be the best way to use Android and Windows at the same time. All without needing to worry about making sure I have the right peripherals to pair with whatever foldable or tablet I’m using.</p><p>After spending a bit of time with one of Lenovo’s latest creations, I’ve come to a few realizations, some good, and some not so much.</p>

<p>Lenovo debuted the ThinkBook Plus (Gen 5) at CES 2024, before it was officially released in September 2024. There is only one configuration available, with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage. The retail price listed on Lenovo’s website comes in at $3,518, but it’s currently available for 42% off, or about $2,040.</p>

<p>Let’s get this out of the way really quickly. When everything works as advertised, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 does everything one could think of and then some. I mean, it’s a Windows laptop AND an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a>, complete with built-in software that marries the two. How much better can it really get?</p><p>On top of that, the Hybrid Tab detaches from the Hybrid Station, and you can still use both of them at the same time! Well, as long as you have a monitor to plug the Station into. It’s just an absolutely wild experience.</p><p>What’s even more wild is that I’m able to pull up the Android experience from the Tab, while also making use of Phone Link, all from Windows. With that, I’m able to have an app open from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, the entire Android tablet experience, <em>and</em> Windows, all without actually needing to pick up and use another device.</p>

<p>Of course, things get crowded pretty quickly on this 14-inch display, but you won’t be able to find another device that can offer this same experience. It’s also not something that I actually use very often, but it has come in handy when I want to test something out, but I’m too lazy to pick up my phone or don’t want to reboot into tablet mode.</p>
<p>Back when Lenovo first showcased this beast, I was a bit concerned about the actual performance. Surely, Lenovo would manage to cut costs in ways that would leave us feeling a bit frustrated. But I don’t actually think that’s the case here.</p><p>You could argue that opting for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-plus-gen-1-launch">Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1</a> over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">8 Gen 3</a> is one corner that was cut, and to a certain extent, you would be right. However, given the overall package of what the ThinkBook Plus provides, tossing the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 into the tablet would be too much.</p><p>Clearly, this device is the epitome of “overkill” for mobile work, but it would also introduce another layer of potential problems. For one, you’d have to deal with thermals, and what good is having a combination like this if your laptop or tablet is constantly overheating?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CRvc4ELbVzxpdsjwcTXhYX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-17" alt="Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid showing the Android Lock Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRvc4ELbVzxpdsjwcTXhYX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While not quite as performant as its successors, the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 is still more than capable. If anything, I probably would have liked to see the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, but it’s really not that big of a deal.</p><p>Okay, enough of that. What’s it actually like to use this laptop that’s also a tablet, but is actually both? Well, it’s <em>really </em>not any different from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> or a convertible Chromebook. Let me explain.</p><p>With the push of a button, I’m able to switch back and forth between Windows and Android, as there’s a dedicated key in the function row. Fundamentally, it’s not so different when switching from One UI to DeX on a Samsung tablet. The most obvious difference is that I’m going between different operating systems, as opposed to different interfaces.</p><p>Lenovo tries to bridge the gap between Android and Windows in another way, and that’s with the help of File Sync and the Hybrid Folder. There’s a dedicated Hybrid Center app built in on the Windows side, which includes an easy way to launch Hybrid Stream to use both OSes at the same time, along with accessing File Sync settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tqJZ42MjmW4CtmgyGYJ4cX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-13" alt="Close-up on the Hybrid switch key on the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqJZ42MjmW4CtmgyGYJ4cX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hybrid Folder is rather nifty in that it gives a folder that’s shared between devices, without needing to really configure anything. So I can toss files into it, and know that they’ll be synced, regardless of what OS I’m using. The only limitation is that the Hybrid Folder is limited to 25GB in size.</p><p>That might seem a bit frustrating, but not all hope is lost. When using Windows, you can access the storage of the Hybrid Tab, and transfer files back and forth as if it were a USB drive. No, the files won’t be synced between the two, but it’s definitely come in handy on a few occasions.</p>

<p>Most of the time, I’m using the ThinkBook Plus the same way that I use any other laptop or tablet that lands on my doorstep. Why? Because this is the most (relatively) compact and easiest option to use Windows and Android side-by-side.</p><p>It also lets me compartmentalize things while also letting me use Android apps in Windows, something that is no longer easy to do thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-is-killing-support-for-running-android-apps-on-windows-11">Microsoft dropping support for WSA</a>. There are ways around that with Windows, but I don’t have to fiddle around with that, thanks to the ThinkBook Plus.</p>

<p>Up to this point, I think it’s safe to say that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed using the ThinkBook Plus. While that’s definitely the case, the “honeymoon phase” actually wore off pretty quickly.</p><p>For one, this thing is a behemoth to carry, whether it be in a backpack or just walking from room to room. Every time I pick it up, I feel like it takes more effort than it should. Part of that is just a “me” thing, as I went from using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>, which weighs just north of 2.5 pounds, to the ThinkBook Plus, coming in at almost four pounds. Talk about a night and day difference.</p><p>It’s not so bad when detaching the screen and just using the tablet, but that leads me to another pain point. While the ThinkBook Plus Hybrid feels like it’s built like a tank, I’m still worried that something is going to break when I try to detach the Tab from the Station.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kyFfTz6KGaSJgyQPbSBicX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-14" alt="Close-up on the display connector mechanism on the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyFfTz6KGaSJgyQPbSBicX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That feeling hasn’t changed at all since I started using the ThinkBook Plus, and I don’t know if it ever will change. Part of the problem is that I regularly struggle to actually detach the screen. Per Lenovo’s FAQ, the screen must be at a 90-degree angle (+/- 5 degrees), and then you just pull straight up.</p><p>First, I’m not a fan of just grabbing onto the display, even though I know I won’t break it. It’s just not a very natural feeling, and then I end up needing to grab a microfiber cloth every time I separate the two. I also think Lenovo put the strongest magnets imaginable into this thing, which is obviously a good thing, but it adds a bit of a wrinkle when trying to detach the screen.</p><p>On top of that, even with the incredibly strong magnets helping to line everything up, I either don’t push the screen down far enough or have to give it a few tries before getting things to work. There have been a couple of occasions when I would reattach the screen, think that everything was working fine, and try to fire up Hybrid Stream, only to be told that I needed to disconnect the screen and try again.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Y6xL4A6XGy5bse4VTDQ5cX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-15" alt="McAfee warning message on the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6xL4A6XGy5bse4VTDQ5cX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While convenience and flexibility are the goal, I can’t help but wonder how many people are going to struggle with this, too, and just end up never removing the display. At this point, that kind of defeats part of the purpose of what the ThinkBook Plus aims to provide.</p><p>Something else that really got on my nerves was the reminder that I wasn’t using the included 100W charging brick every time I plugged the laptop in. I <em>know</em> that the charger I was using isn’t 100W, but it’s 65W, and I still charged the ThinkBook Plus perfectly fine, even if it was slightly slower. Stop reminding me, and don’t put a special icon on the battery indicator just as a reminder.</p><p>Last but certainly not least, we have to talk about the elephant in the room: price. Lenovo’s “Estimated Value,” or retail price, for the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is listed at an eye-watering $3,518. For that, you could have grabbed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, Galaxy Chromebook Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a>, AND the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>.</p><p>However, if you head over to Lenovo’s website at the time of this writing, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is “discounted” to $2,753. Sure, that’s a savings of almost $1,000, but it’s still going to be a steep hill to climb for anyone who’s even remotely interested in a device like this.</p>

<p>Let's be honest here — there's nothing quite like the ThinkBook Plus. There are 2-in-1's, tablet PCs with detachable keyboards, and even laptops that have two screens built-in. None of those quite offer the same experience as what Lenovo is attempting to achieve.</p><p>It was rather difficult trying to find devices that could be considered as competition to the ThinkBook Plus. The first one that popped into my head was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Microsoft Surface Pro 11</a>. It's kind of the "ultimate" 2-in-1 device, blending an ultra-sleek design with incredible performance. This is especially true now that it seems like Microsoft has figured out a software transition layer for the Qualcomm CPU.</p><p>The other device that came to mind was the Microsoft Surface Book, which too featured a detachable display. However, we haven't seen a refresh since 2022, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-laptop-studio-2-review">Surface Laptop Studio 2</a> has seemingly taken its place. Although the display can't be removed, it does swing out and lay down so you can use it like a tablet.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want (or need) both a Windows and an Android device</li><li>You enjoy having truly unique pieces of technology</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You need something lightweight</li></ul>
<p>On one hand, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is something that I <em>want</em> to recommend to anyone and everyone. On the other, I think that between the price and how cumbersome it can be to detach the screen, it needs a bit more time in the oven.</p><p>However, I'm really (and I mean REALLY) hoping that Lenovo doesn't give up on this idea. Lenovo has a tendency to try out different things, releasing one iteration and then moving on to something else. I'd like to see Lenovo continue attempting to refine the design to make it both less heavy and somehow easier to detach the screen.</p><p>Even still, I won't lie and say that I haven't thought about picking one of these up for myself. Between the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid and my foldable phones, it truly makes me feel like I'm living in the future.</p>

A Reddit post brought to light the ability to delete watermarks on images via this new experimental feature (as spotted first by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/16/people-are-using-googles-new-ai-model-to-remove-watermarks-from-images/">Tech Crunch</a>).</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/1jbt0md/gemini_is_pretty_good_in_removing_watermarks">Gemini is pretty good in removing watermarks</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity">r/singularity</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As seen in a series of images on the Reddit post above, the user uploaded an image filled with watermarks onto Gemini's latest model and attempted to delete the watermarks. This resulted in a clearer image free from unnecessary watermarks; however, Gemini left its logo behind on the generated image, making sure that people were aware that the image in question had been edited.</p><p>It did the same thing with images from Shutterstock, Istock, and Getty images, platforms that require a subscription fee to rid images of their watermarks. According to the publication, Gemini 2.0 Flash appears to struggle with certain semi-transparent watermarks and watermarks that canvas large portions of images.</p><p>That said, removing watermarks without consent is illegal and could pull the person or organization doing it into unnecessary lawsuits. On another X post showcasing watermarks being removed from Getty images, a user stated this morning (Mar. 17) that they were no longer able to generate images without a watermark on AI Studio.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just tried it, and Gemini refused to do it.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1901616663155618079">March 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This suggests that Google could've noticed the growing trend of people doing this and pulled the plug on this specific prompt.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google about the above, and we'll update this article once we have more information.</p>

Based on our time with the Oura Ring 4 — and Oura Health's long list of currently unused patents — here is our Oura Ring 5 wishlist and predictions.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oura-ring-5-patents-that-could-appear"><span>Oura Ring 5: Patents that could appear</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZkXoTzFy6y6BsBtproFiuJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gestures-camera.jpg" alt="Using the Galaxy Ring gesture to take a photo with the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZkXoTzFy6y6BsBtproFiuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Taking a picture with a pinching gesture on the Galaxy Ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oura has hundreds of patents, both filed and accepted by the USPTO, and a patent is no guarantee that a feature will be used in the Oura Ring 5. Some features stay as ideas for a reason. Still, we're highlighting potential Oura Ring 5 features that we think <em>could</em> be useful in the next-gen ring based on these patents.</p><p><strong>Smart gestures:</strong> Patent US-12216829-B2 for "Ring-inputted commands" explains that buttons or screens on a smart ring "may detract from the aesthetic appeal," so they need a way for a ring to trigger actions via "some action or movement, such as by tapping or rotating the wearable device, performing some hand gesture, and the like."</p><p>This is very similar to the pinching motion control you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>, but Oura envisions multiple "input command patterns" for things like "tagging information or events (e.g., tagging alcohol/caffeine consumption), starting/ending a workout, causing a user device to take a picture, adjusting or activating/deactivating external devices (e.g., speakers, smart lights, smart appliances, thermostats, other household electronics), performing an authentication procedure...activating sensors of a wearable device (e.g., performing an ECG measurement) and the like."</p><p>If Oura delivers these kinds of smarts and can make the commands distinct enough from normal hand movement to avoid false positives, this could make the Oura Ring 5 much "smarter" and more dynamic — but also more complicated.</p>

<p><strong>Modular add-ons: </strong>Patent US-12177997-B2 for "Functional cover with wireless connection for ring wearable" discusses a significant problem with smart rings: you can't easily replace the battery or other faulty parts, forcing the user to buy a new model or the manufacturer to replace it when it begins to fail. Its suggested solution is "functional covers" or "modules" that "incorporate additional components and/or update existing functionality of the wearable device."</p><p>It suggests types of add-on covers like a "battery module, a fitness tracker module, an air quality module, a wireless communications module, a location module, a safety module, a self-identification or authentication module (e.g., module to authenticate the user for purchases, entry to restricted locations), etc."</p><p>The Oura Ring 5 would hypothetically have removable elements to make attaching modules easier or "inductive" components that couple with the electronics in the attachable covers. It all sounds quite complicated, but a modular Oura Ring 5 would allow power users to buy and add additional functions over time or augment its battery life as it naturally loses capacity.</p><p><strong>GPS tracking: </strong>This straightforward patent — US-20230065695-A1 for "Location-based activity tracking — suggests that automatically detected activities could use GPS data to map workouts within the Oura app. The patent defaults to phone-based GPS but suggests that the Oura Ring itself "may be enabled with GPS or other positioning capabilities." No smart ring has a GPS antenna yet due to the major battery requirements and signal challenges, but it'd be intriguing if Oura somehow made the Ring 5 the first.</p>

<p><strong>A major redesign: </strong>There are several patents related to the idea of making a universal Oura Ring 5 that fits any finger size, instead of having to make one for each size. Patent US-20250064398-A1 for "Conformable wearable device with deformable shape" suggests their next smart ring could be "manufactured in one size...as a straight piece rather than in ring form."</p><p>Depending on your finger size, the Ring 5 edges "may overlap after rolling around the wearable device, form a gap between the edges, or align." The patent almost describes it like a smartwatch that coils around your finger but can be safely broken apart at any time to then attach to another finger (or person).</p>

<p>Another patent (US-20250009085-A1) shows a "C-ring form factor" with a connective bridge between the two ends. Instead of a one-size design, this C-ring design would "transition between multiple discrete ring sizes (e.g., between U.S. ring sizes 6-8)," letting Oura manufacture fewer versions and users swap between sizes to wear it on different fingers.</p><p>One particularly outlandish patented idea (US-20250009086-A1) is to design the next Oura Ring with "multiple rings for adjustable circumference," letting you remove some inner rings based on your finger size. We don't think this one will end up happening, but it shows that Oura is willing to try anything.</p>

<p>Finally, another fascinating patent (US-20250000218-A1) has a "deformable inner cover" that uses a "memory shape polymer" to bulge or contract to counterbalance when your finger enlarges or shrinks due to environmental or physiological factors, helping the next Oura Ring deliver "more accurate physiological data measurements."</p><p><strong>Universal charger: </strong>The Oura Ring 4 has a fitted charger for each ring size. If Oura redesigns the Oura Ring 5 with multiple sizes, then it will need a flexible charger as well. Patent US-20240396371-A1 discusses chargers that "magnetically attract a magnetic component" in order to "align charging coils" between ring and charger.</p>

<p><strong>Haptic feedback: </strong>We've always liked the idea of haptic notifications on smart rings, but only Circular has added a vibration motor to one of its rings and cut the feature from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a>. So we're intrigued to see Oura patent the idea of providing "feedback" to users with methods like "vibrations, audio tones, changing temperature or pressure."</p><p>In patent US-20240371493-A1, they suggest an Oura ring could detect high blood pressure and send a vibrating alert to warn them. Then, "if the user's blood pressure did not decrease following the feedback, the wearable device may increase the magnitude of subsequent tactile vibrations to more forcefully indicate the user should take action to reduce their blood pressure."</p><p>While the main focus seems to be using vibrations as a "sixth sense" to help users "realize when they are stressed," the patent also mentions other potential "objectives" like vibrating based on your current heart rate zone during a workout, vibrating when you're approaching a turn while following directions, or even vibrating when you're facing north.</p><p>Whatever Oura does with this feature, it suggests we <em>could</em> get a haptic motor in a future Oura Ring.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3590px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="wQLXUwnKYzCT52CMfPCgSj" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-08.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on an index finger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQLXUwnKYzCT52CMfPCgSj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3590" height="2019" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've already covered in the section above how the Oura Ring 5 could have a <strong>flexible design</strong> to bend to multiple sizes, a <strong>haptic motor</strong>, <strong>gesture recognition</strong>, a <strong>removable battery</strong> or <strong>add-on covers</strong>, and (though it's unlikely) <strong>built-in GPS</strong>.</p><p>Now, we'll focus on what Oura Ring 5 features we'd <em>like</em> to see, based on our time with the Oura Ring 4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oura-ring-gen-3-review">Ring 3</a>, as well as other smart rings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>.</p><p><strong>NFC support</strong>: One of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-will-stay-niche-until-missing-features-added">most-wanted smart ring features</a> is an option to make contactless payments. Authentication would be simple: When you put on your ring, you must go into the Oura app and enter your PIN or pattern to enable tap-to-pay. From that point on, your Oura Ring 5 would be authenticated to make payments with your phone in your pocket, or even with your phone at home.</p><p>But the moment you remove your Oura Ring 5, the NFC chip would be disabled until you entered your credentials again; that way, no one can go on a spending spree if you leave it on a bathroom sink or someone snatches it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZTBQd32nc6trm5PhMVmu9A" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-13.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4 on a phone with the Oura app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZTBQd32nc6trm5PhMVmu9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>New health functions:</strong> The Oura Ring 4 already takes a holistic approach to health and wellness. The one missing feature we'd love to see on the Ring 5 is either an ECG for active AFib detection or passive irregular heart rhythm notifications.</p><p>Since at least one Oura patent mentions blood pressure, it'd be cool if the Ring 5 could provide continuous data and (optionally) buzz your finger if you're stressed or experiencing hypertension.</p><p>In addition, since so many smartwatch brands seem to be working on non-invasive blood glucose monitoring, could we get that same kind of sensor in a smart ring? We don't know if Oura could pull it off, but it'd certainly be useful for diabetics.</p><p>Otherwise, given how we've seen smart ring rivals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/we-saw-three-potential-futures-for-smart-rings-at-ces">positioning themselves as medical-grade devices</a>, maybe it's less about <em>new</em> features and more about Oura giving the Ring 5 enhanced accuracy. Oura had its $96 million Pentagon contract <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://idtechwire.com/pentagon-cancels-96m-biometric-ring-contract-amid-privacy-concerns/" target="_blank">canceled this March</a>, so it may be looking for other business or medical opportunities beyond its usual consumer sector. That may require FDA-approved accuracy claims.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-wideband (or just better Find My Ring tracking):</strong> Our Oura Ring 4 reviewer has lost several Oura Rings in the past, which we love to tease him about. But he does have a legitimate complaint that they're very easy to lose track of.</p><p>There's a Find My Ring function for iOS, but not Android still; that needs to be fixed soon, but it should be resolved before the Ring 5 ships. By that time, we'd love to see ultra-wideband added because the last-location feature can only show its vague location. If the ring's fallen inside a couch cushion, only something like ultra-wideband would let you hone in on its exact location. Plus, UWB would let you use your ring as a digital car key.</p>

<p><strong>A tiny or embedded display:</strong> This would move the Oura Ring 5 from the "smart jewelry" category into something more tech-heavy and potentially gimmicky, so we're not sure we truly <em>want</em> a ring screen that would require a thicker design and extra battery life drain. But let's at least <em>talk</em> about it!</p><p>What if Oura could add a small, square display like you see on hybrid watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a>? Your smart ring would look "normal" unless you made an artificial gesture to trigger the screen and see information or unless you set it to light up with notification icons to see what's triggering the buzz in your pocket.</p><p>The display itself could be something subtle, like a grayscale OLED embedded like a gem at the top, or else built into the glass layer around the ring so the text can light up but otherwise remain invisible.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc" name="Oura-Ring-4-colors-2.jpg" alt="Oura Ring 4 in different colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2VXbzrrwUpGnHjMAUKPQqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>An even slimmer design: </strong>The Oura Ring 4 only weighs about 3–5g and measures less than 3mm thick. That's very impressive considering how much it can track, and if it adds more health data or a haptic motor, I can't see it getting any skinnier.</p><p>But let's imagine that all of those patents are just about Oura weighing its options, and that its Oura Ring 5 will focus less on gimmicks and more on style. In that case, it's fair to argue that the Ring 4 still has that distinct "smart ring look," and is much thicker than a "normal" ring.</p><p>If Oura can bring the Ring 5 closer to the range of a traditional skinny ring while still delivering accurate health sensor data, that might be the best way of making it more popular with mainstream users.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A new partnership between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ggwp.com/">GGWP</a> and Another Axiom — the developers of Gorilla Tag — means that those annoying kids in Gorilla Tag can no longer call you the "hard R" word and get away with it. GGWP announced in a March 17 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250312575564/en/GGWP-Adds-Proactive-Voice-Moderation-to-be-the-Safety-Partner-for-Unitys-Vivox-Voice-Chat">press release</a> that Gorilla Tag's Vivox-powered voice chat would now be "proactively monitored" by the company's advanced context-aware AI engine.</p><p>Proactive moderation means that offensive words are not only reported as such but that a "360-degree view of the user's positive and negative behavior" is also included in that report. From a cursory glance, it seems a bit like Big Brother or Minority Report. Still, it's a huge step forward in ensuring that the millions of Gorilla Tag players who frequent the game every month feel like the developer has their backs when dealing with offensive players.</p><p>This should be a big upgrade over the previous system, which mainly relied on user reports and was sometimes poisoned by "group think" and peer pressure. If you've ever played any online game for more than a few minutes, you'll know that online voice chat has a huge moderation problem. This issue is compounded in games like Gorilla Tag, where voice chat is the only real way to communicate with other players.</p><p>The bar of entry for a free-to-play game like Gorilla Tag is incredibly low. All you need to do to play the game is install it. The account system is already built into headsets like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>, making them even easier to play than free mobile games that often require external accounts. It's this ease of play that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">created a huge shift</a> in players joining free-to-play games more often on the Quest, causing new problems for companies trying to moderate the space.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GJNYDyisYrpd53Ec8itnoV" name="gorilla-tag-screenshot-official-01" alt="An official screenshot of four different players in Gorilla Tag showcasing different outfits and headgear" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJNYDyisYrpd53Ec8itnoV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Another Axiom)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's alarming enough to join a game and hear screaming kids all around you, but it's even more alarming to hear those same <em>children</em> call you a racial slur or talk like a sailor as if such behavior were completely normal. Both of these situations can be off-putting enough to make someone quit a game forever, which is just part of why moderation like GGWP's is necessary.</p><p>But Another Axiom says it isn't just relying on AI to moderate. We've seen AI moderation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-needs-get-its-shit-together-2021">fail in the past</a>, so the company is also partnering with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.arise.com/gaming/community-moderation/">Arise</a> to include a human component to the equation. This paid crew of moderators is around 24/7 to address issues and provide support, both before and after someone gets banned.</p><p>Of course, it's not just the kids who say this stuff that's the problem. Sometimes, kids will be pressured into saying something they don't understand, getting them banned. It's these situations where GGWP and Arise can really help pick apart the nuance, giving light bands to the person who said something offensive but also helping get to the root of the matter by figuring out the players who did the pressuring in the first place.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Proactive AI moderation, in conjunction with paid human moderation, may finally solve the problem of offensive players.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another Axiom already allowed a wave of previously banned players back into the fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anotheraxiom.com/news-posts/2025-community-roadmap">a few weeks back</a>, noting that players who are banned in the future can seek appeals via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.gorillatagvr.com/ban-appeal/">official support page</a> or the game's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dyno.gg/form/975514e0">official Discord server</a>. This should be a good test of the system, ensuring that players who previously caused offense have learned their lesson (or not).</p><p>As a player who just started their virtual career in the developer's newest game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/orion-drift-is-the-new-echo-vr">Orion Drift</a>, it's music to my ears to see this kind of moderation finally coming onboard. It feels like this should have happened years ago, but better late than never, I'd say. I was told this tech is also coming to Orion Drift, so players in that game can rest easy knowing there will be swift repercussions for bad behavior.</p><p>One of the biggest reasons I haven't typically allowed my son to play online games with voice chat is because people can be so unhinged online. Without the threat of getting punched in the face — something that would happen in real life if you talked like some of these kids do online — people can get incredibly rude and downright nasty. We see it on social media all the time, and it's worse in an unmoderated voice chat.</p>

<p>I'm really glad to see Another Axiom implementing policies that not only protect our kids but also any player who bears the brunt of this kind of language. You'll even find a new "Forest Guide" player in the game's Discord, ensuring that players who are overtly friendly and helpful get recognized for their actions, while offensive jerks just get banned for life.</p><p>I would love to see Meta partner with developers to extend this kind of technology to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a>. While Gorilla Tag's massive community means that this kind of thing is more common than in smaller games — there's always a percentage of downright offensive players, so larger player bases simply mean more bad players — the issue is still present elsewhere.</p><p>This, of course, isn't just a VR problem, but as voice chat is the primary means of communication in virtual worlds, it's vitally important to implement technology like this to ensure future players stay around for the long haul instead of leaving over a problem that could have been avoided.</p>

<p><em><strong>Charles asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Is buying Gemini Advanced worth the price? I like that it comes with Google One storage, but it's double the price of my current 2TB plan and I'm wondering if the AI features are worth it.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks in advance.</strong></em></p>
<p>Heya Charles! That's a great question and one I have asked myself several times. An extra $10 a month (the "Premium" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One plan</a> is $10 per month and the "AI Premium" plan is $20) isn't a lot of money but every penny counts. It needs to be worth it before anyone should just buy into it.</p><p>The answer isn't going to be the same for everyone, of course. Some people benefit from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-advanced-subscribers-can-now-use-gemini-flash-2-0-experimental-in-latest-gemini-app-beta">Gemini Advanced</a> features like Gemini in Gmail or the extra tokens for analyzing a ton of data, but I think most people — myself included — aren't going to see $10 worth of benefit.</p>
<p>I don't know your exact needs, so let's take a look at what Gemini Advanced has to offer.</p><p><strong>More capable AI models.</strong> Gemini Advanced uses the latest, and presumably best, AI training before it trickles down to the free tier of Gemini. It could mean you get better and more relevant responses to any query, whether it's conversational or something more intricate like data mining a document.</p><p><strong>Priority access to new features.</strong> You'll get to try out the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">AI tools</a> before free users have access to them. This could be both a blessing and a curse.</p><p><strong>A 1 million token context window. </strong>Gemini can analyze bigger and more complex documents with a larger token window. This is one of those things you would <em>know</em> you need, so if you ask about it, you probably don't. If you ever tried to feed Gemini a document and it told you it was too large, more tokens would help.</p><p><strong>NotebookLM Plus.</strong> This is probably the best feature of the Premium AI plan, and if you are a student or need to keep track of information so it's organized in a meaningful way, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">Notebook LM</a> is perfect. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-new-features-december-2024/" target="_blank">The Plus version</a> gives you features like more sources, better sharing, and enhanced privacy from Google's cyber-eyes. I wish this was offered as a stand-alone option.</p><p><strong>Gemini in Gmail, Docs, and Google Meet.</strong> If you want Gemini to help you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmails-new-gemini-feature-turns-messy-notes-into-polished-emails-in-a-snap">write better emails</a> or build better presentations, this could be worth it. It also enhances your video quality in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-10-google-meet-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Meet</a> so everyone can see if you dusted your bookshelf or not.</p>
<p>Listing what is offered is the easy part. Deciding if you need or want any of it is a little harder. As mentioned, I think Notebook LM Plus is almost worth the extra costs and is the only reason I would even consider paying for Gemini Advanced.</p><p>However, I asked around the office, and my colleagues agreed with me. The value just isn't there, especially when most of the features will trickle down to the free tier in time.</p><p>Without knowing your exact needs, I would suggest you look into how much you use AI right now, then decide if any of these features would make you use it more. Best of all, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini" target="_blank">try it free for a month</a> to help you decide, and you totally should. That's what I did before I decided that I <em>didn't</em> need to pay the extra cost, and I have no regrets.</p>

<hr>
<p>Fitbit has reportedly kicked off its latest Labs experiment for users interested in determining the best sleep schedule for them.</p><p>The latest Fitbit Labs test, called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/14566053#zippy=%2Cpersonalized-sleep-schedule-lab%2Cwhat-is-the-personalized-sleep-schedule-lab">Personalized Sleep Schedule</a>," was spotted in an updated support document (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/17/fitbit-personalized-sleep-schedule-lab/">9to5Google</a>). According to Fitbit, this experiment involves energy level surveys for users "multiple times a day." The company says its software will analyze your responses and provide an "evening sleep schedule" later in the day. The goal is to ensure your energy levels are high the next day if you're feeling sluggish or tired.</p><p>Fitbit explains each survey is roughly two minutes long, beginning in the morning. The "Morning Check-in" will question users about "what might impact your upcoming's night sleep." Moreover, the survey/free-form questions won't last all day as Fitbit states you have until 10 AM (your local timezone) to get it done.</p><p>Following this will be a series of "Daytime" surveys. These are quicker — only one question — but ask you to "rate" your energy levels. Fitbit says users will see three of these one-question surveys following its morning survey. Lastly, there's the "evening bedtime check-in."</p><p>Upon completion of this final survey, users will receive their personalized schedule. In the evening, Fitbit will run a two-minute survey about the factors that could hinder your nightly rest.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ymdSSzjLMx2zACaJskXdEM" name="fitbit-sleep-track-tile-google-pixel-watch.jpg" alt="Fitbit Sleep Tracking Tile on Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ymdSSzjLMx2zACaJskXdEM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fitbit mentions factors that could "impact" your sleep quite often in this test, which it explains regards things like your lifestyle, environment, medical conditions, and medication. If you experience a lot of stress in your daily life or have sleeping disorders or may have a lot of noise at night, these are all things that could impact your nightly rest.</p><p>Fitbit likely provided these examples to give users an idea of what it will ask for and look to hear when its surveys come around. The company also states its Personalized Sleep Schedule test utilizes generative AI to assist users. Fitbit says its AI "may occasionally generate inaccurate or misleading information." As such, it encourages users to wear their Fitbit device (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch</a>) as often as possible for the "best results."</p><p>It doesn't appear that this test has arrived for all users quite yet. When it does, go into the "You" tab of the Fitbit and see if the Labs experiment box is there. If it is, users can proceed with signing up and trying it out. If it's not there, Fitbit recommends trying again at a later date.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-sleep-labs-experiment-grounds-test-spotted">internal code</a> for Fitbit's sleep Labs test was first spotted toward the final weeks of February. Most of what was alluded to seems to have come to form in the experiment's official rollout for enrolled testers. The surveys are the largest part of the test as it helps the AI determine <em>when </em>you should go to bed after factoring in everything that could hinder you. Fitbit Labs kicked off in October with "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fitbit-labs-insight-explorer-test-gemini-start">Insight Explorer</a>" to help Gemini better understand you and your health/wellness goals.</p>

According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/google-taps-mediatek-cheaper-ai-chips?rc=bdqvyp">The Information</a>, the tech giant could be collaborating with Taiwan's chip maker MediaTek.</p><p>These chips also known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), would be produced sometime next year, sources close to the project told the publication. It is important to note that Google makes its chips that help train its AI models. However, it relies on Broadcom, an American chip company, to design its TPUs with the help of blueprints provided by Google. This has been the case ever since Google produced its first-gen TPU back in 2015.</p><p>However, now, after almost a decade of working together, it has decided to broaden its reach. This collab with MediaTek doesn't indicate Google breaking ties with Broadcom but is being frugal about how much it spends on designing its TPUs.</p><p>As of today, Google TPUs are custom-designed chips used for training large AI models like Gemini and are ideal for training chatbots, code generation, media content generation, and personalization models, among others. It also produces another kind of TPU that deals with "interference needs" and powers its existing services like Search and YouTube, The Information added.</p>

<p>The reason it could be making the switch to MediaTek could be because it charges less per chip compared to Broadcom and has a strong relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited), The Information stated.</p><p>An internal source told the publication that it might be doing things differently with MediaTek; it will handle most of the design of its next TPU, including the processor. "MediaTek will aim to handle what are known as input/output modules, which manage the communication between the main processors and peripheral components, said one of the two people involved in the project."</p><p>But much like Broadcom, it will handle the chip production process, "which includes packaging and quality testing," another source from Google's TPU team told the Information.</p><p>Last year, Google seems to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/google-preparing-partner-with-taiwans-mediatek-next-ai-chip-information-reports-2025-03-17/">spent between $6 billion and $9 billion </a>to create one of the most powerful 6th-generation TPUs, according to Reuters. But if it does take the MediaTek route, it could be spending much less and will also give Google an upper hand over other AI companies like ChatGPT and Microsoft, which both rely on American-based chipmakers.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to both Google and MediaTek about this and will update the article when we have more information.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung is working on a Good Lock module that gives users access to an "expansion" of Now Bar features.</li><li>These features are more customization-focused as users could alter its animations, size, and more on the lock screen.</li><li>Samsung dropped a major customization update for its Home Up Good Lock module while also updating the Now Bar experience via Always On Display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>One UI 7 brings a multitude of changes, but a recent rumor claims Samsung could have more in store for one lock screen feature.</p><p>As rumored by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Tonysamsunglove/status/1899818224637591847">Tony Tech on X</a>, Samsung is supposedly looking into creating a dedicated Good Lock module for One UI 7's Now Bar (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/now-bar-in-one-ui-7-might-get-good-lock-customization-module/">SamMobile</a>). The tipster claims the module will "expand" the Now Bar's customization with a series of new features. The lock screen widget's primary purpose is to deliver quick bits of important information, so rumors claim it might feature "forced support for all third-party apps."</p><p>Additionally, considering its lock screen presence, the post suggests the Good Lock module could offer color and size customization options.</p><p>Rumors add the module would give users control over the widget's animations, letting you "remove" and "insert" new ones, potentially. The post ends by purporting the rumored module will be dubbed "NOWBAR," but that remains to be seen as no further evidence has been discovered yet.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">is rumored around. samsung is developing application for Good lock module called NOWBAR. which expands new features. - change color, like- Changing Size nowbar- Remove and insert animations - Forced support all third-party apps Only rumors going around from the web 🫣<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1899818224637591847">March 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The idea of Samsung bringing total Now Bar customization <em>could </em>work, especially when you remember it dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">Good Lock update for Home Up</a>. After the update was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-good-lock-module-customization-update-spotted">rumored last fall</a>, Samsung finally started rolling it out for One UI 7-capable devices (the Galaxy S25). The Home Up patch blew open the doors of customization for users as Samsung delivered the freedom over the size and orientation of your apps, widgets, and folders.</p><p>In short, the typical grid rules apps and the like are forced to adhere to are out the window. A demo showcased how this could work in more detail for users interested in trying out the "DIY Home" editing button.</p><p>The Now Bar was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-lock-screen-now-bar-update-rollout">subject to a recent update</a> through the Always On Display module in Good Lock. The update focused on improving the experience of it by delivering more awareness and agency behind notifications. More importantly, users could better customize which sports leagues and teams they'd like their Now Bar to update them on.</p><p>Many Galaxy users without a Galaxy S25 are still awaiting One UI 7; however, Samsung confirmed the update will hit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">eligible devices in April</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Pebble is reportedly sending emails to consumers who signed up for updates about its next-gen devices about a pending announcement.</li><li>Tomorrow, March 18, at 12 pm EDT, Pebble will reveal something new, which is expected to be its next wave of smartwatches.</li><li>In January, PebbleOS was open-sourced by Google and its original founder, Eric Migicovsky, confirmed there were plans to revive the series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>For those looking forward to what's next from Pebble, the company is hyping up its consumers with a new announcement.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/17/pebble-smartwatch-reboot-launch-countdown/">9to5Google</a> highlights an email Pebble community users are receiving early this week about what's next for the brand. Users are being directed to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/countdown">RePebble Store page</a>, which is devoid of any products. However, the page features a smartwatch in the center with a running countdown that confirms something new will take place tomorrow, March 18.</p><p>According to the publication, Pebble's email to users states "Time to get excited!" The company says users should prepare for an announcement tomorrow at 12 pm EDT/9 am PDT.</p><p>Aside from the date, Pebble's email doesn't explain or tease what exactly users can expect to be revealed (like a design teaser or the like). The publication speculates tomorrow's event could hold a reveal of future hardware <em>or </em>earlier availability for orders concerning a product.</p><p>Curiously, the store page Pebble sends users to features a "Get Updates" button, which takes you directly to its sign-up page from January. The page was designed to help consumers show interest in a new generation of Pebble smartwatches. Luckily, we don't have to wait much longer to know for sure what's coming.</p>

<p>Speaking of January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">it was two months ago</a> when Pebble's founder Eric Migicovsky announced plans to revive the series after Google open-sourced PebbleOS. Migicovsky confirmed consumers can expect a "new Pebble-like smartwatch," as well as "the same beloved features." The company's original founder got candid about the devices, stating, "Lessons were learned last time."</p><p>Pebble, while it garnered a great deal of interest during its first run, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/success-and-failure-at-pebble/">failed to keep up</a> with the rising costs. As such, Migicovsky states a next-gen Pebble watch could feature a sunlight-readable e-paper screen, long battery life, physical buttons, and a "hackable" OS for customization purposes.</p><p>If we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pebble-founder-already-has-open-sourced-pebbleos-running-on-new-hardware">jump ahead to February</a> (two weeks later), an update post revealed Pebble already had PebbleOS running on brand-new hardware. There was also word that Migicovsky was heading to Shenzhen, China to meet with factories and suppliers about furthering its hardware, potentially indicating how quickly its development was moving.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is still mum on the Galaxy S25 Edge, but fresh leaks spill the beans on specs, colors, and pricing.</li><li>Expect 256GB and 512GB storage options, both with 12GB of RAM.</li><li>The 256GB model could cost €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung remains tight-lipped about the Galaxy S25 Edge specs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">since its Unpacked debut in January</a>, but leaks just won’t quit. Now, a fresh report has dished out new details about the phone.</p><p>As per a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/03/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-colors-storage-prices.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge is tipped to come in two storage options: 256GB and 512GB, both paired with 12GB of RAM. As for pricing, the 12GB RAM/256GB model is rumored to land somewhere between €1,200 and €1,300 in Europe, which roughly works out to $1,300 to $1,400.</p><p>As for the 512GB version, the report says Samsung might price it between €1,300 and €1,400 in Europe. That’s roughly $1,400 to $1,520, depending on exchange rates.</p><p>It should be noted that Samsung has a long-standing habit of offering more competitive prices in the U.S. compared to the EU, something European buyers have come to expect (and maybe grumble about).</p>
<h2 id="colors-that-scream-premium-2">Colors that scream premium</h2>
<p>The leaked memory and storage specs line up with earlier rumors and certifications for the Galaxy S25 Slim. But what’s new this time is the color options. According to Android Headlines, the Galaxy S25 Edge will come in Titanium Icy Blue, Titanium Jet Black, and Titanium Silver.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-side-comparison-01" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The switch to a titanium build for the Galaxy S25 Edge, as indicated by the color labels, seems like a clear move to justify its expected high price tag. This is a shift from earlier rumors, which pointed to a ceramic body paired with an aluminum frame.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $1,000, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a> kicks off at $1,300. Interestingly, the rumored price of the Galaxy S25 Edge puts it close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung's top-tier Android flagship</a>.</p><p>Whether Samsung’s gamble pays off will depend on how the market reacts, especially since the Galaxy S25 Edge makes some compromises to hit that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs">sleek design</a>. With its expected launch on April 16, we won’t have to wait long to see if the strategy works.</p>

If you bought your phone through a carrier like AT&T, Verizon, or T-Mobile, it's likely your phone is locked and cannot be used for this guide. If your phone isn't unlocked and you're not able to get your carrier to unlock it, this guide won't be of any use.</p></div></div>
<p>Regular software updates are wonderful. Google Pixel phones update every month with new security patches and include Pixel Feature Drops once each quarter. Even though these patches go through lots of testing before being rolled out to the public, a bad one will pop up every once in a while, causing problems that didn't exist before.</p><p>That's exactly what happened with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">March 2025 Google Pixel update</a>. Users have reported all sorts of issues, from screen brightness problems to broken haptics, network connectivity issues, and more. Google has a web-based flash tool that makes going back "easy," but it takes a fair bit of work to get there if you've never done it before. As always with firmware flashing, I wouldn't recommend doing this if the Pixel you want to downgrade is the only phone you have available to use.</p><p>If you still want to take the chance, we recommend charging your phone to 100% and backing things up before going forward. To get flashing, you'll need a computer, USB cable, and developer options enabled on your Pixel phone.</p>
<h2 id="back-it-up-2">Back it up</h2>
<p>Most likely, you've already got Google backup enabled on your phone, but it's always good to make sure before you do something drastic. For this step, you'll need to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> on your Google account. All Google Pixel phones come with a Google One trial, so it's likely you may still have a free trial available even if you don't already pay for it.</p><p>Here's how to verify you've got Google One backup enabled on your Google Pixel.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Settings</strong>.

<h2 id="get-your-phone-ready-2">Get your phone ready</h2>
<p>Rolling back an update isn't a simple click of a button, unfortunately, but Google's Android Flash Tool makes it easy enough so long as you have a computer to plug your phone into. First, you'll need to enable developer options and OEM unlocking. Follow these steps for that:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Settings</strong>. You can find the icon in your app drawer or by swiping down twice on the status bar.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Scroll down to and select <strong>About phone</strong>.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Scroll to the bottom and tap <strong>Build number</strong> seven times until you see the toast notification that developer options have been enabled.</p>

<p><strong>4. </strong>Go back to the main settings window and select <strong>System</strong> from the list.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Scroll down to <strong>Developer options</strong>.</p><p><strong>6. </strong>Find <strong>USB debugging</strong> under the "Debugging" section and enable it.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>Scroll back up and enable <strong>OEM unlocking</strong>. Your phone may ask you to reboot after enabling this.</p>

<p>For this section, I'm using a Windows 11-based PC, but the instructions should be similar for other desktop operating systems. To complete the flashing process, you'll need a USB cable that can connect your phone to your PC. The one that's included with your Google Pixel will work so long as your PC has a USB-C port. Follow these steps to get started:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/images">official Google Pixel factory images page</a>.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Select your device <strong>from the list on the right</strong>. Mine is a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p><strong>3. Scroll down to the build</strong> you want to flash. For this tutorial, I'm using 15.0.0 (AP4A.250205.002, Feb 2025). MAKE SURE you are selecting the right build. If you don't know which one is the right one or are unsure, I would recommend stopping now and waiting for Google to roll out a fixed update.</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Click the <strong>Flash link</strong> next to the build.</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Select <strong>Allow ADB access </strong>on the window that appears.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:48.11%;"><img id="5EEZC3nLEaPPJgGya3YipY" name="google-pixel-android-flash-tool" alt="Selecting the right Pixel model from the list for the Android Flash Tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5EEZC3nLEaPPJgGya3YipY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1827" height="879" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Connect your phone <strong>to your computer</strong> using a USB-C cable.</p><p><strong>7. </strong>An USB Debugging prompt will appear on your computer. Select the <strong>Always allow from this computer</strong> checkbox, then click the <strong>Allow button</strong>.</p>

<p>At this point, your phone should have rebooted and is now in a debug menu. In order to continue, you'll need to tap the <strong>Reselect device</strong> button and select your phone from the list.</p>
<h2 id="roll-back-that-update-2">Roll back that update</h2>
<p>Now that your phone is in the recovery menu, you'll need to unlock the bootloader. The Android Flash Tool gives you a warning that continuing will wipe all data from your device. If you don't want to do that, now is a great time to call it quits. Otherwise, tap the <strong>Start</strong> button.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:561px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.16%;"><img id="JmnVEGvQ6p54G9eCwdgUhG" name="Screenshot 2025-03-14 112322" alt="Unlocking the bootloader using the Android Flash Tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JmnVEGvQ6p54G9eCwdgUhG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="561" height="388" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your phone's display will now ask you to confirm unlocking the bootloader. Click the <strong>Volume up button</strong> to change the action to <strong>Unlock the bootloader</strong>. Click the <strong>power button</strong> to select the unlock action. Your phone may reboot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NBzByRX5cmJ5XNc84n9SJf" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-bootloader-unlock" alt="Unlocking the bootloader on a Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NBzByRX5cmJ5XNc84n9SJf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the bootloader has been unlocked, the Android Flash Tool should automatically begin the flashing process. This can take half an hour or so to finish, so keep your computer awake and your phone plugged into it. Your phone will look like this photo the entire time:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TmaEjqUcnQFu7h8qf22AZg" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-bootloader-01" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro XL on the recovery screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TmaEjqUcnQFu7h8qf22AZg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="finalizing-the-process-2">Finalizing the process</h2>
<p>Once the process has been completed, your phone will reboot and the bootloader will need to be locked again. On your computer, you'll be presented with a dialog to lock the bootloader again. <strong>Tap the start button</strong> when you're ready to continue.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>On your phone, click the <strong>Volume up button</strong> to change the action to <strong>Lock the bootloader</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Click the power button</strong> to lock the bootloader. Your phone will reboot.</p>

<p>From here, your phone should be good as new and back to the Android version you selected. Once you've set the phone up, go ahead and re-enable developer options, then <strong>disable automatic updates</strong> from the developer options list. This will keep your Pixel from automatically updating to the March patch.</p><p>Additionally, you'll want to <strong>disable OEM unlocking</strong> from the list to make sure everything is locked and secure. Otherwise, things like Google Pay may not work properly, and you could be vulnerable to security risks.</p>

<ul><li>ChatGPT can now be set as a default assistant on Android phones.</li><li>A beta version of the app revealed that it shows up in one of the options for the device's digital assistant.</li><li>You can wake ChatGPT by long pressing the home button or any other gesture that you'd use for Google.</li><li>However, the downside is that you cannot invoke it with a voice command or a hot word.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While Google is trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">replace Assistant with Gemini</a>, ChatGPT seems to be on the same mission. The newest Beta version of the app reveals that you can do more with ChatGPT on Android Phones.</p><p>Spotted on the <em>v1.2025.070</em> beta of the app on Android(<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chatgpt-default-assistant-on-android-3535089/">via Android Authority</a>), users can now set ChatGPT as the device’s default assistant app. Not only that, but it will also let them trigger ChatGPT using all the same way you would for Google Assistant or Gemini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CStZtWkcknEbPCyy2WEUrg" name="ChatGPT-Assistant" alt="New app update allows ChatGPT as default assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CStZtWkcknEbPCyy2WEUrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To set ChatGPT as your default assistant, you'd have to head into the device's settings and manually pick ChatGPT as the option under the "Default Digital Assistant App" option.</p><p>Once users have done the above, it will enable them to launch the assistant by either long pressing the home button or swiping from the bottom corner of the screen, while using gesture navigation, the publication added.</p><p>However, having ChatGPT be your default assistant does have its drawbacks. Users cannot wake it with a voice command like you would say "Hey Google."  "As that functionality requires access to privileged APIs only available to trusted, preinstalled apps," Android Authority added.</p><p>However, once triggered with a long press of the home button, you see a circular globe-like animation at the center of the screen, after that users can interact with it as you normally would use ChatGPT.</p><p>Furthermore, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpts-new-ai-tool-does-the-research-so-you-dont-have-to">ChatGPT introduced new AI tools </a>last month, that could help users cut their research time in half. It could mimic the process of a human analyst, scouring through online sources to give users an in-depth report based on their prompt. However, this feature is only available to Pro users, unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">Gemini's Deep Research feature </a>which is free for a couple of prompts after the recent app update.</p>

<ul><li>During the Game Developers Conference, Qualcomm announced its new trio of Snapdragon G processors, headlined by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3.</li><li>Qualcomm claims the G3 Gen 3 offers 30% faster CPU and 28% faster "advanced graphics capabilities" compared to the G3 Gen 2.</li><li>In addition to these new processors, AYANEO, OneXSugar, and Retroid have announced new Android gaming handhelds.</li></ul>
<p>It's been over 18 months since Qualcomm introduced the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, which eventually made its way into several AYANEO gaming handhelds. Fast forward to now, and Qualcomm is back with a trio of gaming-focused processors, which includes the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3.</p><p>This is joined by "Gen 2" iterations of the Snapdragon G2 and Snapdragon G1, all of which hope to provide gaming performance without making too many sacrifices. According to Qualcomm, the G3 Gen 3 stands to provide a 30% boost to CPU performance, which is the same level of improvement between the first two generations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f5s2z52y2EmFNWohrrsorn" name="Snapdragon-G-Series-Specs-Slide" alt="Qualcomm Snapdragon G Series overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f5s2z52y2EmFNWohrrsorn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Graphics performance is said to be 28% faster, which has become quite important given the recent developments in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Windows emulation</a>. For many, the first concern will be that these advancements will result in our devices running hotter, along with a hit to battery life. However, Qualcomm suggests this won't be the case, as the G3 Gen 3 features "greater power optimizations and energy efficiencies."</p><p>Moving down a notch, Qualcomm curiously pointed out that it targeted the 144FPS mark with the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2. This wasn't done with just mobile gaming in mind, but also cloud gaming as like the G3 Gen 3, the G2 Gen 2 brings support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-FI 7</a>. In terms of performance, Qualcomm again claims improvements across the board, with a "2.3x CPU performance increase and 3.8x faster GPU capabilities."</p><p>Last but not least, we have the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2, obviously focused on the more budget-friendly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. Of the trio, the G1 Gen 2 might be the most intriguing. Qualcomm claims it was able to achieve 80% faster CPU performance along with 25% faster GPU performance.</p>

<p>Qualcomm wasn't alone at GDC 2025, as it was joined by the likes of AYANEO, OneXFly, and Retroid. It turns out that we won't have to wait long before seeing new gaming handhelds released with these processors.</p><p>AYANEO only just recently announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-gaming-handheld-is-a-true-homage-to-the-game-boy-micro">Pocket Micro Classic</a>, and now, it has announced two more Android gaming devices. The first of which is the AYANEO Pocket S2, following in the footsteps of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a> which was announced alongside the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2.</p><p>The Pocket S2 will be AYANEO's newest flagship Android handheld thanks to the G3 Gen 3, and the company shared a few tidbits about what to expect. It will feature a 6.3-inch, 2K display while retaining the premium design of its predecessor. While the full spec sheet wasn't revealed, AYANEO did share a brief teaser video showcasing some of the other changes.</p>

<p>These include an all-new cooling system, with the exhaust coming from the back of the Pocket S2, as opposed to the top as we saw in the Pocket S. We're also expecting to see better ergonomics and battery life, which were sticking points from our Pocket S review. AYANEO claims the Pocket S2 will be available sometime this month, but no other details are yet known.</p><p>That's not all AYANEO announced, as it will be releasing another flagship handheld, dubbed the AYANEO Gaming Pad. It essentially looks like the company took the controls from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Pocket EVO</a> and Pocket 2S, and stuck them to the side of the Gaming Pad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1218px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="h3zWKyWmetsav5B5eVvZSZ" name="ayaneo-gaming-pad-details-sheet" alt="AYANEO Gaming Pad Details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h3zWKyWmetsav5B5eVvZSZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1218" height="685" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're not quite yet sure whether you can remove the "Pad" from the grips, but I'm keeping my fingers crossed. That's thanks to the 8.3-inch 2K LCD display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Between the smaller size and the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, this could join the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">Lenovo Legion Tab</a> as an excellent option for those who want a flagship tablet without dealing with a massive screen. The AYANEO Gaming Pad is slated to become "available" in May of this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xB3XHd2Hq5o8YM54iDrsSW" name="onexsugar-colors-on-desk-hero-render" alt="OneXSugar in Black and White propped on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xB3XHd2Hq5o8YM54iDrsSW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OneXFly)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's all for now from AYANEO, but a couple of other handhelds were also announced at GDC 2025. First, we have the OneXSugar Sugar1 handheld, which will be powered by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3.</p><p>However, the processor isn't the story here, as the Sugar1 is a Nintendo DS on steroids. It's being touted as the "world's first Android gaming device" to offer a dual-screen design and one of those displays is actually detachable.</p>

<p>The Sugar1 feels like it belonged in the Transformers movies with all of the various moving parts. Details are still scarce, but the OneXSugar Sugar1 will be "available for preorder" in May of this year.</p><p>Last up we have Retroid, a company that is actually opening pre-orders for its two latest handhelds later this evening. In fact, we can thank Qualcomm and GDC for this, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Pocket Classic</a> is one of those two devices and we've now learned that it will be powered by the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:105.61%;"><img id="FwFFzbJ9UQpPbQTVdCnT4g" name="Retroid-Pocket-PR-Classic-colour" alt="Color options for the Retroid Pocket Classic gaming handheld" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FwFFzbJ9UQpPbQTVdCnT4g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2888" height="3050" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this G1 Gen 2, Retroid is able to offer an affordable vertical gaming handheld that should spark joy for many. In addition to the new chipset, the Pocket Classic comes equipped with up to 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, along with a 1240x1080 AMOLED display and a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>Pre-orders for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/retro-game-system/products/retroid-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Classic</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/collections/frontpage/products/retroid-pocket-flip-2">Pocket Flip 2</a> open tonight at 9:30 PM ET, and pricing starts at $114 for the Classic and $189 for the Flip 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1237px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wyJQKi3RCRCLbYrBSJxGih" name="retroid-next-gen-device-teaser-render" alt="Retroid "Next Generation Device" teaser banner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wyJQKi3RCRCLbYrBSJxGih.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1237" height="696" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rounding out this massive set of announcements, Retroid revealed that it's working on another gaming handheld. However, the only bit of information that we know is that the Snapdragon G2 Gen 2 will be at the helm. Other than that, the silhouette just shows a shadow of a horizontal handheld.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what Retroid is cooking up. Nevertheless, there's definitely no shortage of gaming handhelds to get excited about following the GDC 2025 announcements.</p>

<p>A full-on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> unboxing video just landed on YouTube, giving us a sneak peek at the phone before it’s officially unveiled.</p><p>The video, courtesy of tech reviewer Sahil Karoul, gives us a good look at the Pixel 9a in a soft pastel rose color (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-9a-unboxing-video-hits-youtube-before-big-reveal/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). It arrives a few days after the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range Android phone</a> was shown off from all angles by a leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/another-pixel-9a-leak-shows-off-the-device-in-action">who took it to the Lucha Libre match and filmed the event with it</a>.</p><p>What’s interesting is how the phone breaks away from the usual Pixel design,  meaning it’s got a flat back with a camera module that sits almost completely flush, ditching the chunky camera bump we’ve seen on recent models.</p>
<h2 id="flat-and-boxy-but-chunky-up-front-2">Flat and boxy, but chunky up front</h2>
<p>Sticking to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series design, the 9a goes for a flat, boxy frame that follows a popular trend.</p><p>That said, the front of the phone feels a bit dated, thanks to some pretty chunky bezels around the screen. Moreover, while the phone’s frame is metal, the back uses a matte-finished plastic instead of glass.</p><p>Luckily, the phone is said to come with an IP68 rating, so it can handle accidental spills or dunks without frying its insides.</p><p>As for the screen, the leak points to a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 1080 x 2424 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. It’s said to hit 2,700 nits and comes with Corning’s Gorilla Glass 3 for some extra durability.</p>

<h2 id="solid-but-not-groundbreaking-2">Solid, but not groundbreaking</h2>
<p>According to Karoul, the Pixel 9a will come in two storage options: 128GB and 256GB. The box looks pretty much the same as the ones for the main Pixel 9 models, which suggests there's no charger included in the package.</p><p>The video reveals that the Pixel 9a packs a 5,100mAh battery with 23W wired charging and 7.5W wireless charging.</p><p>If the leaks are on point, the Pixel 9a is packing a Tensor G4 chip and up to 8GB of RAM under the hood.</p><p>The rest of the video shows the host running some performance tests and gaming demos on the Pixel 9a to see how it holds up. The Tensor G4 chip performed solidly in benchmarks and stayed cool under pressure. The clip also throws in some photo and video samples, where the optical image stabilization shines.</p><p>Based on a previous leak, the Pixel 9a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/new-leak-spills-more-details-on-the-upcoming-pixel-9a">could arrive in black, silver, and lilac</a> in addition to the pink colorway.</p><p>You might want to check out the video soon as it could get taken down any minute. The Pixel 9a officially drops on March 19 anyway.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The latest Android 16 beta hints at Pixel Launcher finally getting built-in icon shape customization options, a feature that vanished after Android 12.</li><li>Pixel users currently need third-party launchers for icon customization, but Google’s future update could change that.</li><li>A new 'App Shape & Layout’ menu lets users adjust home screen grid size and pick from six icon styles, including square, arch, and “complex clover.”</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Last week’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 beta release</a> brought some neat behind-the-scenes improvements, with a highlight being the ability to customize your app icon shapes directly in the launcher.</p><p>One of Android’s biggest perks has always been customization. No matter what device you’re rocking, you can swap out the launcher to match your style and even personalize it further with custom icon packs.</p><p>This means that Pixel users have to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-make-custom-icon-android">rely on third-party launchers to tweak icon shapes</a> since stock Android doesn’t offer the option. But signs point to Google finally bringing this feature to the Pixel Launcher.</p><p>It's no secret that Google has been working on a revamped Pixel Wallpaper app, aiming to bring all your home screen customization options under one roof. In a recent deep dive, Android expert Mishaal Rahman wrote that he managed to unlock the new "App shape & layout" menu in the latest Android 16 beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/icon-shape-customization-for-pixel-demo-3535248/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>This feature lets you tweak your home screen grid size under the "Layout" tab and pick from six different icon styles right next door.</p><p>Google hasn’t officially named the icon shapes in the selection menu, but Rahman’s findings uncovered their internal labels: circle (default), square, four-sided cookie, seven-sided cookie, arch, and complex clover.</p>

<p>The options offer a mix of rounded and geometric styles, though fine-tuning icon sizes isn’t an option. Furthermore, the chosen shape only applies to the home screen, app drawer, and folders, meaning icons in the Recents page and settings stick to the default circle.</p><p>This might seem like a new feature, but it’s actually making a comeback. Google first introduced icon shape customization in the Pixel Launcher back in Android 12, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12-material-you-removes-font-icon-shape-customization">only to remove it later for no clear reason</a>.</p><p>Its return is a big deal, especially since Pixel phones pack plenty of cool features, yet the Pixel Launcher itself has barely evolved. Meanwhile, other platforms have leaned into customization, leaving Pixel users without even basic options like icon shape tweaks.</p><p>It’s worth noting that these features are still hidden in the Android 16 Beta 3 build, and there’s no guarantee they’ll make it to the final release. Google’s timeline suggests Android 16 will officially roll out around May or June, but we’ll have to wait and see if this customization feature sticks around.</p>

<ul><li>The AYANEO Pocket S2 will be officially announced on March 17 during GDC 2025.</li><li>This is the successor to the AYANEO Pocket S, which debuted in late 2023 before being released in June 2024.</li><li>Specific details are scarce, but we do know that AYANEO is again partnering with Qualcomm for the chip.</li></ul>
<p>If you're in the market for a new flagship Android gaming handheld, you won't have to wait long. Earlier today, it was confirmed that the AYANEO Pocket S2 will make its debut on March 17 at the Game Developers Conference (GDC). This comes almost a year after the original Pocket S was released, which was the first device to launch with the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/article/873">announcement post</a>, AYANEO explains that it's "once again partnering with Qualcomm," but doesn't reveal anything else. Towards the end of the post, AYANEO tipped everyone off to a new chip, stating the S2 "will make its global debut alongside Qualcomm's newest gaming platform."</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IkQGeM7yS7s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>There hasn't been much in the way of rumors for the AYANEO Pocket S2, which frankly comes as a bit of a surprise. It's only been six months since the AYANEO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Pocket EVO</a> was released, which is powered by the same Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 as the Pocket S. However, besides the internals, the Pocket EVO is a completely different device with its OLED 165Hz display and ergonomic design.</p><p>That being said, we aren't exactly sure what to expect from the Pocket S2. I wouldn't be surprised if AYANEO kept things simple, and didn't alter the overall design very much to keep it in line with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>. However, I'm also hoping to see a screen with at least a 120Hz refresh rate, even if AYANEO sticks with an LCD display as opposed to moving to OLED.</p>

<p>Another big question is just how much will the AYANEO Pocket S2 be priced at. AYANEO largely stands alone when it comes to flagship and premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a>. Pricing for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Handheld-Android-Console-1920x1080-Snapdragon/dp/B0DDKL16YH/">Pocket S starts at $589</a>, while the Pocket EVO is currently $529 for the base model. Even the recently announced Pocket Micro Classic, a stick-less version of the Pocket Micro, can be currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/goods/9048974164213">pre-ordered for $179</a>.</p><p>On the bright side, AYANEO traditionally offers a bit of a discount during the pre-order phase that usually takes place on Indiegogo. The only difference has been the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneos-latest-gaming-handheld-is-a-true-homage-to-the-game-boy-micro">Pocket Micro Classic</a> which can only be pre-ordered directly.</p><p>Thankfully, we don't have to wait much longer for AYANEO to spill the details about the Pocket S2. GDC 2025 kicks off on Monday, March 17, meaning we only have to wait a couple of days before everything is revealed.</p>

<p>Garmin-loving runners are eagerly awaiting a new Garmin Forerunner 975 or Forerunner 275. The last models launched in March 2023, but we've yet to see any concrete leaks despite the usual two-year gap.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://the5krunner.com/2025/03/08/garmin-fcc-report-is-this-the-forerunner-975/">5Krunner</a> excited everyone by suggesting a mystery Garmin device at the FCC might be the Forerunner 975; a closer look suggested it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://device.report/m/cf9d1968917916f5cd6965c82aeb0588c496a34843fda4b364af90c880fd0dc1">rectangular, non-watch device</a>, meaning the Forerunners still aren't imminent. But the mere suggestion set my brain racing on what the new 975 and 275 should offer whenever they do arrive.</p><p>I've reviewed about a dozen Garmin watches, and the Forerunner series has always catered directly to me as a runner and hiker. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> has obvious perks to justify the $1,100 price tag, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a> remains my favorite smartwatch I've ever worn. I'm predictably excited for the next one!</p><p>Maybe Garmin thought March 2025 would put the new Forerunners too close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a> launch, or its schedule is still messy after the three-year wait for the MIP <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-955-review">Forerunner 955</a>, followed by a nine-month wait for the AMOLED 965.</p><p>Either way, I think it's fair to expect a Forerunner 275 and 975 in the next three months, and I think it'll be the most important launch Garmin has this year. Why? It'll show whether Garmin has any new ideas for serious runners and their training — or if it'll rely on incremental upgrades and gimmicks.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-the-post-amoled-plan-garmin-2">What's the post-AMOLED plan, Garmin?</h2>

<p>The Garmin Venu series started the company's AMOLED experiment, but it was really the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a> and 965 launch in 2023 that, in hindsight, kicked off AMOLED as the new normal. Since then, the Fenix, Vivoactive, and Instinct lineups have transitioned partially or fully to AMOLED.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-leak-suggests-fenix-8-microled-watch-coming-but-reasons-for-skepticism">Garmin is working on MicroLED displays</a>, but I'd expect them to be expensive add-ons for a Fenix or MARQ first. So what's the <em>next</em> defining change for Garmin watches?</p><p>Garmin spent the last few years pushing useful tools like multi-band GPS and improved Elevate health sensors across its sub-brands. Most recently, we've seen flashy hardware changes like the mic/speaker on the Venu 3 and the flashlight on the Instinct 3.</p><p>But there are signs that the rate of innovation is slowing down, especially for the mid-tier watches. Just look at the Instinct 3, which didn't get the new Elevate v5 sensors for ECG and skin temp readings, nor the Fenix 8's new UI or any kind of mapping support. It was a significant but safe upgrade over the Instinct 2.</p><p>The Forerunner 275 will clarify how Garmin's tiered system will work moving forward — whether Garmin continues to price-lock features that you'll see on much cheaper rival watches or not. The Forerunner 975 will show what Garmin has planned next to keep its core audience of serious runners and cyclists happy. Will it be flash or substance?</p>
<h2 id="what-i-expect-and-want-from-the-garmin-forerunner-975-2">What I expect (and want) from the Garmin Forerunner 975</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2853px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="q2UvRP3WhcrfhRvLSddMDf" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-elevation-profile.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 965 showing the elevation profile for a course" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q2UvRP3WhcrfhRvLSddMDf.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2853" height="1605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want the Forerunner 975 to be a mere Fenix 8-lite, but I'd certainly expect the 975 to get its Elevate v5 sensor suite, and Garmin may give it a flashlight, too. Maybe Garmin throws a mic and speaker in there, just to enable the same Bluetooth calling and offline voice assistant.</p><p>Otherwise, the Forerunner 975 should keep the titanium bezel on top of a light polymer body, and I'd be shocked if its AMOLED display gets any larger than 1.4 inches since even the Fenix 8 stopped there. Almost any other smartwatch at this price has sapphire glass, but I'd bet Garmin sticks to Gorilla Glass, unfortunately.</p><p>The Forerunner 965's 23-day battery life estimate is already excellent; the bigger priority for this generation would be increasing its SatiQ and multi-band GPS battery life above 22 and 19 hours, respectively.</p><p>I'm also curious if Garmin would debut a new GPS chipset or antenna design on the new Forerunners for better accuracy, but quite frankly, I'm already satisfied with the current tracking quality and think that might be overkill. But maybe Garmin will convince me otherwise.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZZgzPgvbFan2xA8RwGbPhA" name="garmin-forerunner-945-lte-3.jpg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner LTE, showing an option for Live Event Sharing via satellite" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZZgzPgvbFan2xA8RwGbPhA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first big request is that Garmin finally bring back LTE for the first time since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-forerunner-945-lte-review">Forerunner 945 LTE</a>. Better safety tracking is just the start. If Garmin does give it a mic, then you get cellular calls and the option to message folks via Explore and voice-to-text. And in theory, Garmin could enable music streaming if that's your thing. This could be an optional upgrade at launch for $50–100 more.</p><p>My second request is that Garmin sell both 47mm and 43mm 975 watches, so runners with smaller wrists can benefit from the perks the 275 lacks. This is one of the few complaints I had with the 965, even though I prefer a larger size.</p><p>Since Garmin gave the Fenix 8 leak-proof buttons, that could theoretically benefit the 975 as a triathlete's watch, making it better suited for the swimming portion of your races.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="saVs5xFzRFWuEhLLsVUrtJ" name="Garmin-Forerunner-965-endurance-score-chart.jpeg" alt="Endurance score on the Garmin Forerunner 965" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saVs5xFzRFWuEhLLsVUrtJ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm most interested in what kind of running or triathlete <em>software</em> Garmin could introduce or revamp.</p><p>The 965 has tools like chronic load, real-time stamina, endurance/ hill score, heat acclimation, and advanced cycling dynamics that you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-vs-265">don't get on the 265</a> — not to mention maps. These vary from vital to novelties for athletes, and I'm curious if Garmin has any other improvements up its sleeve that can live up to training status and readiness for usefulness.</p><p>If Garmin has map-layer or route improvements for hikers, that'd certainly make outdoorsy types happy; for me, I just want faster zooming in and out, which would require Garmin to put more effort into its processor.</p><p>For my personal pet peeves, I've already written about how Garmin should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">revamp the training load</a> so it splits out low/high aerobic and anaerobic portions based on time spent in each HR zone — not all to one category based on your HR average. I'd also like to be able to edit suggested workouts on the 965 based on how I'm feeling and to see my challenge progress on the watch, too. But that's more about nitpicking than finding a new "signature feature."</p>
<h2 id="the-garmin-forerunner-275-probably-won-t-rock-the-boat-2">The Garmin Forerunner 275 probably won't rock the boat</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3Hk9tqAw2vZYiRTAVT45y8" name="Garmin-Forerunner-265-acute-load.jpeg" alt="Acute load data on the Garmin Forerunner 265" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Hk9tqAw2vZYiRTAVT45y8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Forerunner 265 is an excellent running watch, but the main reason it's so useful is that Garmin artificially locks features like training load from the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>. With the Forerunner 275, you can expect it to keep its mid-tier placement while maybe adding a couple of 965 exclusives like Endurance score or Strava Live Segments to keep things fresh.</p><p>Still, Garmin will keep some perks locked to the 975. I'd be shocked if Garmin gives it any materials besides polymer, though maybe it could add an aluminum bezel like the Vivoactive 5. The 275 should have music storage by default but no mapping based on Garmin's choice with the Instinct 3. And maybe Garmin will stick with the Elevate v4 sensors on this model, too (though I hope they don't).</p><p>In terms of <em>flashy</em> new features to excite the journalists, I wonder if Garmin is watching rival brands adding "AI insights" and LLM coaching and considering a "Garmin Coach" rebrand to make it a chatbot that inputs your fitness data and explains features for beginner runners.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="L32utu6sJRhWEgUGUmhh8B" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-and-965.jpeg" alt="Garmin Forerunner 165 and 965 sitting atop one another on a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L32utu6sJRhWEgUGUmhh8B.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't necessarily <em>want</em> this and am pretty happy with the current Firstbeat Analytics and daily suggested workouts, but AI is a fact of our daily lives now, and Garmin shareholders may want them to look into this option to appear cutting-edge in the fitness space.</p><p>Overall, though, I think the Garmin Forerunner 275 and 975 constitute such an important launch for Garmin because things <em>do</em> feel a bit stale right now, particularly below the $1,000 tier. These watches will represent whether <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> still have some momentum in terms of innovation or if Garmin is starting to run out of fresh ideas.</p><p>But hey, if the Forerunner 975 and 275 are incremental upgrades, at least they can coast on the fact that their predecessors provide a fantastic foundation and already have most of the training tools you could ever want.</p>

Until now, developers could rely on either Vulkan or OpenGL, although the latter has been around for quite a long time.</p><p>This move to Vulkan as the default opens up a world of advanced rendering features for developers, such as ray tracing and multithreading. This can help enable richer, more immersive visuals for games that utilize it.</p><p>Normally, this isn't that I would care all that much about, as I usually have one of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones/">Android phones</a> running the latest software. However, the move to making Vulkan the default for graphics will kick in when the final version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16</a> arrives. That's an important point of distinction when you're deciding on what gaming handheld to pick up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RDB4PbQ8UCrcEm6vLb8VtH" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-3.jpg" alt="Echoes of Wisdom on the Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RDB4PbQ8UCrcEm6vLb8VtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With many of these handhelds, you won't find the latest version of Android at the helm. Instead, companies include anywhere between Android 11 and, on very rare occasions, Android 14. But most of the time, you're getting Android 13 with little to no hope of seeing newer versions.</p><p>Some of this can be attributed to compatibility, seeing as something like the Retroid Pocket 5 and its Snapdragon 865 is better suited for older versions of Android. At the same time, some, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/pimax-portal-review">Pimax Portal</a> and Retroid Pocket Mini, ship with Android 10. Pimax no longer sells the Portal, and although the Pocket Mini could be upgraded to Android 13, it comes with the caveat of a drop in performance.</p><p>This leads me to why I'm intrigued by Google's decision to switch to the Vulkan API. I doubt devices such as the Pocket Mini will ever even sniff <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, but that's using a six-year-old chip. However, it might be a different story with gaming handhelds like the AYN Odin 2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">AYANEO Pocket EVO</a>. The former utilizes the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, with the latter reliant upon the G3x Gen 2.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qfnqADbmRTzJ9t3DMQcvTR" name="ps3-on-android-3" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO and Gran Turismo via RPCS3 on Lenovo Legion Go S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qfnqADbmRTzJ9t3DMQcvTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, neither of these are the latest and greatest, but both are still quite performant. Not to mention that, in part, thanks to community driver support, they are even better for mobile gaming than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. There's hope that the community shifts its focus to try and unlock the horsepower of Qualcomm's latest chips, but that might not ever happen.</p><p>However, this is where I'm wondering if a (relatively) simple software update could provide even better performance and compatibility with newer chips. I'm not so sure that's what will happen, but I'm hopeful that at least <em>one</em> company will release an Android 16 update, even if it's just to see what happens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5" name="ayn-odin-2-tloz-tears-of-the-kingdom.jpg" alt="Tears of the Kingdom on AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWfBF4dBBJScbEVpV3QWF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is another side of the coin, and it's that some companies use a heavily skinned version of Android. In doing so, it's able to implement various tools that can take full advantage of the hardware.</p><p>AYANEO handhelds, for example, usually have a few extra buttons than even what you'll find on many controllers. Not only that, but when you start up something like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a> for the first time, you're not going to be greeted by the traditional Android home screen. Instead, it's a launcher unique to AYANEO handhelds, complete with a fly-out menu that provides more granular profile controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GCWKXHJ8w25DXD2JZgqccQ" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-6.jpg" alt="Side menu open on the Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GCWKXHJ8w25DXD2JZgqccQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, if you were to fire up a Retroid Pocket 5 for the first time, you're taken through a unique setup process that guides you through everything. And when everything is said and done, it's just your basic old Android home screen, giving you the freedom to install any custom launcher that you want. Or, just leave it as is if that's the way you want to roll.</p><p>Nevertheless, I'm still pretty excited to see what kind of effect Google's latest announcement has not just on gaming handhelds but also on phones and tablets. I think, in the long run, this will be good for everyone. I just hope that these gaming handheld OEMs don't end up kicking and screaming the entire time.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung usually does a good job with software updates, but that isn't the case with One UI 7. While most other manufacturers rolled out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based update to their flagships, Samsung is still on the beta channel, with a stable release slated for the month of April. To put things in context, Google plans to release <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> in June, so by the time the Android 15 update rolls out to most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Galaxy S24</a> models around the world, the next version of Android will be ready. <br><br>This isn't an issue with the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25</a> devices, which debuted with One UI 7. Samsung launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A36 and A56</a> in recent weeks, and the mid-range devices also run One UI 7 based on Android 15 out of the box, meaning they have the update ahead of the Galaxy S24, S24+, and S24 Ultra models. <br><br>In characteristic fashion, Samsung hasn't said why the update is taking so long, only noting that it has seven beta builds planned out. The interminable wait means last year's Galaxy S24 models will be the last flagships to make the switch to Android 15; Xiaomi has traditionally been the laggard in this regard, but even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-review">Xiaomi 14</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> got the stable Android 15-based update at the start of the year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa" name="oxygenos-15-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kersukxmGC4L8iY6McykXa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like Google and Honor, Samsung guarantees seven years of Android updates to its flagships, but the fact that the update isn't available six months after the debut of the stable Android 15 build is worrisome. Unlike recent releases, One UI 7 has plenty of new features, including the Now Bar and Now Brief, even more AI utilities, and a cleaner visual design that's been a long time coming. <br><br>Of course, all the new additions are meaningless if it takes Samsung this long to roll out the update to its phones, and it's interesting to see how Chinese manufacturers are now doing a much better job in this regard. OnePlus, for instance, delivered the stable Android 15 update to its phones back in October, and it was followed by OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi, who started their updates at the end of the year. <br><br>The lengthy wait combined with the accelerated release of Android 16 means Samsung has to scramble to deliver these updates to its older phones. And talking about the Galaxy A56, while the brand didn't change too much with the device (yet again), the phone could be a decent choice if you need a mid-ranger in the U.S., where most Chinese manufacturers don't sell their products. This isn't the case outside the country, as even budget phones like the Nothing Phone 3a Pro are a much better choice. <br><br>Ultimately, it's the Galaxy A models that contribute to Samsung's bottom line in a more meaningful way than the Galaxy S series, so it is understandable that the brand is turning its attention to releasing new models instead of delivering updates to its older phones.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Before I was an Android user, I used to be really into Windows Phone. Back then, Nokia was already doing some pretty great things with smartphone cameras, from the Symbian-powered Nokia N8 (which I owned) and 808 Pureview to the Nokia Lumia 1020 running Windows Phone. Back in 2012, a 41MP camera was pretty wild, and Nokia was using the sensor in a way not commonly seen on a smartphone, making it a pretty big deal.</p><p>While I've had several Lumia phones (I still have my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/lumia-950-review">Lumia 950</a>), I never owned the 1020. So when my friend recently gave me his, I decided it was the perfect opportunity to take it for a spin to see just how well the camera has held up over the years. And since it's been 12 years since it launched, I decided to compare the Lumia to my current favorite device in Android imaging, the OnePlus 12.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-the-lumia-1020-and-oneplus-12-2">Comparing the Lumia 1020 and OnePlus 12</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3861px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y8EBCGAebC9oFMGjy3xoV5" name="Nokia-Lumia-1020-and-OnePlus-12" alt="Derrek Lee holding the Lumia 1020 and OnePlus 12 in both hands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8EBCGAebC9oFMGjy3xoV5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3861" height="2172" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/nokia-lumia-1020-review">Lumia 1020</a> only features one rear camera, with a total resolution of 41MP and a total usable resolution of 38MP. By comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-camera-impressions-why-it-replaced-my-pixel-9">OnePlus 12 camera setup</a> consists of three rear sensors, including a 50MP primary sensor, a 64MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, and a 48MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>While the Lumia 1020 is limited by its single camera lens, it has a unique way of capturing images for the time, letting users simultaneously capture a 5MP image and a full-resolution 38MP image. Using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-pixel-binning-works-smartphone-cameras">pixel binning</a>, the phone is able to achieve "lossless" zoom while retaining the 5MP resolution while still taking a second full-resolution image even when zoomed in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="9AreY39Coj6nd2edJ95Lik" name="Nokia-Lumia-1020-camera-settings" alt="Lumia 1020 camera settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9AreY39Coj6nd2edJ95Lik.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="768" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The idea with the Lumia 1020 is that you can zoom in while taking the photo, or you can take the full-resolution image and "reframe" it later to get essentially the same quality. However, aside from only having one sensor, therefore lacking any optical zoom and the ability to take ultrawide shots, the Lumia 1020 is limited to roughly 3x zoom, which is still "lossless," meaning you'll get a 5MP image regardless.</p><p>Meanwhile, the telephoto lens on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> not only provides optical zoom at 3x but can also provide up to 6x of in-sensor zoom while maintaining image quality.</p><p>That said, I decided to keep zoom levels at 3x to see how the Lumia 1020 fared against the dedicated telephoto lens of the OnePlus 12. I also captured both the zoomed 5MP image and full-resolution 38MP image together.</p>
<h2 id="the-results-2">The results</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aXhAmh8YPh5gxYmLHrudok" name="Nokia-Lumia-1020-camera" alt="Lumia 1020 camera housing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aXhAmh8YPh5gxYmLHrudok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3264" height="1836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing worth noting is that at first glance, there's not much difference between the Lumia 1020's 5MP image and 38MP image when taking unzoomed images or even when cropping in later at the same relative zoom distance on the full-resolution shot. The difference in quality would only show up if you zoomed into the 5MP image and 38MP image after the fact, with the latter retaining more quality at 100% zoom.</p>

<p>When comparing with the OnePlus 12, what's consistent across each of the photos is that OnePlus handles various lighting conditions much better than the Lumia 1020. That goes for exposure, color saturation, and even noise, all of which hinder the Lumia's images in one way or another. This is sort of to be expected given how old this phone is, although the Lumia still manages to produce respectable photos if there's good lighting.</p><p>Just don't try to take photos at night, as the Lumia camera will suffer, even with pixel binning and the built-in optical image stabilization.</p>

<p>While taking photos, I struggled a lot with the response time of the Lumia 1020. Opening the camera app takes about 3-4 seconds, even when using the dedicated camera button. Not only that, but actually capturing a photo can take a couple of seconds as the camera finds its focus. Still, I will sometimes find myself surprised with just how well the shutter speed is able to capture moving objects, despite how much work the Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 is doing to take and process the image.</p><p>You can see below how the phone was able to nicely capture the birds flying around, with the wings kept fairly in focus. The scene itself was a bit chaotic, but both phones weren't too phased by all the movement. Even some of today's best Android phones would struggle with all the flapping wings (looking at you, Samsung).</p>

<h2 id="how-far-we-ve-come-2">How far we've come</h2>
<p>What I realized while testing the Lumia 1020 was that while it was doing some impressive things in 2012, camera technology has come a long way in smartphones. Not only are phones now equipped with multiple lenses to achieve things like wider photos or better zoom, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best Android camera phones</a> (and even not-so-good ones) often employ some of the same techniques that the Lumia was using even back then, only better.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> have taken smartphone photography to some impressive heights, giving us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/replacing-my-dslr-with-vivo-x100-pro">near-DSLR quality</a> and allowing anyone to take impressive photos with a tap of a button. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, with its massive 200MP camera and quad-camera setup, does a great job of giving users a very versatile and accessible camera system to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">rival its closest competitors</a> like the iPhone.</p><p>The Lumia 1020 was quite a marvel for its time, and I would have loved to own one back when it first launched. But having one now makes me really appreciate just how far we've come with smartphone photography.</p>

Or maybe the universal appeal of something like WhatsApp will have won us over. Either way, both companies will stay hard at work, telling you why their service is superior and why the other is sub-par.</p><p>That's because this was never about encryption, or even RCS, for Apple and Google. It was about locking you in with their platform.</p>

<p>We don't need <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-the-real-reason-imessage-isnt-available-android">email evidence</a> discovered at a trial to know this, but we have it, and it pretty much says that Apple (in this case) will do whatever it takes to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/rcs-vs-sms-vs-imessage-whats-difference">iMessage</a> to keep people from buying an Android. Google will do the same; its messaging service doesn't offer anything you couldn't find on an iPhone, but there are plenty of other software services Google offers to try and convince you to stay.</p><p>Staying is important for both companies. Apple is a business that makes money from selling you goods and services. What it offers is so well-regarded that it can charge too much, and people are still willing to buy it. You get what you pay for and all that.</p><p>Google doesn't charge for Android, but Android is a pathway to your eyeballs. Google services on an Android phone are a big part of Google's core business model, and the more people they can garner, the more money they stand to make.</p><p>For both companies, numbers are important to the bottom line.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Both Apple and Google want you to stay on their platforms and will do what it takes to keep you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The real question is, what will Apple and Google bake into their respective messaging apps to fan the flames now that encryption isn't the issue? This could mean some awesome new features that integrate messaging with other apps and services, or it could mean something nobody seems to appreciate, like a new set of stickers.</p><p>Tight integration with a service like YouTube could make for an interesting messages app as long as it's done well — and you're able to opt out. Messages could be a reimagined <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-google-and-why-should-i-use-it">Google Plus</a> that people actually <em>want</em> to use.</p><p>Apple, too, can find new ways to integrate its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-apple-can-learn-about-ai" target="_blank">AI services</a> with iMessage, and iOS users will flock to try it. If it works well, they'll keep using it.</p><p>One thing is certain: neither company is going to give up on trying to tell you why you want and need to use its stuff or how the other is behind the times.</p>

CAD renders of the alleged Pixel 10 trio surfaced online with so much clarity that we thought it was the real deal. The renders were shared by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank">OnLeaks</a>, revealing all the design and hardware of the device.</p><p>According to the tipster, not much could change in the next-gen Pixel. That said, it seems like the base model renders add an extra lens, giving it a triple camera array. Meanwhile, the other two models will stick to the same design with no significant hardware changes. However, the devices could obviously see some internal and software upgrades, including the new and powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> chip.</p><p>We are hoping to catch a glimpse of the next flagship at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-2022-preview">Google I/O event.</a> While we wait, here's a look at what we'd wish to see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>.</p>

In a press release, the company said that Android 16 Beta 3 has reached the "Platform Stability" stage and that this will be available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">enrolled users, including those with Pixels</a>.</p><p>This beta version is bringing a new accessibility tool for those with low vision. To help these users, the OS will outline text and change the background color of the text box, making the text pop and increasing legibility. Next is "Local Network Protection," which will essentially act as a gatekeeper for home devices. It will seek permission when an app tries to access/connect to devices like printers, smart TVs, or any other gadget that shares your Wi-Fi or Data — giving more control to the user.</p><p>Along with the above features, Google is finally bringing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>" support to Pixels, which allows audio to be broadcast from one source to several others.

Although it's not available to buy (yet), it is meant to be a "visionary glimpse" of what the company has in store for the future.</p><p>Unlike Huawei's large tri-fold phone, which looks like a Galaxy Z Fold with an extra flap, the Infinix Zero Mini concept is a small-scale tri-fold phone. It's more like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus</a> unfolding sideways. The idea is tantalizingly fun and pregnant with possibilities.</p><p>There aren't many images of the Infinix Zero Mini, but the available renders provide insight into how the concept could be used in the real world.</p><p>Believe it or not, I'm more excited by the Infinix tri-fold than Huawei — or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/who-would-buy-a-samsung-galaxy-g-fold-multi-foldable-phone">Samsung's rumored take</a> on a tri-foldable device.</p>
<h2 id="my-woes-with-the-huawei-mate-xt-2">My woes with the Huawei Mate XT</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uxXRHZUDqc8RXw9JWFUXtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Huawei Mate XT Ultimate has a tablet-sized 10.2-inch OLED panel that you can take anywhere. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before calling me crazy, hear me out. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is undoubtedly a gorgeous device. It's the pinnacle of innovation and definitely one of the most exciting phones we've seen in a long time.</p><p>I live in Southeast Asia, so it's actually possible for me to walk into a store and purchase one; the North American market doesn't have that option. The problem is, though, that innovation is expensive.</p><p>In my locale, the Mate XT is priced at RM14,999, which is about $3,372 when converted to USD. Even if I dared to dream about owning one, I'd have to consider selling one of my kidneys. To be fully candid, that's the amount I spent to purchase my car.</p><p>In fact, almost all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are steeply priced. But Huawei has given us the most expensive folding phone the world has ever seen.</p><p>So yes, even though the Mate XT is a marvel of this technological era, and I do find it invigorating, the device has an unrealistic appeal. I can't afford to buy it, and even if I could, I don't imagine myself shelling out that much dough for a phone. Heck, I'd rather buy another car with that amount!</p>
<h2 id="not-all-foldables-will-bankrupt-you-2">Not all foldables will bankrupt you</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zoszeTXpaSAbu7hGunnY9D" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-09.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoszeTXpaSAbu7hGunnY9D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4139" height="2328" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The TECNO Phantom V Flip 2, an affordable flip phone for the rest of the world </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to put a damper on your enthusiasm. Feats such as the one Huawei achieved should be celebrated. And if you're a person with that much spare cash to burn, by all means, you should get the device. It's an absolutely lovely piece of technology.</p><p>As for myself, I've turned my gaze towards more humble brands such as Infinix and TECNO because they feel more realistically accessible. Also, Motorola doesn't sell foldables in my region despite selling some attractive, low-priced flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. I think Infinix can actually bring the concept tri-fold to life — and sell it at a more easily digestible price.</p><p>It feels like yesterday when TECNO first debuted the impossibly affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">Phantom V Flip</a>. I was stunned when the $600 price was revealed, and then impressed when the brand did it again with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a>.</p><p>Here's a little-known fact: Infinix and TECNO are both owned by smartphone manufacturer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://transsion.com/en">Transsion Holdings</a>, much like BBK Electronics owns OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, and Realme. This means that the sister brands most probably have access to each other's research and development.</p><p>This leads me to believe that if TECNO can do it, so can Infinix. The tri-fold might not be as cheap as the $700 Phantom V Flip 2, but it'll definitely be a whole lot cheaper than the $3,300 Huawei Mate XT.</p><p>And this is the main reason why the Infinix Zero Mini tri-fold, to me, is a lot more exciting.</p>

The main camera takes unbelievable images and videos, and the 200MP telephoto at the back is the best you'll find today.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xKgyTrqMuDTLZWEmqZHB93" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xKgyTrqMuDTLZWEmqZHB93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO was onto a good thing with the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, with a dual-tone color scheme and leather back making the device stand out quite a bit. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, however, doesn't quite have that same flair, with the device switching to a flat profile, and featuring a plain back with a silky texture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vX79YX2pn2DeFud8ccjt63" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vX79YX2pn2DeFud8ccjt63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It still looks good, but I don't like the design as much as its predecessors, considering the Find X3 Pro, Find X5 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a> all had attention-grabbing backs. Although the design isn't quite as striking, the device is great to hold and use, and the design of the camera housing is cleaner, and the module itself doesn't protrude as much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9bbv9XSGRWXxXTZZRKwtt" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bbv9XSGRWXxXTZZRKwtt.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By contrast, Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> has a much more elegant design this time than previous years. The grey model looks great in its own right, but if you're interested in this phone, I highly recommend getting the blue option — it looks absolutely incredible. The X200 Pro is thicker and 13g heavier than the Find X8 Pro, and if anything, I like the in-hand feel of the device better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b5F5Af4eqZSAxz7gsP9wH3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5F5Af4eqZSAxz7gsP9wH3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both phones have flat sides, they have beveled edges that make it easier to hold the devices. The X200 Pro has a sizeable camera module at the back, but even then, it has better weight distribution, and I like the added heft. Vivo uses the best ultrasonic modules on its phones, and that's no different on the X200 Pro — it is fast to unlock and doesn't have any issues even with oily or wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aHLD7Hu3ZREWtMUaVhgoJ3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aHLD7Hu3ZREWtMUaVhgoJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones get IP68 alongside the new IP69 ingress protection, and the Find X8 Pro has the alert slider on the left, making it easy to switch between ring, vibrate, and silent modes. Overall, these are two of the best phones of 2025, and while they both look good, I much prefer the styling of the X200 Pro.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-pro-vs-vivo-x200-pro-panel-2">OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro: Panel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="j2uEZVoxPgUsCpYnRnZTA3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2uEZVoxPgUsCpYnRnZTA3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones have similar-sized 6.78-inch AMOLED panels, and they go up to 4500 nits. You get all the extras: 120Hz refresh, Dolby Vision and HDR10+, Ultra HDR, and extensive customizability when adjusting the color balance. As you'd imagine in this category, both devices hold up incredibly well, and there are no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AHHBj6qHTCAjKNNnegjG33" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHHBj6qHTCAjKNNnegjG33.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the X200 Pro gets brighter outdoors and in regular use. In fact, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a brighter panel, and the X200 Pro comes in at a close second. The Find X8 Pro doesn't have any shortcomings either, but it doesn't get quite as bright. There's good stereo sound on both devices, and it's adequate if you're just gaming casually.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8KPXfk2sWEpRK6Hjf57n83" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8KPXfk2sWEpRK6Hjf57n83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the Find X8 Pro still limits most games to 60fps, and it is annoying considering the MediaTek platform doesn't have any issues pushing high framerates even in demanding titles. The X200 Pro is better in this regard, and in general, I prefer its color calibration out of the box. OPPO chose Gorilla Glass 7i this time, with Vivo using a custom solution; both phones hold up well to tumbles, and I thankfully didn't see any problems.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-pro-vs-vivo-x200-pro-hardware-2">OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SqhhLcBRF6uw5ZVBmfAi83" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SqhhLcBRF6uw5ZVBmfAi83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much to differentiate either device when it comes to the hardware. Both phones are powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400, and they're just as fast as their Qualcomm-powered rivals, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. They do a fantastic job with gaming as well, and the only issue I have is that the Find X8 Pro doesn't enable 120fps gaming although it can easily do so. <br><br>Outside of that, there are no problems whatsoever. Both phones play demanding games with relative ease, and I got stable framerates without any lag or jitter. There wasn't much in the way of overheating either, and this is where MediaTek has an advantage over Qualcomm this year — all the Qualcomm-based phones run hotter while running the same games.</p>

<p>Connectivity is rock-solid on either device, and they both get a good vibration motor that delivers granular feedback while using the keyboard and navigating the interface. Basically, there just isn't anything to fault when it comes to the internals on either device, and it's clear that the switch to MediaTek was absolutely the right move this year. <br><br>Talking about getting things right, both phones have massive batteries, and they last a day and a half on average. The Find X8 Pro gets a 5910mAh battery, with the X200 Pro packing a 6000mAh unit. Both devices leverage silicon battery tech to great effect, delivering increased density and longevity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4ocPAyjSsMxEvnRaJZCqx" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4ocPAyjSsMxEvnRaJZCqx.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the X200 Pro is the best phone I used this year. There isn't another device that lasts as long, and even with heavy use, I got over a day's use. The Find X8 Pro is a close second, and it also lasts over a day, but the battery life is a smidgen lower than the X200 Pro. <br><br>The Find X8 Pro gets 80W charging, but what I like is that it goes up to 50W over USB PD, and it makes charging the device with a regular GaN charger effortless. The X200 Pro uses Vivo's custom charging protocol and goes up to 90W, and either device takes just 50 minutes to charge the battery.</p>

<p>Make no mistake; these are two of the best cameras of 2025. In fact, the X200 Pro is my favorite camera phone of the year, and although it isn't the Ultra, it delivers truly outstanding photos and videos in any situation. I like what Vivo is doing with its camera tuning; the brand has a clear advantage over its Chinese rivals in this area, and that is evident when using the X200 Pro next to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and Magic 7 Pro.</p>

<p>The Find X8 Pro is almost as good, and I like the latest iteration of Hasselblad's image tuning algorithms. The phone has a quartet of 50MP cameras at the back, with dual tele lenses — one at 3x and the other at 6x — alongside a wide-angle and the main lens. The X200 Pro has a single tele lens, but it is using the new 200MP Samsung HP9 module, and it is incredible.</p>

<p>Both devices excel in challenging situations, and there really isn't much to critique when it comes to the resultant imagery. They both do a standout job with still photos and videos, and the X200 Pro in particular takes gorgeous portrait shots via the tele lens. Notably, both phones hold their own against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and I'm excited to see what the Find X8 Ultra and Vivo X200 Ultra have to deliver later this year.</p>

<p>Just like the internals, there isn't much to differentiate either device on the software side of things. They both run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and have customized skins that should be familiar if you've used either brand's devices in the past. I don't quite like the visual changes in ColorOS 15, and it is getting a bit too similar to iOS. <br><br>If anything, I like Funtouch OS better; while it still has overt styling, it is fluid, and there's extensive customizability. Both devices will get four Android OS updates, and while that isn't as much as what Google, Samsung and Honor deliver, it should be adequate.</p>

<p>I used the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro extensively at the end of 2024 and over the course of 2025, and they share a lot of similarities: they both have excellent cameras, great battery life, standout hardware, and software with plenty of customizability. Choosing between the two is a matter of preference; the X200 Pro does a better job with portrait shots, and the Find X8 Pro has better software features. <br><br>I enjoyed using the X200 Pro more in general; the design is better than the Find X8 Pro, the panel gets brighter, and the battery lasts a little longer. Both phones take great photos, but the new 200MP tele lens gives the X200 Pro an edge, and I like Vivo's camera tuning better. If I had to pick a winner, the X200 Pro gets my vote. <br><br>That said, the phone isn't available outside Asia, so if you're in the U.K. or need to use one of these devices in the west, the Find X8 Pro is the obvious choice as OPPO is back to selling phones in the region. But if you're in a country where the X200 Pro is available, I'd suggest picking it up — it is better than anything Google and Samsung have to offer, and you'll need to use the cameras to understand just how amazing it is.</p>

<hr>
<p>Android 16 Beta 3 just rolled out yesterday, while not many features were announced with this Beta, Google says Android 16 has reached "Platform stability."</p><p>Additionally, it seems like another important feature could be in the works. A deep dive into the third beta revealed several strings of code that showcased "summarized notifications," a feature that Google is working on bringing with Android 16 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-notification-summaries-3533720/">as first spotted by Android Authority</a>).</p><p>This feature will "automatically summarize conversation on apps," the publication added. Ring a bell? Apple has a similar feature that debuted with Apple Intelligence, but it didn't go the way it was supposed to. It provided<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/"> "Bizarre summaries," </a>leading Apple to pause this feature until further notice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C4pSK9o6bnCVTT6ucXUej8" name="Notification_summaries_in_Android_16" alt="Notifications summaries page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4pSK9o6bnCVTT6ucXUej8.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The strings within the third Beta showcased a new page for notification summaries. This will be housed in the existing notification history with the notification bundle options under <strong>Settings > Notifications</strong>, the publication further added. Within the page, you can toggle to enable the feature, labeled “<strong>use notification summaries</strong>.” The subsequent code string also mentions Conversation summaries, which isn't a new concept for Android users.</p><p>What's more interesting is that you can also pick which apps will use this feature and probably exclude the ones that you don't need it for. However, this could also mean that the new OS will have the capability to summarize only conversations, not notifications from other non-messaging apps." We've seen something similar with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/heres-how-android-autos-message-summary-feature-shortens-texts-with-ai">Android Auto</a>, which can use artificial intelligence to create summaries for longer messages.</p><p>The publication further notes that these summaries could use the Android System Intelligence app, rather than Gemini to help with this feature. That said, it seems like an exciting feature to look forward to, as the public launch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">Android 16</a> is closing in.</p>

We like the 2024 version of this phone a lot, especially for the 120Hz, 6.7-inch pOLED screen, the vegan leather backing, long battery life, and, of course, the inclusion of a built-in stylus. At this extra-low price point, this phone also punches well above its weight, featuring smooth, quick performance, and a generally more premium feel than most of what you can get for under $300.</p>

<p>CUKTECH isn't a name I've heard of before, but the brand's hefty battery pack put it on my radar. The recently released CUKTECH 30 140W Power Bank packs a whopping 40,000mAh of power and a total power output of 300W.</p><p>The CUKTECH 30 is ideal for long drives but not trips over the air, since you can't carry power banks over 20,000mAh inside most airlines. You wouldn't want to lug such a weighty battery around in a plane, so there's no love lost in that regard.</p><p>Speaking of weight, this thing is outrageously heavy for something "portable" that's meant to travel with you. Coming in at more than a kilo, it makes sense why CUKTECH decided to add a bucket-style handle to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">high-capacity power bank</a>. The logistics of it require a handle at the very least.</p>

<p>The CUKTECH 30 is relatively compact for such a high capacity power station. You'll find four ports on the front of the cube as well as a Qi wireless charging pad on top, a digital display on the front, and a power button beneath the screen. The display showcases power input and output details as well as the battery percentage.</p><p>Here are the power ratings and other specifications of the 40,000mAh power bank.</p>

<p>Both USB-C ports support PowerDelivery 3.1 and can be used for power input as well as output. You can also charge the CUKTECH 30 itself while simultaneously using the power bank to top up other devices.</p><p>I love it when charging tech brands like Anker and UGREEN include a power distribution charge. This helps you understand the charging speed of each port depending on how many are in use and which ones.</p>

<p>CUKTECH provides four charts to simplify the matter, just like major competing brands, and I really appreciate it. As you can see above, the charts tell you exactly what charging speed can be achieved from each of the 40,000mAh power bank's ports.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual suspects, CUKTECH also went ahead and incorporated a huge cooling fan into the back of this cuboid battery pack. The power bank smartly regulates the temperature of the charging accessory, so it never runs too hot.</p>

<p>If you know anything about chargers and cables, you'll know that charging over 100W requires a 5A cable, also known as an e-marked cable. CUKTECH provides a 5A 240W <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> in the box along with the battery pack, so you don't need to buy one in case you don't already own it.</p><p>The CUKTECH 30 is very handy for road trips and long-haul journeys. No matter how long your car charger's cable, having a separate power source in the back eliminates that tangled web of wires extending to the back. With such a large capacity, you can charge a 5,000mAh phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> a whopping <strong>eight times</strong>!</p><p>Ultimately, the CUKTECH 30 140W Power Bank is an all-inclusive purchase. The brand uses vehicle-grade batteries, so it's extremely safe to transport in your automobile. And, if you're getting robbed, you could kill the perpetrator by lobbing it at their noggin (just kidding, please don't try this at home).</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 14), reports announce Apple will move forward with a security improvement for its RCS messaging with Android devices.</p><p>It was announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-encryption-a-leap-towards-secure-and-interoperable-messaging/">GSMA press release</a> that the RCS standard will soon roll out E2EE (end-to-end encryption) measures for RCS messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629620/apple-iphone-e2ee-encryption-rcs-messaging-android">The Verge</a>). GSMA's technical director, Tom Van Pelt, states this update will ensure that messages and files, such as those you'd like to remain confidential, stay secure between the parties involved in the messaging instance.</p><p>Van Pelt adds this update means the RCS standard will be "the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers."</p><p>GSMA says its RCS Universal Profile 3.0 update will not only bring more security to users' messages but also protections against instances of fraud and scams. The Association states it will "continue to support" functions between iOS and Android, like group messaging, high-resolution media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators.</p><p>However, this update means Apple's iPhones should finally have encrypted texts between them and Android. In a statement to The Verge, Shane Bauer, an Apple spokesperson, informed the publication that it will "add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”</p>

<p>Apple is said to have been a strong advocate for E2EE in RCS alongside GSMA's work with "mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers." The company even stated it has "helped lead a cross-industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile," per The Verge.</p><p>There's a long history <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">of Google campaigning</a> for Apple to bring RCS support so Android can better communicate with iPhone owners. When an EU investigation into whether or not Apple's iMessage fell within "Gatekeeper" status, the company went ahead and announced it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">would bring RCS anyway</a>.</p><p>iOS 18 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">brought RCS support</a> between iPhones and Android nearly a year later. The update improved media sharing between users and most of what the GSMA discussed in its press release. However, the rollout lacked something substantial: encryption. What's of importance is that the RCS standard never <em>actually </em>had E2EE wrapped inside. It was Google that decided to add that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">strong level of encryption</a> for user messages.</p><p>When Apple worked to bring RCS, it didn't choose to work on encryption itself — and it surely didn't collaborate with Google to do it. Instead, we've got its collaboration with the GSM Association, as well as other companies to bring E2EE to the RCS standard as a whole.</p><p>Apple is set to bring the security measure to its iOS users soon, but how soon is still up in the air.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new patch for the Find My Device app that brings a new "People" tab beside "Devices."</li><li>The tab lets users quickly share their location, similar to Google Maps, with contacts, showing battery percentage and name.</li><li>Google highlighted such a feature during its March feature drop announcement and it's finally starting to appear for Android users two weeks later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Find My Device is picking up a couple of updates to end the week, but the most important is starting as test users can get in on.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/13/find-my-device-people-update/#more-665109">9to5Google</a>, the company is currently pushing update v3.1.277-4 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Find My Device</a> today (Mar 14). The core of this patch is the new "People" tab, which is a new location-sharing feature that users can try out. Nestled right beside the "Devices" tab at the bottom of the UI, users can quickly add someone they'd like to share their location with.</p><p>The UI to add someone shows an "in-app sharing" container. From there, users can tap someone they know or search for them if the app didn't make them readily available. However, above that, users will see a small card of what the other person will see once you've shared your location. It seems Google is making your profile icon, name, location (of course), and battery available to the person you've shared with.</p><p>Users can go about sharing their location by tapping the share button or grabbing a share link. Additionally, you can decide how long you'd like that other person to see your location. The publication states Google gives users the following options: one hour, "Today Only," "Until you turn this off," or a custom duration.</p><p>Google's People tab is powered by Maps, which makes sense considering it's extremely similar to what you'd find over there. More importantly, the People tab has a "beta" tag right beside it. It's likely Google is still working through issues and will continue to improve upon it as users deliver feedback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:227.27%;"><img id="j7fakYtZhxxT2efJ4HTnyk" name="google-find-my-device-people-tab-location-sharing" alt="Google's latest Find My Device update brings a new "People" tab for location sharing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7fakYtZhxxT2efJ4HTnyk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="264" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is rolling out, so users should begin seeing it today and in the days ahead. It also contains one minor change to the "Devices" tab, which produces it in a split-screen view, instead of a full page. Now, users can still see their devices on the map while browsing their inventory.</p><p>Google first brought attention to this "People" tab update during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March feature drop</a> for Pixels almost two weeks ago. The company stated users can share where they are with "trusted contacts," and that point can be viewed on a map on their phone or tablet. All Android users <em>should </em>see this update, though.</p><p>Google started pushing its Find My Device network out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">to more users and devices</a> in May 2024. Those in the U.S., U.K., and Japan were among the first to start noticing its features. Users can leverage the Find My Device network to relocate missing items like their phones and accessories, such as earbuds. Unlike most other phones, Google's Pixel 8 — and the Pixel 9 — benefit from its offline discovery mode, which lets you relocate the phones if they've lost power or have been shut down.</p><p>The Find My Device network will also alert you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-security-safety-improvements">an unwanted tracker</a> you didn't know was on you.</p>

<p>Google Assistant is running on borrowed time as the tech giant announced today (Mar. 14) that it will slowly start replacing Google Assistant with Gemini. Google Assistant has been around since 2016, and we've all gotten used to saying "Hey Google" for a better part of a decade now.  However, this switch is something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-becomes-gemini-but-only-in-certain-countries">has been on the cards</a> for several months now.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/looks-like-a-new-wake-word-could-be-replacing-hey-google"> Recent rumors</a> even indicated a new wake word in the works, so it feels like we did see this coming.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/">Keyword post</a>, the company stated that they will be upgrading Google Assistant with Gemini, "offering a new kind of help only possible with the power of AI." The upgrade is said to take personalization to a whole new level since Gemini will be able to interact with other apps on the phone to understand the user's choices better.</p>

<p>Google says that millions of users have switched from using Google Assistant to Gemini. That said, no longer having to choose between Gemini and Assistant could be a step in the right direction, especially as Google has been working to improve Gemini's capabilities and bring over Assistant features.</p><p>While we don't know when this will be put into motion for users at large, the company hinted at the fact that most devices will end up having Gemini instead of Google Assistant by the end of 2025.</p><p>"Over the coming months, we’re upgrading more users on mobile devices from Google Assistant to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/assistant/" target="_blank">Gemini</a>," the company stated in the Keyword. With that, later this year, users will no longer be able to download Google Assistant from their mobile app stores since it will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Not just phones but all the other devices that use Assistant will also be upgraded to AI-powered Gemini. The company will be bringing this shift to its line of wearables and home devices like headphones, watches,  speakers, and TVs. We assume that this will be rolled out in phases over the next few months, until then Google Assistant will continue to live on devices and run as usual.</p><p>Lastly, Google says that "it is just getting started" with this Gemini integration. Once Gemini replaces Assistant, the company will bring features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/made-by-google-gemini-ai-updates/">Gemini Live and </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en" target="_blank">Deep Research</a>, which will help transform Gemini into "a personal research assistant."</p><p>However, it is important to note that Google Assistant will continue to work as usual for phones that can't run Gemini.</p>
