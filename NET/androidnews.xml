This update fixes that with smooth left-right swiping.</li><li>You’ll also get a quick-access bar to react or comment without breaking your flow.</li></ul><hr><p>Google appears to be cooking up a Messages update in beta that makes it way easier to reply to photos and videos, and it could be perfect for those meme-packed, media-heavy chats.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-media-replies-swiping-3564243/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> in the latest Messages beta, Google is apparently testing a swipe feature that lets you zip through all shared pictures and videos in a chat. It’s a simple move that could seriously level up scrolling through media in busy group chats.</p><p>At present, you can react or reply to photos and videos in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, but every time you do that with another media, it kicks you back to the main chat. This feels a bit annoying when you're trying to go through a bunch of media at once.</p><p>This new way of viewing media is about to address this shortcoming. Instead of leaving one photo and hunting through the chat for the next, you’ll just swipe left or right to flip through recent or older pictures. Plus, a handy bar at the bottom lets you drop comments or reactions without missing a beat.</p><p>Android Authority managed to get this feature up and running and even shared a demo to show how it works in real life.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uboynFivFTc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><h2 id="lost-media-no-more-digging-2">Lost media? No more digging</h2><p>While swiping through media is a bit more helpful, it won’t cut it for digging up older stuff. That’s why Google is adding a dedicated media overview you can find in the chat details. Tap the new “Images” section, and you’ll get a neat timeline of every photo and video shared, kind of like what you see in some of our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a>, such as WhatsApp.</p><p>These tweaks might seem small to most, but if you’re always swapping pics and videos, they’ll make a big difference. And Google has been on this grind for a while—earlier this year, it was already testing threaded replies for media, so it’s clear Google wants to make Messages way better for handling visuals.</p><p>It’s still in the works, but it could drop for everyone in the next few months. Either way, it’s shaping up to be a solid upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Chargeasap is a new accessory manufacturer that's doing good things with charging tech. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/chargeasap-flash-pro-ultra-25000mah-275w-power-bank-that-does-it-all">tested the Flash Pro Ultra</a> a few weeks ago, and the 25,000mAh power bank held its own against Anker and UGREEN's offerings. The brand also sent over its GaN charger, and I've been using it for the better part of a month now.</p><p>The Zeus ticks all the right boxes: it has four charging ports in total, going up to 140W individually and delivering a total power budget of 280W. That's considerably more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-pro-gan-chargers-launch">UGREEN Nexode Pro</a> I use while traveling, which hits 160W in total. Another feature I like is that the Zeus has a built-in panel that shows real-time charging details, and this is quite handy — I normally rely on USB-C cables with integrated power meters to see these details.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TKxccBWr5E8LeTmBYxrNKf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5121" height="2885" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The downside is the cost; the Zeus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger">retails for $219 in the U.S.</a>, and that's more than twice the cost of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVPB4PC">160W Nexode Pro</a>. Clearly, Chargeasap is positioning the additional features as a key selling point of the charger, and it has other niceties — you get a set of plugs in the box that allows the charger to double a global travel plug that can be used anywhere, and that brings much-needed versatility.</p><h2 id="the-zeus-has-unmatched-versatility-2">The Zeus has unmatched versatility</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcwZw6YyMBktHNQCJopYf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, this is an all-in-one GaN charger that works anywhere in the world, and with the higher power budget, you'll only need the Zeus to charge all of your devices on the go. On that note, the charger is smaller and lighter than most options in this category; a decent achievement considering you're not missing out on any features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5075px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/weaVod2egrMRdLtAUNGRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5075" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rectangular design is easily portable, and I like that the Zeus comes in a white color variant; far too many chargers are just sold in a grey or black color, and the white model stands out. Coming in at 320g, it doesn't weigh too much either, and you get a pouch that holds the travel plugs and the charger with relative ease.</p><h2 id="it-s-designed-to-charge-all-your-devices-at-once-2">It's designed to charge all your devices at once</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5134px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3W7N9jPsr7smaBdhznFRNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5134" height="2892" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to connectivity, the Zeus has a single USB-A port that goes up to 65W, and three USB-C ports. The main and secondary USB-C connectors hit 140W over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and the other port maxes out at 100W. What I like the most is the integrated OLED panel; it shows real-time charging info, and it makes all the difference if you're charging several devices at once — like I do all the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bAvaF5FRph2dxGCUvWYUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The charger has foldable blade plugs as standard, and you can slot in U.K., Australia, and an angled two pin connector if you're traveling. Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues with the Zeus in the month I used it. It tends to get a little hot when all ports are in use, but that is the case with all GaN chargers, and it doesn't overheat.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8wTyyDKHsRQ6J2ffvpTXUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The USB-C port handles PPS up to 65W, making it a good choice if you've got a Samsung device. Interestingly, the USB-A port has the VOOC charging protocol, but it's limited to 22.5W, and I was able to charge the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a> with relative ease. Of course, you can also use the regular USB-C PD connectivity with these devices now, but if you've got an older BBK phone, the Zeus is definitely handy.</p><h2 id="all-the-power-you-need-anywhere-you-want-it-2">All the power you need — anywhere you want it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f" name="Chargeasap Zeus" alt="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3eW9TLroiJtXNxPUtiwn8f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is that the Zeus is able to handle charging two 140W devices at the same time. That is a big deal, and it allows the charger to go up to 280W in total. This is the rundown of the power budget you get with the Zeus:</p><ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C3 out (100W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 4.5V/5A (22.5W), 5V/4.5A (22.5W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (280W max):</strong> 140W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-C3 (240W max): </strong>140W + 100W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 (270W max): </strong>140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (270W max):</strong> 140W + 65W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 + USB-A (255W max):</strong> 140W + 100W + 15W</li></ul><p>The charging potential is a key advantage, and I was able to use the Zeus with my Honor MagicBook Pro 16, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and over a dozen accessories without any issues. The charger delivered consistent power, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever in this regard.</p><p>To sum up, the extensive feature-set combined with 280W power budget means the Zeus is now my go-to choice as a travel GaN charger. It has all the accessories I need while traveling, and having an OLED panel lets me see how long it takes to charge all connected devices. It is on the costlier side, but you also get double the charging potential of most GaN chargers available today, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="242b11d8-98d6-4d4e-b2be-cf3de8fa92c8">            <a href="https://chargeasap.com/products/270w-zeus-charger" data-model-name="Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:102.95%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNGmon3jovSdW5wpZ9f6YX.jpg' alt="Chargeasap Zeus"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Chargeasap Zeus 280W GaN Charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With all the power you need and a portable design that works globally, the Zeus is one of the best GaN chargers you can buy today. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

But the clock is ticking on Samsung's "free" AI features. And at some point, Galaxy Watch owners may have to ask themselves whether they're willing to pay for the best version of Samsung Health.</p><p>It started last year when Samsung revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and wearable insights like Energy Score and AI-based Wellness Tips for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Watch 7</a>. It promised at the time that its AI tricks "will be provided for free until the end of 2025 on supported Samsung Galaxy devices."</p><p>At the January Unpacked, Samsung revealed a much longer list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">AI-based health features</a> coming this summer: Vascular Load tracking to determine daily "strain on your heart," a "personal health coach" for LLM-based "insights" for your health questions, an "antioxidant index" with "tailored meal plans and recipes," and mood check-ins.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.97%;"><img id="RRQnekYhcCfDoP7UzSmjtC" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Vascular-Load-example" alt="The Vascular load (Labs) submenu in Samsung Health that shows your heart's activity level from day to day, as well as a summary of the data: "Steady: Your vascular load is consistent.

And we can expect even more, based on this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-feature-runners-virtual-coach-guidance-rumor">recent leak</a> about a Samsung "Running Coach" that'll have you run for 12 minutes to judge your fitness baseline and then build a "personalized training plan" for you.</p><p>Additionally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 beta</a> introduced food log reminders and a "Together" feature that challenges your friends to match your weekly running distance.</p><p>Until we hear otherwise, all of this should be free for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> owners. I've been waiting for Samsung to pair its dual-band GPS accuracy with better running guidance and an equivalent to the training load info that Garmin, Apple, and Fitbit offer. That's why the Running Coach-Vascular Load combo sounds tantalizing.</p><p>My worry, though, is that this is all bait on the hook for an eventual Samsung subscription. I could easily see Samsung building up its stockpile of health tools before making a Fitbit Premium or Google One AI equivalent very soon.</p><h2 id="waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop-2">Waiting for the other shoe to drop</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-and-Watch-6-Classic" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (left) sitting atop the Galaxy Watch Ultra (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aicnph6WTXLfmFefVdmFdh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, we'd trust that Samsung simply wants to improve its app to make it more competitive against Apple Health, as a boon for people who pay for its products.

Garmin, in particular, held back on releasing new features so that it could shove them all into its subscription and mitigate profit losses from tariffs.</p><p>I'd guess Samsung is taking the reverse approach: It wants to hook us with free Galaxy AI perks, then throw them behind a paywall and deal with the blowback then. After all, it did <em>warn</em> us it would charge for AI eventually.</p><p>Perhaps I'm worrying over nothing, and we'll still receive free auto-generated nutrition plans, running plans, and the health coach's services even after 2025. However, Samsung will examine its health and AI competitors, which charge $10–20 per month, and see that its customers have few alternatives left to turn to.</p><p>If Samsung starts to paywall even some of these tools in 2026, it'll make the Samsung Health experience <em>very</em> different, closer to the free, watered-down version of Fitbit.</p><h2 id="would-you-pay-for-a-samsung-health-subscription-2">Would you pay for a Samsung Health subscription?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-running-together" alt="The Together feature in the Samsung Health app on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNFEsF8R8aG7BJUiZccGnK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe this speculation is premature. But when I saw that rumor about the Samsung Health Running Coach, exactly what I'd been waiting for, I had to remind myself to look this gift horse in the mouth before letting myself geek out. It's AI-generated, like the other new features.</p><p>I could see Samsung offering one overall Galaxy AI plan for all your devices, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Pro plan. Or else it could keep the phone AI subscription separate from the Samsung Health Coach subscription.</p><p>So let's assume that Samsung Health goes from a free app to a paywalled one sometime next year. Are you excited enough by AI coaching, nutrition, and health data that you'd pay for it after the free trial ended? Would you continue using Samsung Health but ignore the AI tricks entirely? Or would a paywall push you to look elsewhere for a different fitness app?</p> ]]></dc:content>

Because of the way Android is developed and distributed, you've always been able to build it yourself, to your own specifications.</p><p>Let's be honest, though; it was fun for some people, but traditionally it's been a pain in the ass that few people are able to do. Troubleshooting cryptic commands to build some software overnight that might not even work is something most people don't feel like even trying. I don't blame anyone; it can be a headache, no matter how fun you might find it.</p><p>The good news is that you don't have to do it yourself any longer, and companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-murena-one-is-pure-android-not-pure-google">Murena</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/eos-review-privacy-focused-android-without-google">e-foundation</a> are doing all the hard work for you. And you know what? They make a really damn good product, one I think everyone needs to check out for themselves, and it's called /e/OS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL" name="Murena-Fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Murena Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yB5aSK3ZTrZcPkks9nxJVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't hate Google. The company does a lot of things I don't like, but it also does a lot of things I do like. I choose to embrace Android for a reason: I think it's the best commercially available platform and offers the most choice, so the things you buy do what you want them to do.</p><p>When you take the best parts of Android and work to turn it into software built for users instead of financial gain, the results are amazing. With the release of /e/OS 3, it's reached the point where it's a good choice for everyone.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pVoaO6sFXZs" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>You have access to every feature you can think of that doesn't require a giant tech company to act as an overseer. Secure cloud backup? It's there. An intuitive interface that can be customized to work best for you? That's there, too.</p><p>So are all the apps you love because it's Android; you can even access a network tool to help you find your phone when you lose it, without Google or Apple shepherding how you're doing it. While the software has been more than usable for a while, the latest version takes the final step. It's as good or better than Google's Android or iOS.</p><p>There are two reasons why now is the perfect time to check out what /e/OS has to offer. First, and most important to a lot of us, is that you probably won't have to spend any money.</p><p>The software is designed to run really well on modest hardware (remember when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android was that way</a>?), so it will likely work with your last phone if you didn't trade it in for something new and shiny. It will even work well on phones as old as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-pixel-november-update-squashes-the-first-round-of-android-15-bugs">first Google Pixel</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-5-specs">OnePlus 5</a>. You can find a list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doc.e.foundation/devices" target="_blank">221 supported models here</a>, but if you do have a few dollars to spend, you can also buy it preloaded on phones from Murena and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1851px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT" name="e-os-3-smartphone" alt="/e/OS 3 on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUCSaY8eKAjJMzgxZsQBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1851" height="1041" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also trust the software, much more than you can trust anything else. I'm not saying you shouldn't trust Google, Apple, or Samsung, but /e/OS is 100% open-source, and an entire development community pores through the code to make sure it does exactly what it is advertised to do. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>A good portion of Android is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp" target="_blank">still that way</a>, but much of what you'll find in a new phone comes from Google or the company that made it, and they aren't sharing how it works. To know exactly what a Google Pixel can do, you have to either be part of the development team or trust the development team.</p><p>To know exactly what an /e/OS phone can do, you simply need to read what is made freely available to everyone. No marketing team or sales division is acting as a middleman between you and what you want to know.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1678px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.63%;"><img id="4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA" name="AOSP.jpg" alt="AOSP" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4nWrBwRHNS8YAn5VeyQRkA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1678" height="967" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Trying it is easy, too. You will need a computer with sufficient space to download the installer and files themselves; the process is straightforward. Make sure your phone is up to date, works, and has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-android-auto">USB cable</a> plugged in. The simple installer walks you through everything else.</p><p>But maybe you're not ready to leave Google or Apple behind, and that's fine. Both companies offer great reasons to buy their products and are a good choice for everyone on most fronts.</p><p>If you're interested in privacy, having a little more control over your digital life, or even curious about what else is out there, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/" target="_blank">head over to the e-foundation</a> and have a look. I think you'll like what you find.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The video gives viewers a peek into his memorable moments, as he shares stories looking back at some of his photos.</p><p>A short snippet of the video has been doing the rounds on TikTok, where Chan shows off his Pandas to the world. While these Pandas are definitely adorable, what caught our attention was the phone he was using. It looks like one of the latest foldable devices, due to the obviously visible hinge in the center.</p><p>When we looked a little closer, we saw that the phone is small enough to be held in one hand, and sleek too, when unfolded.</p>                    <blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@people/video/7511799977451080990" data-video-id="7511799977451080990" style="max-width: 605px; min-width: 325px;">                        <section>                            <a target="_blank" title="@people" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@people">@people</a>                            <p></p><a target="_blank" title="♬ Lofi - Domknowz" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Lofi-6799585653702019073">♬ Lofi - Domknowz</a></section>                    </blockquote>                <p>The device's form factor has led us to believe that it could either be the Huawei Mate X6 or the Honor Magic V3. Upon comparing screenshots from the video clip with his Honor Magic V3, Android Central's Nick Sutrich noted that they appeared to be identical phones. He specifically pointed out the battery icon, hinge piece, and corners of the device as being a match to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, others on the team speculate that Jackie Chan actually uses the Huawei Mate X6. It's a bummer that we don't get to see the rear panel of the device; it would've made it easier to guess. As for why we think it's mostly a Huawei Mate X6, it's because Chan has a history of owning Huawei phones.</p><p>The actor has been spotted using Huawei phones since 2016, and in 2019, when a fan gave Jackie a Huawei phone at an event, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/8days/jackie-chan-seen-buying-huawei-phone-once-said-all-chinese-people-should-use-chinese-products-429166">he reportedly pulled out three Huawei phones</a> and said, “I use Huawei and have several of them. Chinese people should use domestic products. Wherever I go in the world, I would recommend it to others."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PnqFqgzsd8PEq27wrjDg6W" name="Screenshots-comparing-Jacki-chans-phone" alt="Screenshots comparing Honor Magic V3 and Jackie Chan's device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnqFqgzsd8PEq27wrjDg6W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Later in 2023, the actor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cnalifestyle.channelnewsasia.com/8days/jackie-chan-seen-buying-huawei-phone-once-said-all-chinese-people-should-use-chinese-products-429166">was spotted shopping for a new phone </a>in a Huawei store in Chongzhou, China. Chan was seen browsing through different models and inquiring about them with Huawei staff.</p><p>According to someone present at the store, the actor wanted to buy the newly launched Mate 60  but was told it was out of stock and could only be pre-ordered. Later, he ended up getting the Huawei Mate X3. Considering Jackie Chan's fascination with the brand, our speculation is leaning towards the fact that the actor owns the new Huawei Mate X6, which was launched in November 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, most mobile service providers offer their customers some degree of international coverage, you just need to choose the data plan that works for you (and your budget). </p><p>Up until recently, only the most expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">unlimited plans</a> gave users international coverage, but that's swiftly changing as the wireless landscape gets more competitive. The Big Three (Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T) already include roaming in Mexico and Canada, but if you want faster speeds or data outside of North America, you'll need to do a little research. Fortunately, whether you're looking to join a Big Three or keep it simple with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">best MVNO carriers</a>, I've gathered all of the best data plans for international travel below.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="f1815a52-74d5-492e-96b2-a064b4df3bca">            <a href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/unlimited/" data-model-name="1.

You start by choosing a plan at a base price, and then you mix and match perks based on your needs any given month, each of which cost $10 per month. This can be super convenient if you have a trip coming up, because you can easily plan ahead by adding perks like TravelPass and hotspot data without any real commitment beyond the month in question. </p><p>The Unlimited Ultimate plan also gives you unlimited talk, text, and 15GB of high-speed data in over 200 countries worldwide. Once the 15GB runs out, you'll still get unlimited data at 1.5 Mbps, which is more than sufficient for most simple tasks. With a starting price of $90/month, the Unlimited Ultimate plan can be pretty expensive if you're just signing up for one line, although the price drops considerably when you bring the family along.</p><p>Alternatively, you could also sign up for a more affordable Verizon plan and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/plans/international/international-travel/travel-pass/"><strong>simply use TravelPass</strong></a>. This feature costs $12/day and gives you unlimited talk, text, and data in over 200 countries. Once you add TravelPass to your Verizon account, you'll only be charged for the days you actually use the service, which can come in handy if you generally rely on Wi-Fi calling when overseas. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.06%;"><img id="iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME" name="visible-smile-169.JPG" alt="Visible smile logo on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iW3ezBdsDXPBMzSRVTddME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="801" height="417" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Visible)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-visible-plus-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">2.

Subscribers to the Plus Pro plan will also get two days of Global Pass every month, which gives you unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of high-speed data in over 140 countries worldwide. That may not seem very generous, but you can also save up to 12 of these unused Global Pass days to use when traveling, which is pretty good for only $45 per month. Alternatively, you can pay for the annual version of the Visible Plus Pro plan and receive 24 Global Pass days to use at your convenience. Global Pass can also be purchased a la carte for $10 per day. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T" name="T-Mobile-Store.jpeg" alt="T-Mobile store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvTcxLK4iRKgLdiYgUZd9T.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1990" height="1119" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">3.

There are also a few surprising perks that I haven't seen anywhere else, such as free in-flight Wi-Fi and discounted hotels and rental cars if you book through T-Mobile Travel. International calling will still cost $0.25 per minute, but it's easy enough to just use Wi-Fi calling when you're overseas. </p><p>The problem is that the Experience Beyond plan is quite expensive, costing over $100 per month for a single line.

It's also home to Unlimited Premium, an interesting data plan that offers users a bounty of compelling perks, such as 100GB of Cloud storage, six months of YouTube Premium streaming, free service on select <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a>, and more. </p><p>The plan also offers a bunch of international benefits that may sound familiar if you read up on T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan.

Use a 5G-compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> and you'll even get 5G service in over 90 of the aforementioned countries. </p><p>Google Fi's Unlimited Premium plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you'll save some cash by adding up to four lines on your account. All things said and done, it's a pretty reasonable price for what you get, as long as you don't rack up costs overseas with those $0.20/minute phone calls.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>There are plenty of great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans">phone plans</a> for folks who regularly travel abroad, but that doesn't mean that there's a one-size-fits-all solution. Before you settle on one plan, it's important to consider your needs as a device user, your budget, and of course, your destination. </p><p>For starters, it's best to look at your current wireless plan and see what it offers. Do you only need talk and text on your travels? If so, how much? Do you need data for navigation or surfing the web? Asking yourself these questions is a great place to start when choosing a plan for your journey. And who knows, maybe your carrier already has a great option that'll work for you. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi" name="visible-sim-card-passport-hero.jpeg" alt="Visible SIM card sitting on top of US passport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBJsLpu2HdkkTFV4avmuSi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you can't get coverage from within your destination of choice, you could also look into your carrier's Wi-Fi calling policy. Wi-Fi is readily available in most countries across the globe, and if you don't frequently send texts or use data while traveling, it could be sufficient for your needs abroad.</p><p>Another piece of advice I'd offer is to watch out for <em>how </em>carriers describe their international coverage. For example, there's a big difference between "free calls <em><strong>in </strong></em>XX countries" and "free calls <em><strong>to </strong></em>XX countries". Both are useful perks, but they mean very different things. One will let you make calls from inside another country, while the latter example means that you can only call other countries from <em>inside the United States. </em>It may seem like an obvious distinction, but it's easy to get mixed up if you aren't careful. </p><p>Lastly, it's important to remember that many carriers offer international coverage a la carte, so you may not need to switch to an entirely new plan to use your provider's network overseas. Verizon, for instance, offers TravelPass in over 210 countries worldwide. It costs just $12 per day and can easily be activated on any of Verizon's data plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's an entire category of headphones and earbuds you may not be as familiar with: sleep headphones.

That's why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/quieton-31-sleep-earbuds-review">sleep earbuds</a>, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears exist — they are designed specifically for comfort in all sleeping positions. Most sleep earbuds are characterized by a low-profile design that rests within your ear canal, while open earbuds, sleep headbands, and sleep over-ears avoid it altogether.</p><p>There are a bunch of different reasons for why you might want to wear a pair of earbuds or headphones to sleep. Maybe you sleep with someone who snores or live next to a noisy train station. While traveling, you might want to block out airplane turbulence or car noise to catch some sleep.

These are pricey, but use advanced Bluetooth Low Energy tech to provide all-night sleep sounds while retaining a tiny form factor. Biometric sensors can figure out when you're asleep and automatically switch from a music or a podcast to white noise or sleep sounds. The Ozlo Sleepbuds are some of the most advanced sleep headphones you can buy. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="0a54ca50-fbb0-40f9-a752-484b43e8dad3">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4jEHBkaguGc5STcrok9YeP.jpg' alt="Nothing Ear (open) render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Nothing Ear Open</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best open earbuds</strong></em></p><p>Wearing earbuds all night can be uncomfortable for some, and if that's the case, the Nothing Ear Open are a great alternative.

The closest thing to a one-size-fits-all solution are the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20, which are affordable and comfortable sleepbuds aimed to fit in a variety of sleeping styles. They have neat tech inside, including an MEMS electrical sensor to track your sleep and create a quality score. With these earbuds, you may be able to ditch your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> or fitness band.</p><p>The Sleep A20 earbuds come with a pre-loaded sleep sound library, but also work as standard Bluetooth earbuds. In sleep mode, you can get up to 14 hours of battery life on a single charge — that's more than enough for even the longest snooze sessions. At $160, the Anker Soundcore Sleep A20 strike a nice balance between premium features and affordability.</p><p>Those on a budget might prefer the Anker Soundcore Sleep A10, the older model that's available for a $30 discount, sometimes more. It still offers solid battery life and features aimed to help you get a good night's sleep.</p><p>On the other end of the spectrum, there are the Ozlo Sleepbuds, which cost a lump sum of $350. For that, you get a premium set of earbuds and a companion charging case with a bunch of sensors and features. The earbuds include a sleep-detecting accelerometer, and the case offers a tap detection, ambient noise detection, an ambient temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor. All these factors can be used to determine your quality of sleep, and a built-in alarm helps you wake up.</p><p>Plus, you get Bluetooth Low Energy support for ultra-low power draw and Android features like Auracast. Though, for many, the price is too high with limited feature advantages compared to the Sleep A20.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ" name="nothing-ear-open-cu-in-hand-cu.jpg" alt="Nothing Ear (open)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rPyAhMqzK2ox3a94gBShWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having anything in your ear can be uncomfortable for some sleepers. If that sounds like you, we have some outside-the-box picks for favorable sleeping environments. For starters, you can consider the SleepPhones — a headband that covers your eyes and sports inbuilt speakers for media playback outside your ear canal.</p><p>There are also the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review">Nothing Ear Open</a>, which are open-ear buds that remain outside your ear canal. They're bulkier than the other in-ear options, but can be used in a variety of situations, like fitness and everyday wear. Side sleepers should pass on the Nothing Ear Open, but they're an excellent option for people who sleep on their back or stomach. Side sleepers can also opt to only wear one earbuds for a more relaxing experience.</p><p>A pair of over-ear headphones can come in handy for sleeping in upright positions, making them an amazing choice for airplane trips, train rides, and long road trips. For that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> are impossible to beat. They feature comfortable memory foam and vegan leather materials for comfortability and aren't too heavy. Plus, you get active noise-canceling — most in-ear sleepbuds only use passive sound isolation.</p><p>With USB-C and a 30-hour battery life with ANC active, the Sonos Ace can be your travel companion every step of the way. They're a great pair of everyday headphones, too.</p><p>When choosing a pair of sleep headphones, you should consider whether you're willing to spend money on a dedicated care of night earbuds. If you aren't, the Nothing Ear Open or Sonos Ace may be a more value-oriented option, as they can be used all day <em>and</em> all night. Regardless, you can't go wrong with any of the headphones or earbuds on this list for sleep.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google says these auxiliary systems will include users with a video production tool, an external camera, or a document camera. What's bringing this capability is a new option within your <strong>Settings > General </strong>tab.</p><p>Users will find a new "Share content from camera" toggle. After enabling, users should find their external cameras within the Presentation icon's "Camera" option in a meeting.</p><p>Google threw in something extra, stating its support for external cameras will bring 1080p and 30fps streaming quality.</p><p>While sharing external content becomes easier, Google Meet's update adds extra improvements for device-based presentations. The post states screen shares will have upgraded video quality, which improves the viewing experience when the presenter is scrolling or showing a video. Starting a screen share becomes faster, alongside a small UI update to make starting presentations and controlling them easier.</p><p>Google ends by stating a small QoL update lets an older presentation resume if a second presenter ends their sharing session.</p><h2 id="google-meet-s-in-the-spotlight-2">Google Meet's in the Spotlight</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.31%;"><img id="exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A" name="google-meet-share-content-from-camera-example" alt="Google Meet's latest update brings a "share content from camera" option for external camera use." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/exPxz2Jc6wy6MWCyfnrs7A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1047" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1036px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.92%;"><img id="swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A" name="google-meet-external-camera-selection-ui" alt="Google's external camera update for Meet lets users select which camera to use when beginning a presentation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/swrbG79YWSHtD5LgQ9kZ8A.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1036" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It seems this update isn't coming to regular end-users, as Google's patch notes only highlight Workspace users. Those with Business, Enterprise, Frontline (Standard), Enterprise Essentials and Enterprise Essentials Plus, Education Plus, and individual Workspace consumers will see these Meet updates.</p><p>Those on Google's rapid-release domain will see the update beginning this week (June 4), while those on the Scheduled-release domain will begin on June 11. The update should wrap up in ~15 days for both domains.</p><p>Google's been improving the Meet experience since earlier this year when an update for Android brought a redesign and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mixed-things-up-with-its-meet-redesign">a spotlight on emoji reactions</a>. The company said that update from February is designed to "organize features more intuitively." Moreover, emoji reactions took a front row seat during conference calls, so users can quickly react without playing with menus.</p><p>For computers, Google Meet started rolling out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-color-sampling-tile-redesign-rolls-out">classy new tile design</a> for callers in April. Meet now utilizes its "color-sampling" capabilities to grab colors from your profile picture and apply them to your card's background. It's also worth mentioning that Google Meet will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-meet-to-sunset-legacy-duo-features-in-september">soon sunset all legacy Duo features</a> in September.

While we didn't really know what it would be called, Nothing's CEO did some name-dropping today.</p><p>Carl Pei took the stage at the SXSW in London to confirm that indeed, Nothing will drop its accessory — "Headphone 1" along with the Phone 3 on 1 July. Until now, Nothing has only produced earbuds since launching its first phone.</p><p>While we don't really know what these headphones would look like or what the specs might be, sometime last month, Nothing's design team got to chatting in a YouTube video, and the team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping all the main specs a mystery.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just stepped off stage at @sxswlondon, a massive thanks to @lucyhedges for hosting the session.We discussed how we’ve built @Nothing by breaking the rules: ✖️ No copy-paste features ✖️ No corporate fluff ✔️ Just beautifully bold design, genuine community co-creation, and a… pic.twitter.com/dw90clG8Ea<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1930601394668487038">June 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>In Pei's X post, he stated that Nothing was built with "no copy-paste features," and is  "genuine community co-creation, and a belief that tech should feel different."

However, to combat this, Samsung developed software to "detect" signs of sleep apnea via the Galaxy Watch, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-global-availability-of-sleep-apnea-feature-on-galaxy-watch-series">that's now rolling out to more people</a> globally. In a blog post, the Korean OEM states its sleep apnea detection feature on the Galaxy Watch is arriving via the Samsung Health Monitor app in 34 European markets.</p><p>The company warns that "availability may vary depending on country-specific registration in some European markets."</p><p>Samsung states this is possible due to the feature's recent reception of CE marking in the European Economic Area. This marking states the Galaxy Watch's sleep apnea feature has met the European Union's health, safety, and environmental standards for consumers.</p><p>More than that, Samsung is bringing sleep apnea detection to users in Australia and Singapore. The company states it also had to walk through the appropriate governmental processes in order to bring the feature here, as well. The feature has obtained clearance via Singapore’s Health Sciences Authority and the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia.</p><p>Consumers in these regions with a Galaxy Watch 4 series device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">or newer</a> (with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> or higher) will have access to Sleep Apnea.</p><h2 id="improving-sleep-2">Improving Sleep</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:907px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.15%;"><img id="cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-global-expansion" alt="Samsung's Sleep Apnea feature present on a Galaxy Watch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFLw2jEqX3jvMiHKepaLyX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="907" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's been on a journey to improve users' sleep health via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-could-detect-blood-pressure-sleep-apnea-like-galaxy-watch">this Sleep Apnea feature since 2023</a>. It was then that the Korean OEM announced its sleep health feature had successfully passed through South Korea's Ministry of Food and Drug Safety. This meant the feature could launch on supported Galaxy Watches in the country as soon as "early 2024."</p><p>The Sleep Apnea feature leverages the Galaxy Watch's BioActive Sensor to alert users to potential signs of the medical condition. While Samsung says it is useful, it's not recommended for those who've already been diagnosed with sleep apnea.</p><p>Luckily for U.S. folks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-sleep-apnea-detection-us-fda-approval">the FDA passed Samsung's feature</a> through, meaning it could arrive on Galaxy Watches in the States. That announcement stated the feature could be utilized by consumers aged 22 or older; however, there's a requirement for the watch. If you're interested, you must wear your Galaxy Watch to bed as often as possible. Samsung says the device needs to track your sleep for more than four hours within a ten-day timespan.</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Currently, Call Notes will automatically play a spoken message explaining to the person on the other end of the call that it is being recording. Soon, that might change, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-call-notes-toggle-teardown-3564540/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports users could be able to turn off this spoken message in a future update.</p><p>The team at Android Authority tore down <strong>version 178.0.765584175-publicbeta-pixel2024</strong> of the Phone by Google app and found references to a toggle that would effectively disable the spoken Call Notes message. It's called <strong>Play audio tone instead of disclaimer</strong>, and the feature appears to work exactly like you'd expect based on its name.</p><p>Within the latest Phone by Google version APK, there are two new audio files that presumably relate to this feature. Android Authority surmises that they may be different tones for the beginning and ending of a recording session.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC" name="google-pixel-9-call-notes-transcript.jpg" alt="Call Notes summary and transcript on the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HV4oFxou98WazcAsXE34KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A chime or tone would make it harder for the average person to discern whether their call is being recorded with Call Notes. Unless you're a Pixel user with access to the feature, it's unlikely that you'd know these new Call Notes sounds are really disclaimers that a conversation is being recorded.</p><p>Of course, there is a clear benefit to people recording who want to be subtle, as this feature could remove the awkwardness that the current level of transparency can create.</p><p>At the moment, it's unclear when, or if, this feature will arrive in the stable Phone by Google app. The fact that it is visible in the Phone by Google app beta signals that this is something Google is toying with, but it's not a confirmation that a change will certainly be made.

The user states they've noticed this updated design surface on their Galaxy Z Fold 6, as of Wednesday, June 4. This isn't on the stable version of Google Messages, as the publication states, but it seems more users with the app's beta version are noticing it.</p><p>The Reddit post offered a few screenshots, which showcase a slight change to the app's text field menus, specifically for emojis and the plus icon.</p><p>It seems Google is working on reworking its tabs for Photomoji, Emoji, GIFS, and Stickers. These options are housed in a pill-shaped container, instead of being listed beside each other without any barriers. When tapped, the selected option will take on a more colorful aesthetic, per your Material 3 Expressive choice. The publication calls this a "connected button group," which seems apt.</p><p>Regarding the plus icon, the user noticed the options there are seemingly a little larger in circular boxes and slightly more spread apart.</p><h2 id="google-s-moving-ahead-2">Google's moving ahead</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1l3kfvd/material_3_expressive_on_galaxy_z_fold6">Material 3 Expressive on Galaxy Z Fold6</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages">r/GoogleMessages</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>On the other hand, where your texts are displayed, sees a slight change, as Google works in a solid-colored background. The chat bubbles seemingly remain the same; however, the texting field (the conversation) is now housed inside a rounded-corner container.

The company states this new design will focus on designs that feel good and make sense while helping you get more things done. M3 Expressive will lean heavily on colors and shapes to bring Android into this new generation of design. The entirety of the Android OS is expected to take on M3 Expressive, as well as several of Google's apps.</p><p>We've already seen some of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail/gmails-new-material-3-expressive-design-is-secretly-hitting-some-inboxes">new Expressive changes in other apps,</a> like Gmail.

Now Garmin has thrown its hat in the ring with a U.S. patent for tracking your glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels.</p><p>You can use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ppubs.uspto.gov/pubwebapp/static/pages/ppubsbasic.html">U.S. patent search</a> to find patent number "20250134464," which outlines how Garmin could use its watches' photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals — commonly used for heart rate and blood oxygen — to determine a "user's glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level."</p><p>As the patent explains, HbA1c checks the volume percentage of your blood's hemoglobin proteins that are "glycated," or bound or coated with glucose. Because glucose stays attached to red blood cells for their four-month lifespan, HbA1c "provides a long-term indication of the average blood glucose level...and is typically not impacted substantially by a single meal or activity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2550px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-4a" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing an "electronic fitness device" placing pressure on "human tissue," with various components calculating the level of pressure and sending it to the processor along with PPG data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4AGgPiVyDirFpJekzHyRR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2550" height="1434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Determining and monitoring HbA1c levels can help with the management of glucose and insulin," the patent continues, as diabetics want to maintain their blood levels below 7%. And lowering it below 5% "is believed to improve and maintain an individual's overall health."</p><p>Since, currently, people must draw blood to test levels, it's easy for people to be unaware of their growing HbA1c levels, or to avoid frequent testing because of the discomfort. That's why this "would be of great benefit to users of a wrist-worn device," to have this data available painlessly and continuously, the patent suggests.</p><p>This patented tool wouldn't replace the spot-check blood tests diabetics use on a daily basis. For that, Garmin partnered with Dexcom so you can continuously see your mg/dl of glucose from an attached Dexcom patch on your Garmin watch.</p><p>Instead, this seems more like a preventative tool that would warn prediabetics of bad glucose trends and encourage better fitness and nutritional habits to bring down your HbA1c gradually over weeks and months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR" name="Garmin-blood-glucose-patent-figure-2b" alt="A Garmin patent figure showing the bottom sensors of a Garmin watch, with dotted lines pointing to a zoomed-in look at the sensors with various labeled components." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEBmLRKeY5w3sQJqFyXZQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the hold-up on seeing this feature in Garmin watches now? The patent warns that "conventional electronic fitness devices" will struggle to provide accurate data in this area. Pressure from a tight band can compress your blood vessels, and the size of your ligaments and bones will also skew the results.</p><p>So the watch's processor will need to determine a "pressure metric value" to compensate for these effects and provide accurate results. Garmin's patent outlines how it will attempt to pull this off, but it'll need FDA levels of accuracy before we'd ever see this HbA1c tracking feature in a consumer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>Samsung execs have openly shared plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">put blood glucose tracking in a Galaxy Watch</a>, while Apple is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/03/31/apple-watch-glucose-monitoring-feature/">"many years away" from glucose tracking</a> despite several patents on the subject. We've even seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-heart-health-glucose-trends-annoucement">smart ring promise non-invasive blood glucose data soon</a>. It's no surprise, in other words, that Garmin would try to keep up with its rivals.</p><p>Interestingly, the patent also suggests its pulse spectrometry method could determine other chemical levels like SHb and MHb, signaling rare blood disorders where iron or sulfur binds with hemoglobin and interferes with your blood oxygen levels. And it would determine levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, which could help catch other medical conditions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many patents never see the light of day in consumer products.

In short, this test puts Chrome on trial, seeing how well its "critical components" perform within the Blink rendering engine. In the recent 139 dev build test, which Chrome conducted on an Apple MacBook Pro M4 with iOS 15, the browser achieved a score of 52.35, its highest yet.</p><p>While this beats out how Chrome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.chromium.org/search/label/the%20fast%20and%20the%20curious">scored last year</a> on the Speedometer 3 test, Google says this is all thanks to several additional optimizations.</p><p>It's not a huge number; however, Google states its optimizations have resulted in a 10% overall improvement for Chrome since August 2024. Google says this 10% boost could save all Chrome users roughly "58 million hours" when browsing, thanks to reduced website loading times.</p><p>To do this, the company says its Chrome team "focused on refining fundamental rendering paths across the entire stack." But achieving faster browsing speeds also meant Google needed to rethink how the browser leverages a computer's CPU caches.</p><p>Moreover, Chrome's improvements saw a major shift in how it optimized memory layouts. Google's team also reduced the number of "non-relevant" items Chrome caches. The post adds that an update to Chrome's usage of Apple Advanced Typography technology (for font shaping performance) speeds up the browser wherever text is.</p><h2 id="chrome-s-getting-faster-2">Chrome's getting faster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj" name="Google-Chrome-Android.jpg" alt="Google Chrome logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoqaNuc7sYrwQGd2Usbkcj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Chrome has consistently worked on its browsing speed in recent history, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-blows-the-competition-away-in-speedometer-3-tests">stunning Speedometer 3 tests</a> in 2024 were no exception. Since the benchmark debuted, Google said its browser improved by roughly 72%. What it highlighted last year was optimization for slower functions, which directly contributed to Chrome's overall speed increase.</p><p>Additionally, Google said Chrome was outfitted with better memory usage when drawing shapes while also cutting out "redundant" processes.</p><p>The latest test and the one from 2024 focused on computers, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-doubled-its-speedometer-scores-on-android-with-the-help-of-snapdragon-8-elite">doesn't mean Android phones were left out</a>, especially those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. A new version of Chrome, specifically enhanced for higher-end Android devices, doubled its old score on the Speedometer 2.1 test. There's no single way users will notice Chrome's improvements on mobile devices, as Google says these upgrades will affect all facets of browsing. Opening large documents should be a lot smoother and quicker, just to name an aspect.</p><p>With Qualcomm's latest flagship chip, Chrome on Android scored 33.3, blowing its old 18.4 score out of the water.</p><p>Regarding its recent test, Google says it will continue to enhance Chrome's browsing capabilities, and more updates will be on the way.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tablet is believed to be coming in only one colorway, the Storm Blue.</p><p>The screen boasts of being the best tablet display, measuring 13.2 inches, featuring 3.4K resolution, and a 7:5 aspect ratio. Underneath, alongside the flagship Qualcomm chipset, it features 12GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. Additionally, it also has a vapor chamber cooling system to ensure users have a smoother high-end gaming experience.</p><p>The prominent aspect of the OnePlus Pad 3 is its massive 12,140mAh battery capacity, with support for 80W Supervooc charging. It promises 17-hour-long video playback, 70 days of standby, an extra 18 percent battery with a quick 10-minute charge. An additional perk here happens to be the inclusion of an 80W charger for buyers in the U.S. and Canada.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="dMmvFb94iBy4sRar8eZMwS" name="OnePlus-Pad-3-04" alt="OnePlus Pad 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMmvFb94iBy4sRar8eZMwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus Pad 3 is shipping with Android 15-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-releases-android-15-based-oxygenos-15-heres-when-your-phone-will-get-the-update">OxygenOS 15</a> and is further promised with three years of Android OS updates and six years of bi-monthly security updates.

Rumors have swirled about Apple creating an ultra-slim iPhone 17 Air, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> was soon teased in January 2025, launching in May. While the company may have thought it had finally won a major race against the Cupertino-based tech giant, the Galaxy S25 Edge might turn out to be yet another case of Samsung focusing and allocating resources in the wrong places.</p><p>I bought the Galaxy S25 Edge, and even <em>I </em>can see the phone's apparent flaws. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">asked for Samsung to make this kind of ultra-thin smartphone</a> way back in November, in fact. To make this kind of controversial, niche device a hit, Samsung needs to address its flaws head-on. Not pretend they don't exist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-top-exec-addresses-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-woes">which is what it's doing</a>.</p><p>Even fans of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy">Samsung Galaxy</a> product line seem to <em>hate</em> the Edge, and that isn't an exaggeration. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsunggalaxy/comments/1kltccf/what_are_your_thoughts_on_the_galaxy_s25_edge/" target="_blank">Posts</a> on the Samsung Galaxy subreddit — a place where you'd expect the sentiment around Samsung devices to be somewhat favorable — are littered with complaints about the new device. One comment called the Galaxy S25 Edge the "dumbest Samsung ever" and added that it was "overpriced, unnecessary, and false advertisement." It has over 100 upvotes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge compared to an iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge (left) compared to the iPhone 16 Pro (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-edges-early-sales-seem-to-be-as-slim-as-the-phone-new-report-claims">hasn't disclosed early sales figures for the Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is somewhat odd for the company. It often shares sales data from its pre-order and launch period in its home market of South Korea, but it neglected to do so for this launch. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-is-struggling-to-sell-the-galaxy-s25-edge/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> reports that its sources say sales are below expectations for the smartphone.</p><p>If that's true, I'm not surprised. Samsung's messaging regarding the Galaxy S25 Edge has been far from clear. Instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/doechii-x-edge-live-event/" target="_blank">collaborating with Doechii</a>, the brand should have tried to convince people that the Galaxy S25 Edge <em>isn't</em> a flawed smartphone. Samsung should remind them that all the thick, heavy, and bulky smartphones on the market are really the flawed ones.</p><p>That's why I bought the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-pro">to replace my iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The latter is thick and heavy to the point that it's inconvenient. All the feature advantages it has over the Galaxy S25 Edge are inconsequential because of its size. I don't want to hold the phone up at a concert and use its 5x telephoto lens because it's heavy. Nor do I want to keep it in my pocket at the gym, or fight a weight imbalance when using the on-screen keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge with an Anker MagSafe battery pack attached." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuPHaVDkhBn62k9zCiCyUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge can go more places and do more things <em>because</em> it is thin, not in spite of its thickness. The battery life issue is wildly overblown — just buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">MagSafe/Qi2 battery pack</a> and stop worrying about it altogether. Charge your phone when you can throughout the day, like in your car or at your desk, and the Galaxy S25 Edge can free you from a big-battery smartphone that feels like a brick.</p><p>That's how I would've pitched the Galaxy S25 Edge to smartphone users. Samsung didn't do any of that, and it could be a fatal error for the Galaxy S25 Edge.</p><h2 id="once-again-samsung-isn-t-listening-2">Once again, Samsung isn't listening</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a classic case of Samsung not listening to or understanding its customers. Last year, Samsung copied Apple in designing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>. Things got so bad a Samsung executive was reportedly furious with the so-called "design plagiarism."</p><p>More recently, Samsung introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> with iOS-like features, such as a split notification shade and quick settings panel. Longtime <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1kk9kxe/oneui_70_is_now_too_ios_for_me/" target="_blank">Galaxy users aren't happy</a>. And to top things off, the Galaxy S25 Edge looks like a carbon copy of the iPhone 16 from the back.</p><p>All these controversial changes aren't working. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/top-10-bestselling-smartphones-q1-2025/" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a> recently revealed that the top four best-selling smartphones in the first quarter of 2025 were all iPhones. The first Samsung phone on the list earned the fifth-place slot, and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> fell to seventh place.

It's a cool idea, but it probably won’t cut it for serious gaming. That said, Puffin showing up doesn’t rule out a more classic Quest-style headset could still be in the pipeline later on.</p><p>Additionally, Puffin is said to focus on virtual screens, letting you set up a whole multi-monitor setup in VR.

I would argue that 2023's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review" target="_blank">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> were the first smart glasses product that made any real waves in the sector, and even then, that didn't even happen until Meta AI support was rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-multimodal-ai-video-calling-update" target="_blank">six months after launch</a>.</p><p>Now, we're looking at a year where we could see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">third-generation Ray-Ban Meta</a> release alongside a new pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR glasses</a>, as well as a smattering of other companies, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye" target="_blank">such as</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-project-aura-google-io-2025-xreal-eye"> Xreal</a>.</p><p>However, none of these glasses appear to be as advanced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>, which felt very much like a pair of glasses with a Meta Quest headset somehow crammed inside. Of course, there's a very good reason for that: cost. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynLm-QvsW0Q">an in-depth interview</a> last October, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth noted that production-level Orion glasses would cost $10,000 a pair if Meta started selling them last Fall.</p><div><blockquote><p>What better way to fund expensive assembly lines than with the help of seemingly unlimited military budgets?</p></blockquote></div><p>That's because the technology to mass-produce something like Orion simply doesn't exist. It could be built, yes, but it would cost <em>billions</em> to do it, and that cost would have to be passed on to the consumer in the form of $10,000 glasses that only a few rich enthusiasts would be able to justify.</p><p>So, what better outlet to fund this eventual road to commercialization than the U.S. government, and more specifically, the U.S. military?

Luckey was fired from Facebook two years after the company acquired his Oculus VR company, likely due to political reasons. "The people who ousted me, who orchestrated my destruction, who seized my baby from me, are not even at Meta anymore," Luckey said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@heaney_555/post/DKQdTFjIjkJ?xmt=AQF0wNqNu-DcDWwbIguM5jRl-jUm5LmpJlq0E3J0JXF-Ew">in an interview</a> last month.</p><p>This made it possible for Luckey and Zuckerberg to form a new partnership that would benefit both of them, helping to bridge the gap between AR and VR technologies that Luckey had created with those that Meta has funded since he departed from the company nearly a decade ago.</p><p>Better yet, Luckey notes that these new headsets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/gVXPERyRjOA?si=01TngSzb6cwai09E&t=3015">will be entirely made in America</a>, yet another miracle that seemed impossible in an electronics industry almost entirely dependent on China.</p><div><blockquote><p>Palmer Luckey's return to Meta's good graces ensures something huge is on the horizon.</p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, the partnership appears to encompass all of Meta's Reality Labs experiments, including Meta AI and its associated components.  "The collaboration builds on Meta's existing Reality Labs investments and its work supporting adoption of its Llama open source AI models for national security uses by the U.S. and its closest allies."</p><p>Once the assembly lines are built and resources are in place, it's a clear road to the affordable, American-made smart glasses that were once a part of science fiction. It could even be the path to something far greater than smart glasses, if all the right resources are in place to move more manufacturing to the U.S.</p><p>At the very least, it's the path that Zuckerberg can use to claim he's been right all along, amidst the visionless stock market investors who have complained their way through the last decade of Reality Labs' spending.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Meanwhile, new information reveals what to expect from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>Prominent analyst Ross Young on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-sizes-confirmed-report/">SamMobile</a>) has shared the screen sizes of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, including the external and internal foldable display. The latter seems to be a notable upgrade over the predecessor as it is tipped to be having an 8-inch screen. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 had a 7.6-inch screen in comparison.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed at 8.00” and 6.49”…Same as Z Fold 6 SE…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1930492026468073917">June 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>According to Young, the cover screen will also be seeing a sizable upgrade as it is expected to measure 6.49 inches, which is a step up from 6.3 inches from the previous iteration. It also means that the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">flagship foldable</a> will likely be identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-announced">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, which was announced back in October and confined to the Chinese market.</p><p>It came in as a surprise launch from the company last year, and alongside the bigger screens, the Special Edition was also lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6 — it was 1.5mm thinner and three grams lighter. Going by the latest information from Young, it appears Samsung is likely sticking to the design aesthetics of the Special Edition for the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.10%;"><img id="gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh" name="Samsung-galaxy-z-fold-ultra" alt="Samsung teases a Z Fold Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gUnm8fpf7MSkase53rkqEh.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>SamMobile further notes that despite the bigger screens, the next foldable from Samsung will still be sticking to the 4400mAh battery capacity as the Z Fold 6.

While some folks will be unhappy with the curved glass, it makes for a gorgeous phone that, when combined with the vegan leather back, makes it hard not to admire it constantly throughout the day.</p><p>It's also quite thin and light feeling thanks to the tapered edges, and the choice of PANTONE Forest Green is simply stunning. It's hard to find a better looking phone than this, even if it means finding a good tempered glass protector will be tough.</p><p>On top of being thin and light, this is one of the elite phones to feature an IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance rating, meaning it can take a real beating, be put in the dishwasher, and still come out running like a champ. It's also got a giant 5,200mAh battery inside that gives this stellar battery life, and 68W charging ensures you only need a few minutes to top the phone up before heading out the door.</p><div

It's not a bad processor, but it doesn't belong in a $550 phone. Period. Motorola sells the international model of this phone under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-edge-60-fusion-announced">Motorola Edge 60 Fusion</a> name, and it's roughly 30% cheaper than the Motorola Edge 2025.</p><p>As I've used this phone over the past week, I've encountered numerous performance issues, including hitches, lags, and stutters. These are not present in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, both of which are in the same price range.</p><p>Turning off the silly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">RAM Boost feature</a> helped performance for me, but it didn't erase the lags and stutters completely. This processor is also not performant enough to even run Minecraft's Vibrant Visuals setting at a playable frame rate. It's really a shame because, while this processor is marginally faster than last year's Edge 2024 processor, it pales in comparison to other phones at this price range.</p><div><blockquote><p>While most elements of the phone are excellent, the slow processors holds the entire experience back.</p></blockquote></div><p>While Motorola says the display is better than last year's, my own tests tell me otherwise. The small bump in resolution isn't worth the tradeoff in refresh rate, and this display has mura issues in addition to using color dithering to fake deeper colors than the panel can actually produce. Motorola still ships it with the excellent full DC dimming mode that I lauded the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> for, but the aggressive dithering means this isn't a great display for sensitive eyes.</p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 is only slated for two OS upgrades and three years of bi-monthly security updates. By comparison, Google and Samsung offer seven years of both at this price range, and companies like OnePlus offer five years, further reducing the value of this phone.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-competition"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Competition</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h89PYP9Hr4tnMLVQUwC8Wo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's biggest problem is that there is steep competition at this price point. If you're buying unlocked, your money is better spend on a Google Pixel 9a or a OnePlus 13R. My recommendation would be the OnePlus 13R for several reasons.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R features a substantially faster processor — nearly 200% faster, actually — plus four OS updates and six years of security updates. That's double what Motorola offers. It's not going to have quite as many AI features as Moto AI offers, but I don't think those things are device sellers, just fun stuff to have.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a is a great second choice that comes in a little cheaper at $499. The Pixel 9a also delivers a faster processor than the Motorola Edge 2025, but not as fast as the OnePlus 13R's processor. It upgrades the software update policy to seven years of OS <em>and</em> security updates, though, so this is a phone that you can potentially hold on to for a long time.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-edge-2025-should-you-buy"><span>Motorola Edge 2025: Should you buy</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-camera-01" alt="Taking a macro shot of red flowers with the Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wA5y2ow7qmts2XPvdcgqiT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You can get a great deal from a carrier.</li><li>You love Motorola's design, including the excellent vegan leather backs.</li><li>You want a phone with excellent battery life and fast charging.</li></ul><p><strong>You should not buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You get easily irritated by phones with slower processors.</li><li>You want to hold on to your phone for more than three years.</li><li>You hate curved screens.</li></ul><p>For the second year in a row, Motorola has made an excellent Edge phone that is simply too expensive for its own good.

You'll experience plenty of stutters and lags as you use the phone, and while turning off RAM Boost helps some, the experience is simply worse than other phones you can get for the same price. Plus, with only three years of updates, it's going to last half as long as a Pixel 9a or OnePlus 13R. Maybe next year, Motorola.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5040cebf-1aac-40aa-b3a1-268774c62b1f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:126.02%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGhPrkEnRR8Aq4uDyGb6eX.jpg' alt="An official render of the Motorola Edge 2025 in PANTONE Forest Green"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Edge 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Motorola Edge 2025 has a gorgeous PANTONE-certified vegan leather back, IP68/IP69 ingress protection ratings, excellent battery life, quick charging, and Moto AI features you'll love.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>My wife summed up the OnePlus 13s perfectly: "this just looks like a smaller iPhone, but with Android." That's basically what it is to use the OnePlus 13s; while it is good to see OnePlus making a compact device — the OnePlus X came out a decade ago — the 13s ends up deviating a bit too much from the manufacturer's design language.</p><p>Look, I get that most phones these days have a similar design, and I'm okay with that; switching to a flatter profile allows brands to slot in massive batteries, and that's undoubtedly a good thing. But with the 13s, it feels like OnePlus intentionally tried to make a device that's as close to the iPhone as possible, and it isn't just the hardware design — the changes to OxygenOS bring it closer to iOS.</p><p>I had the OnePlus 13s for over a month, and I used the device extensively in that time. This is what you need to know about OnePlus' compact flagship, and whether you should pick it up.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-specs-price-and-global-availability"><span>OnePlus 13s: Specs, price, and global availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeWaEqBKVwUhoGaSAn5T93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus unveiled the 13s in India on June 5, and the phone is going on sale in the country in the coming weeks. The device is identical to the OnePlus 13T that debuted in China back in April, with two differences: the 13s has a smaller 5,850mAh battery (the 13T has 6,260mAh), and the 13s gets a 32MP selfie camera with autofocus.</p><p>The 13s is available in two configurations: the base model with 12GB/256GB storage is going on sale in India starting at ₹54,999 ($640), and there's also a 12GB/512GB model that costs ₹59,999 ($699). The device basically slots in between the OnePlus 13R and OnePlus 13, and it isn't quite as affordable as I thought it would be.</p><p>Why the name change to 13s, you ask? OnePlus says it did so to highlight the fact that this is a smaller phone. As to why it didn't do so in China, your guess is as good as mine. Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is available globally, OnePlus isn't selling the 13s outside India, and the 13T is exclusive to China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 13s</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.32 -inch 120Hz LTPO AMOLED, 2640x1216, 1600 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 15 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB UFS 4.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Sony Lytia LYT-700, PDAF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN5 tele, 2x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP GalaxyCore GC32, autofocus, 4K video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP65 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, limited 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, AptX HD, LDAC, LHDC 5.0 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,850mAh battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>150.8 x 71.7 x 8.2mm, 185g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Green, Pink, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-design"><span>OnePlus 13s: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oyLyqYW39pBzTkzpvZpRz.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5050" height="2845" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The OnePlus 13s has a compact design with a good in-hand feel. </strong></li><li><strong>However, the design closely resembles that of an iPhone. </strong></li><li><strong>The phone is limited to IP65 water resistance, and the optical fingerprint sensor isn't in an ideal location. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Roundups</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone"><strong>Best compact phones<br></strong></a><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones"><strong>Best affordable phones</strong></a><strong><br>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones"><strong>Best OnePlus phones</strong></a></p></div></div><p>OnePlus says the 13s has a "stunning new design," but what it actually looks like is an iPhone.

OnePlus made several changes to the software this year, and the design brings it closer to iOS. A new addition is AI Plus Mind, a feature that collates photos, notes, and other data in a single location. If you have any information you'd like to save — bills, event QR codes, and so on — just press and hold the Plus Key, and it gets saved to Mind Space.</p><p>The utility uses machine learning to extract relevant information. If that sounds familiar, it's because Nothing's Essential Space basically does the same thing, and if anything, Google's Pixel Screenshots has a similar utility. I'll admit that it is useful in certain scenarios, but as of now, it doesn't do much other than summarizing information.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3" name="OnePlus 13s" alt="OnePlus 13s review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bq8UuJomJEBE2pqYV9y5G3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can't take your data out either, so it is tied to the device. As it stands, there isn't much to justify the feature, but it's clear that the manufacturer sees AI as a point of differentiation (like every other phone brand), so it should get better features in the coming months.</p><p>Most of the time, using the software on the 13s was an exercise in frustration. I migrated data from the Vivo X200 Pro, but it didn't install everything — basic apps like Amazon and Swiggy didn't show up, and I had to go to the Play Store and download these again. This is never an issue on other devices, but I ran into the same problem on the OnePlus 13 earlier this year, so I'm highlighting it.</p><p>Background memory management continues to be very aggressive, so if you have an app in the background, it will be shut down after a few hours. There is intermittent lag when browsing in Chrome, and it could just be a case of the device not being optimized ahead of launch, as I didn't see this issue on the regular model.</p><p>And then there's the usual AI-backed features. You get AI Search and AI transcribing along with translation, and they do a decent enough job. There's a new AI Call Assistant, and it is meant to provide real-time translation. I tested it with Hindi to English, and it just didn't do a good enough job translating the call on the fly; the resultant text was wrong in many areas, and it wasn't able to handle entire sentences.</p><p>Coming to updates, the 13s will get the standard four years of Android updates alongside six years of security patches.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-oneplus-13s-the-alternatives"><span>OnePlus 13s: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma" name="iqoo-13-16.jpg" alt="iQOO 13 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z8HbCAz4dXgnQR3uQFhnma.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the OnePlus 13R, and although it isn't as fast as the 13s, you won't notice any difference in daily use, and it has a bigger AMOLED panel and larger battery.

You get standout battery life, and the main camera takes good photos and videos.</p><p>That said, I'm not a fan of the design or the software. OxygenOS 15 is now veering so close to iOS that it just doesn't have any originality left, and there are enough annoyances with bugs that it wasn't enjoyable to use the phone. I'm sure these will be resolved a few weeks after the phone goes on sale — that's always been the case in the last three years — but I don't see why these couldn't be addressed beforehand, like every other phone manufacturer is able to do.</p><p>Most of the time, I felt like I was beta testing the 13s. The OnePlus 13 continues to be an outlier in that it didn't have any of these issues out of the box, and with the 13s, OnePlus is back to its usual shenanigans of launching a phone before it's ready. If you're willing to wait a few weeks (or even months), then the 13s has the potential to be a decent enough choice in this category. But as it stands, it just doesn't measure up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

OK, there are really only like seven, but it can seem like a million if you don't know what you're looking at.</p><p>First, you need to know that Chrome is Google's branding for anything and everything built from a specific code base. This code is openly available and free, so plenty of companies use it or parts of it in their own products. Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and many other web browsers are based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/no-chromium-browsers-arent-going-anywhere-any-time-soon">Chromium code</a>; however, Google doesn't control these programs or their branding.</p><p>Yes, Chrome is a brand, and Google does a lot to make sure it's a recognizable one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa" name="chrome-generative-ai-gemini-update.jpg" alt="Chrome gets a new generative AI update with Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wNiJg57PLFagd7kuHJFHoa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also need to differentiate Chrome a little bit. Not from other software, but from itself. You have three "major" flavors of Chrome:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/after-using-chrome-os-four-months-i-never-want-go-back"><strong>Chrome OS</strong></a> is an operating system built by Google and used to power lightweight laptops and mini-PC desktops. It's further split out into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-os-flex">Chrome OS Flex</a>, a version for devices that are a little older and no longer supported through the same channels, and unstable testing versions designed for developers.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-is-getting-extensions-but-not-like-youd-expect"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for mobile</strong> is a version of Chrome that will run on your smartphone. It's built for both Android and iOS from mostly the same code and is an officially licensed Google product. It's further split into a Stable, Extended Stable, Beta, Developer, and Canary version for different levels of feature testing. <strong>Right up front</strong>: if you find an article like this helpful, forget all about the Dev and Canary versions. They're usually pretty broken and <em>really</em> only for people who love to test stuff.</p><p><strong>The </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chrome-96-stable-rolling-out"><strong>Chrome Browser</strong></a><strong> for desktops</strong> is the last version you'll encounter. It's the same as the mobile version, only built for desktop computer operating systems like Windows, macOS, or Linux-based systems. It uses most of the same code base but offers a few more features that aren't in the mobile versions, most notably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-is-getting-extensions-but-not-like-youd-expect">extensions</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yW898rfyAU8H93z54gtmpN" name="google-chrome-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Chrome lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yW898rfyAU8H93z54gtmpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Confused yet? Don't be. All these bits of software could have individual names and be a little less confusing, but Google puts them all under the Chrome brand to strengthen it. The more products with a Chrome label and a good bit of interoperability because of the shared code, the stronger the recognition and development community will be.</p><p>You probably don't need to worry about browser rendering tests or any sort of web development, so that cuts things down a bit. You also won't need to understand the Extended Stable branch unless you're a corporate developer, so you can safely forget about it, too.</p><p>That makes things a lot easier.</p><h2 id="which-should-you-choose-2">Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8" name="Chrome-Logo" alt="The Chrome logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGkWXEEK3QACexpixsxsa8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing to consider is whether you should use Chrome at all. Most people do, and if you have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>, it's there whether you like it or not, but there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">other web browsers</a> for you to choose from. Some aren't as good, some are a little better, and they all offer a distinct feature or two. Spend some time checking a few out if you're curious, and you might like one enough to keep it around.</p><p>Second, if you're talking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>, you don't really have a choice. A Chromebook (or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebox" target="_blank">Chromebox</a>) comes from the manufacturer with the correct version of Chrome OS installed, and until it's no longer supported, you can only choose to run the stable version or a non-stable testing version. Avoid selecting one of those for a Chromebook you use daily. Keep things that are designed to be simple, well, simple.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On your phone, things can get a little weird. I'm going to tell you that if you're reading an article like this one and want to know a bit more about all this, stick with the stable version that is already installed on your Android phone. If you have an iPhone, just use Safari unless you have a specific reason not to. Again — keep it simple.</p><p>You'll see other articles or social media posts about all the cool things you could do with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-software-channel-chrome-os">unstable version of the Chrome Browser</a>. While tempting, remember that any of those that actually work as intended will make it into the stable branch of Chrome you're using.</p><p>These unstable versions are there to test changes at different levels of completeness — Canary is going to be brand new and busted, Dev might work enough to start testing how your development projects work with it, and Beta is there once someone at Google decides new code works well enough for a more general test with a few million users.</p><h2 id="don-t-rock-the-boat-unless-you-want-to-2">Don't rock the boat. Unless you want to.</h2><p>Really, this is a good way to test things. If I were a backend web developer, for my job, I wouldn't care how my software works with Chrome Canary or Chrome OS Canary. I would want to check out the latest Dev version to see if I'll need to make any changes, and for everyday use, I would run the Beta channel.</p><p>I'm not a web developer; I'm a guy who bangs on a keyboard for a living. I stick with stable Chrome all around. I don't want broken features causing me problems, and since I need to use Chrome for work, I stick to the latest release version. For goofing around, I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> on both my phone and my desktop computer for everything but online shopping. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/i-dont-know-what-id-do-without-chromes-autofill-feature">Google's tools to securely store payment options</a> are pretty great.</p><p>Only you know what your tolerance for broken stuff will be. The way to stay away from it (mostly, all software is buggy sometimes) is to forget all about it and stick with the stable version.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Something substantial was supposedly discovered in the Google Translate app's latest version, which concerns its results page. The tipster's evidence shows Google is preparing a "list of possible translations," as well as the most plausible/closest one.</p><p>The latter is featured at the top in larger text, accompanied by the definition and uses of the word.</p><p>However, beneath that, outlined in a thin border, is Google's planned "More translations" box. It's there that users could see other ways a word in English or another language could be translated for whatever you've chosen. Google will state whether these translations are adjectives or otherwise, alongside how they can be used in a sentence.</p><p>The tipster also discovered the ability to "expand" on these other translations. Selecting one of these alternate translations places it front and center (or front and higher?) on the UI, right below the word you wanted translated. The post states that two new options were found: "Regional Variants" and "Ask a question."</p><h2 id="google-s-fresh-future-2">Google's fresh future</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d" name="google-translate-revamped-more-translations-look" alt="A snapshot of Google Translate's potential redesign, which places your initial word large at the top with the translation under that and "more translations" further down." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rgfDsAkSbA7xcu8AJfU3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d" name="google-translate-revamped-insights-button-leak" alt="Google Translate's code suggests it could have an "Insights" button on the way, which shows how to use the word in that other language." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zXamq3irbi4byjwKxGGw3d.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The former gives some lengthy text about the word's usage in the country and its "core meaning," if available.

According to the post, speculation says the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will see a 256GB and a 512GB storage option. The leak touches on the possibility of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>, as well, stating a slightly smaller selection: 128GB and 256GB.</p><p>Colors are the other side of these leaks, but the publication only highlights the expected flagship Flip 7. Its information suggests the device will debut in a Coral Red, black, and blue option.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is supposedly launching with a blue option called "Blue Shadow." This is rumored to be joined by a black and silver color choice.</p><h2 id="the-next-watch-2">The Next Watch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-01.jpg" alt="One of the new watch faces on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication's sources also provided some alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic details, which claim it will arrive in a black and white option. The wearable leaks differ here, as the post states the regular Galaxy Watch 8 could see a 40mm and a 44mm size for interested consumers. Strangely, the rumors only mention one color option, Graphite (likely a silver tone), for these two size variants.</p><p>Leaks about Samsung's foldables and upcoming watches have cropped up more consistently recently, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-galaxy-z-flip-7-wont-see-a-price-hike">speculation about the former's pricing</a>. Supposedly, Samsung's next foldables might not increase prices in "most regions," and remain at $1,099 for the Flip 7 and $1,899 for the Fold 7.

It's your tool, so it should work for you. Of course, I mean that for everyone; a phone is a tool, but it's also a very personal belonging and deeply integrated into modern life. Each of us should have choices on how we want to use it.</p><p>That choice is slowly being taken away, and faceless corporations are deciding more and more what we <del>want</del> get. The best example of all this is AI. Whether you like it or not, want to use it or not, it will be there. It will only get worse from here.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-galaxy-ai" alt="The Galaxy AI welcome screen on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra running One UI 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ekn2mwwza3B283LYzRd7n6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Case in point — Samsung, like Motorola, looks to be working on deeply integrating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">Perplexity AI into its Galaxy smartphones</a>. I'm going to be upfront — I do not trust Perplexity as a company. I'm not claiming there's anything malicious going on, but the company's track record simply gives me no reason to trust them.</p><p>I really don't trust Google, Samsung, Apple, or anyone else either, not when it comes to the ability to do anything with my phone. Once something is deeply integrated into the OS, such as an AI agent from the factory, all bets are off. You probably can't tell exactly what it's capable of and must blindly trust people who aim to make a lot of money from you. This has to stop.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji" name="google-io-ai-google-gemini-action-intelligence" alt="Gemini Action Intelligence at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZTAXJrXYyGc5xvf7Ecsvji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I want to be clear about what I'm talking about. Phone makers use AI to do everything nowadays. AI tries to optimize your network connections, creates a photo when you press the camera button, and it's part of what tells your phone to stop charging before it blows up. I am not referring to this type of AI, although there may be a more effective, albeit more expensive, way to handle these tasks.</p><p>I'm talking about AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-unveiled">Google Gemini</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bixby">Bixby</a>, or now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a>. AI gets in your face if you let it, but it is always there to do things someone else decided you wanted it to do. When software like that gets a set of elevated permissions (meaning it can do <em>more</em> with the system and data than even you can), it needs to be because we asked for it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-alleged-renders" alt="Camera design update on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Render of what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may look like. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I wasn't planning on buying a new Galaxy phone this year, but it's one I will often recommend. I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung makes good products</a>. If I were thinking of buying one, seeing a third party in the mix in ways that could be too invasive, I'd probably decline. I'm not pointing my finger at Samsung alone — I'm also wary of buying a new Razr or a Pixel due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-and-perplexity-are-trying-to-change-how-you-use-your-phone">invasive AI that has been built into the system</a>.</p><p>I imagine there's a way to remove it if you're willing to do the work. Android isn't open like it used to be, but smart people have figured out how to keep doing smart things. I'm not going to worry about removing it. Instead, I'll just not buy into it, at least until I can have a little more faith in it.</p><p>The best option would be to let me buy a phone without all of it there in the first place. I should be the one to decide who has any control over my digital life, no matter how insignificant it may be. This won't happen, and eventually, I will relent or I'll be left behind; this is the future, whether anyone likes it or not.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some say you have to hold it to believe it, while others say it lacks features they like but comes with a hefty price tag.</p><p>Samsung's director of smartphone product management in America, Blake Gaiser, sat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/exclusive-samsung-exec-shuts-down-the-galaxy-s25-edge-haters-talks-triple-foldable">down with folks at Tom's Guide</a> to talk about this new flagship model and also address the elephant in the room — its battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-32" alt="All three colors for the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkMTXZP7nApS4saBieLjk4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gaiser described a phone as the "Goldilocks" of smartphones, giving users the best of both worlds in terms of design and performance. Speaking about how the Korean OEM designed this 5.8mm thin device, Gaiser said that "We really designed this from the ground up to be thin. The goal was to be thin without compromise." The company didn't want to take away features while chasing to create a slim phone, he added.</p><p>Samsung had to make a device that was durable, despite being extremely thin, by utilizing a titanium frame and Corning's Ceramic 2. "So that way, we're able to utilize every single component as efficiently and effectively as possible and making sure that how we put it together gives you a really good balance in the hand," Gaiser says.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Silver-Back-Camera-Lenses-10" alt="Dual cameras on the Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CoozfCZjnHhMrYZN66rw4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gaiser said they didn't want to compromise on anything while creating this phone, in reality, they did give the phone a smaller battery capacity when compared to the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series </a>lineup.</p><p>Battery capacity is a top priority for anyone buying a new phone, and Gaiser says, despite the 3,900 mAh capacity, the phone doesn't drain out by lunch, and it lasts people an entire day. "It has worked as well or better than the S24 base model and very close to the S25 base model," he added.</p><p>Speaking about the device's camera, since it lacks a telephoto lens with a 3x zoom, Gaiser says that the phone makes up for it with the latest camera tech as well as agentic AI. "From the chipset up, utilizing cognitive-aware engines so that your camera understands what you're taking photos of and is able to utilize AI to give you that perfect shot."</p><p>He also added that they've taken in account the most popular zooms that people use on the daily, and found out that users only end up using "the 0.6X to get those really wide macro views, the 1X, 2X and 3X," he added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the phone does have its own set of trade-offs, AC's contributor Nirave Gondhia says that these can actually be overlooked once you physically hold the device.

Rolling out today (June 4), Glance states Galaxy users will soon be able to "visualize themselves" in different styles and places.</p><p>Samsung's head and senior director of Galaxy Store in the U.S., Jason Shim, says, "By using AI to personalize content and shopping directly on the lock screen, it brings a smarter, more dynamic experience that reflects the forward-thinking spirit of the Galaxy Store."</p><p>Glance adds that this new experience is tailor-made for Galaxy users; however, it still leverages Google's Gemini and Imagen models. This "opt-in" experience will train its shopping capabilities using the selfies (or images) you provide. Glance says its software will create "hyper-real images of consumers" in outfits it believes you'd look the best in. When used from your Galaxy S25 Ultra's lock screen, Glance states users can easily access its app's features while also saving the look as a new wallpaper or shareable photo.</p><p>The outfits Glance AI pulls from include over 400 of its partnered brands and retailers across the U.S. and abroad. Purchasing the outfits you see remains easy, as well, with just a tap whenever something piques your interest.</p><p>Glance and Samsung's partnership will bring this new shopping app and lock screen experience to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25 series</a> (excluding the Edge), the S22 series, the S23 series, and the S24 series (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">the S24 FE</a>, too).</p><h2 id="2"></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:200.00%;"><img id="HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk" name="Glance-AI-app-01" alt="Glance AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HTprMKVMfLWuEV6fao3hbk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Glance)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In case you're wondering, Glance says its AI software is conscious of ongoing trends, "local events," social media content, and more. Additionally, Glance's shopping AI and lock screen experience will also inform users of sales, just in case you really want that outfit.</p><p>As previously stated, the Glance AI shopping app and lock screen experience are rolling out for those Galaxy devices today (June 4), available in the Galaxy Store.</p><p>In May, Glance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-ai-allows-to-shop-fashion-via-personalized-ai-generated-lock-screen-visuals">revealed its new generative AI-backed</a> shopping experience for phones and their lock screens. One of the differences Glances says it upholds is that it puts the user front and center with a curated set of outfits and styles. This all leverages the selfie you provide, as well as additional information, such as your age, body type, gender, and hit generate.</p><p>Glance's partnered brands include Levi’s, Old Navy, and Tommy Hilfiger.</p><p>It's also worth noting that this Google-supported company is interested in pursuing more AI styling assistance for beauty, accessories, and travel. This is all part of its plans for "later this year," so keep your eyes open.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This digital technology offers a ton of convenience and versatility when switching phones, making eSIM-compatible devices perfect for regular travelers. </p><p>Rather than putting your entire user identity into a tiny physical chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIMs</a> (or Embedded Subscriber Identity Modules) digitally preserve all of this information so you don't need to worry about it. This means that you can swap your eSIM to different phones or easily change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a> when you're travelling internationally, plus there's an inherent security benefit when you don't have a physical card that could be tampered with or stolen. Some Android phones even let you have multiple eSIM cards active at the same time. </p><p>Of course, not every Android phone is eSIM-compatible, and the ones that are can cost a pretty penny. But fear not — I've gathered all of the best eSIM-compatible phones below, with options for every need and budget under the sun. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h3>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="6bcb2b5f-0c2e-4331-a6cf-dd3fb6801ba9">            <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-esim-compatible-android-phones#section-best-overall" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy S25"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAJ2amipBfc3ahcYNfPVtb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 in Navy"><span class='featured__label hero__label'>Best overall</span></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">1.

And thanks to its compact 6.2-inch frame, it's also one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">best small phones</a> on the market today, making it a perfect pick for travelers and homebodies alike. </p><p>The phone is much lighter, slimmer, and easier to hold than the Galaxy S24, while the Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction ensures you can count on the phone's durability no matter where you are in the world. The flagship phone is also driven by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 Ultra and OnePlus 13, plus you get stellar AI-boosted software features, 12GB of RAM, and seven years of OS/security upgrades straight out of the box. The Galaxy S25 also boasts eSIM and dual-SIM support in both the United States and internationally, making it a versatile device for traveling overseas. </p><p>Again, the Galaxy S25 is unfortunately not a major upgrade over its predecessor, especially when you're looking at the cameras and battery life. That's not to say that these specs are <em>bad</em>, but they feel a bit underwhelming when you consider today's competitive Android landscape. Still, if you want a compact smartphone with eSIM support, the Galaxy S25 is going to be the best choice for most folks.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9" name="Google-Pixel-9a-on-ground" alt="The porcelain Google Pixel 9a sitting on top of bark on the ground." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8wpvHELb2TPLrXCayXfE9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-google-pixel-9a-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">2.

The vibrant 6.3-inch display is only slightly larger than the Galaxy S25, while the 2,700 nits of peak brightness and 120Hz refresh rate makes the screen an absolute pleasure to use (assuming you don't suffer from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">PWM sensitivity</a>). Under the hood you'll also enjoy Google's powerful Tensor G4 processor, 8GB of RAM, and some feature-packed cameras that are nearly unrivalled at this price point. </p><p>All of that is well and good, but the Pixel 9a's 5,100mAh battery is where the device really shines. In all of our testing, we found that the midrange phone could easily last two full days with casual use, while heavy gaming, streaming, and AI use gave us a full day of battery life before the Pixel 9a needed another charge. </p><p>The problem is that once the phone <em>does</em> need juice, the 23W charging speeds are a bit slower than we'd like. Nevertheless, when you pair the Pixel 9a's flagship-level specs with the accessible price tag and yes, eSIM support, you get an affordable device that's worth a closer look. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">3.

Sure, Motorola has been producing excellent foldable phones for years, but a new addition to the Razr lineup that costs over $1,000? Sounds more like a Samsung move to me, and not in a good way. </p><p>Fortunately, my concerns were swiftly allayed, as the Razr Ultra might literally be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">best flip phone</a> ever made. With this new release, Motorola has taken everything it's learned making Razr phones over the past few years and packed it into a super-premium, super-powered device. The Ultra comes equipped with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and 16GB of RAM for powerful performance, plus you'll enjoy an all-day battery with fast 68W charging. Both the inner and outer pOLED displays on the Razr Ultra (2025) are vibrant and functional, and the upgraded titanium hinge feels sturdy enough to last for years. </p><p>True, the Ultra's price tag is still a bit of a problem, and some may wonder if Motorola really <em>needed</em> to make a premium flip phone when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr Plus</a> already checked a lot of the same boxes.

After all, it's one of the few phones to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">a coveted 5/5-star rating</a> here at Android Central, and looking at the specs, it isn't hard to see why. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 is powered by the top-rated Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, plus you get an eye-friendly 6.8-inch OLED screen with a Display Mate A++ rating and IP69 durability straight out of the box. Senior editor Nick Sutrich even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl5QVUadfbs">stuck the phone into a dishwasher</a> to verify its water resistance. The cameras are just as good as the latest devices from Samsung and Google, and the phone's battery will easily last a full day on a single charge, whether you're gaming, streaming content, or surfing the web. The phone also has support for two Nano SIM cards <em>and </em>eSIM, which is awesome when you have an unlocked phone and travel frequently. </p><p>If I had to be nitpicky, I'd say the OnePlus 13's biggest faults lie in the limited AI features and six years of software support (Samsung and Google are both guaranteeing seven years these days). And if you're based in North America, you may have trouble accessing the phone's full potential through your wireless carrier, <em>especially </em>if you use an MVNO. OnePlus 13 deals are also pretty uncommon, which means you might need to buy the phone unlocked at full price if you're shopping outside of a major sale event. </p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>Given the ubiquity of eSIM compatibility in recent smartphones, it's no wonder that this list looks a lot like our regular guide to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> of 2025. Indeed, picking the best eSIM-compatible phone is basically the same as choosing a great Android device for any use case, but there are a few details to consider before you make your purchase.</p><p><strong>Carrier restriction: </strong>If you buy a phone that's locked to a specific wireless carrier, you'll only be able to use that carrier's network when traveling, thereby removing a lot of the convenience and flexibility of an eSIM. In other words, if you found a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra deal</a> through your wireless carrier, double check the company's locked device policy. Verizon, for instance, won't let you unlock your phone until 60 days after its purchase, making things tricky if you have a big trip coming up. </p><p><strong>Dual-SIM: </strong>Some of the best eSIM-compatible phones also support dual-SIM, which means you're getting the convenience of both a virtual eSIM and <em>at least</em> one physical SIM card slot. The problem is that many manufacturers aren't clear about their device's dual-SIM compatibility. Some devices that support dual-SIM in Europe, like the Motorola Razr Ultra, for instance, lack the feature in the US market. If you'd like a phone with dual-SIM support, check the product listings closely and do a bit of research before you commit. </p><p><strong>Other considerations: </strong>Of course, every traveler has their own priorities when shopping for a new phone. When it's your turn to make the purchase, consider what kind of user you are before settling on a product. </p><p>For example, do you need a phone that's rugged enough to take on the trail? The OnePlus 13 might be the best pick for you. Do you need all of the latest camera features to expertly document your travels? Then perhaps the AI-boosted Pixel 9 Pro is the right choice. Needless to say, if you're looking for a great phone with eSIM-compatibility, you can't go wrong with any of the options listed above, it might just take a little extra research to find your dream device. </p> ]]></dc:content>

The former ran a survey, seeking to identify the changes in online habits by users when it comes to scams and other malicious attempts. According to the research, "over 60% of US consumers perceive an increase in scams over the past year, with one third personally experiencing a data breach."</p><p>While this number seems high (and is undoubtedly is), Google says the data points toward positivity. It states that while users are seeing more scams online, they've felt more "confident in their ability to spot" and avoid them. The other side of this is 61% of users in the survey stated the majority of these scams appeared via email.</p><p>Witnessing and spotting scams at such a high number makes senses when you factor in Google's other discovery: "Half of Americans — and over 60% of Gen Z — spend at least 5 hours on their phones per day."</p><p>However, the way we manage ourselves online, such as keeping our accounts safe, isn't the same. Google and Morning Consult find that our perception of a "safe account" differs between the generations. For Gen X and Baby Boomers, they all prefer concrete passwords that you either have to remember or write down. Google states "over 60%" of people in these generations use passwords, leaving the other 30% to rely on social sign-ins.</p><p>The complete opposite is Gen Z, which reportedly leverages new sign-in methods like passkeys or social sign-ins — Millennials, too.</p><h2 id="spot-malice-cut-it-2">Spot Malice & Cut It</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:646px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:92.88%;"><img id="ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC" name="google-pixel-march-feature-drop-suspicious-texts" alt="Google is rolling out scam detection measures for texts and calls on the Pixel 9 and 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ooXk6xNch6sFiTpf7w69dC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="646" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While there is still a vast majority of Americans who prefer using passwords, Google highlights a few protections to utilize.

As such, the company draws awareness to other sign-in options, like passkeys. Moreover, the company states opting to create accounts with "Sign in with Google" is another viable choice. The post states choosing this option will give you the security of your Google Account wherever you're going — plus, you won't have to memorize <em>another </em>password!</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Google has been stepping up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">scam/fraud detection capabilities</a> in recent time. In its March feature drop, the company introduced a treasure trove of scam detection features for phone calls and texts in Google Messages.

I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">used the Buds Pro 2</a> extensively over the last six months, and they confirmed just what Nothing is able to achieve in the budget category; unlike every other pair of budget buds, the Buds Pro 2 have a distinctive design, terrific sound, and you don't miss out on any of the extras.</p><p>I'm glad to share that the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus are much the same. The retain the CMF sub-brand's design flair, and deliver the same great build quality along with sound signature — and yes, the orange color is intact. The Buds 2 are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Headphones-Cancellation-Integration/dp/B0DXPBRK9N">available for $49 on Amazon U.S.</a>, and they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/CMF-Nothing-Wireless-Earbuds-Resistance/dp/B0DZ81TM6Y">cost £34 on Amazon U.K.</a>, which is a decent deal when you look at everything you get. The Buds 2 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CMF-Buds-Plus-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0F3D2FTSD">cost $69 in the U.S.</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.tech/products/cmf-buds-2-plus">£49 in the U.K.</a>, and again, that's a standout value.</p><p>India is the brand's biggest market, and the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus are yet to go on sale in the country. Nothing is being aggressive in India, where the Buds 2 retail for just ₹2,699 ($31) and the Buds 2 Plus coming in at ₹3,299 ($38). The brand notes that sales will begin at the end of June, and like their predecessors, they will likely sell really well considering the sheer value — particularly with the Buds 2 Plus.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4H5Jk6vyjsMG7EuKYHqwZV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4H5Jk6vyjsMG7EuKYHqwZV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus have a similar design aesthetic, and they retain the distinctive cases that contains a dial.

The Buds 2 Plus come in a case with a matte dial, and the case has a soft touch plastic feel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4861px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7YDQ3r5qZeTVFPmHYqNpSV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7YDQ3r5qZeTVFPmHYqNpSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4861" height="2738" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You get a few features as standard on both: the same 4.5g weight, 53mAh battery within each earbud and 460mAh in the case, six mics, IP55 dust and water resistance, ability to connect to two devices at the same time, reliable ANC, Google Fast Pair, Bluetooth 5.4, and in-ear detection.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SxNn7hZUEAs2ZF7W4GSbbV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxNn7hZUEAs2ZF7W4GSbbV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4842px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="VpsFNBLPY5yLtgd92EQtZV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VpsFNBLPY5yLtgd92EQtZV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4842" height="2727" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Honestly, the Buds 2 by itself is a fabulous choice considering it doesn't miss out on much. The buds have a glossy finish around the shell and a matte stalk, and the gesture recognition surface is decent enough. The lightweight design ensures they don't cause any fatigue even with extended use, and they're comfortable to wear; they're not bulky at all, and deliver a snug fit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3AcqQXyJPNJUeFv9Ry8ihV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3AcqQXyJPNJUeFv9Ry8ihV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Buds 2 feature a 11 custom driver with Dirac tuning, and they sound fabulous. The bass in particular has good vibrancy, and it delivers a tight rumble that makes listening to most modern music highly enjoyable. The mids are clean, and you get a decent treble without any harshness. There's an equalizer that allows you to change the balance between the frequencies, and an Ultra Bass mode that cranks up the low-end energy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3mkfwqoqArriNpkzugCgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Buds 2 are the best-sounding budget earbuds, and Nothing deserves credit for not omitting features on the buds. They don't get AptX codecs or LDAC, but you get really good noise isolation, and it did an effective job tuning out the chatter of my mechanical keyboard (a Lemokey L5 HE) and the air con. The buds managed to last just over six hours, and that's quite good; there's also a fast charging mode that delivers over two hours of music playback with just a 10-minute charge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5040px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cu6voF8MWULwuTxyuP5XhV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5040" height="2839" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the Buds 2 Plus, they last just as long as the regular model, and the key addition is LDAC codec integration. Considering LDAC has been baked into Android for over half a decade now, you'll get higher bitrates if you're using a lossless source. The Buds 2 Plus have a slightly bigger 12mm driver that has a bit more grunt in the low-end, and they're just as clean with the mids and treble as the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4812px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCSPnGD3tYjfJG5ZnTxAVV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4812" height="2710" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I like the most is that the Buds 2 Plus have a custom sound profile that adjusts the audio based on your hearing; you take a test wherein you select what range of frequencies you're able to hear, and it tailors the sound accordingly. This makes a noticeable difference, and you get the same Ultra Bass mode and EQ controls.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qe4kTkaGeBWTHRj4iGtDgV" name="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus" alt="Nothing CMF Buds 2 and Buds 2 Plus review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qe4kTkaGeBWTHRj4iGtDgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Buds 2 Plus have the same design as the regular model, with a glossy shell and matte stalk, and they deliver a similar level of comfort. Of the two, I liked the Buds 2 Plus a little more because of the tailored sound and LDAC.

The Chinese manufacturer rolled out one hit after another; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a> was fabulous, and then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> came along, beating every other phone at taking photos and videos. Vivo built on that momentum with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, which is easily one of my favorite devices of 2025.</p><p>And now there's the X200 Ultra, which has a new design and even better cameras than its predecessor. Annoyingly, the phone isn't launching outside China; Vivo continues to limit its best phones to its home market, and it's having a hard enough time ensuring the device is in stock in the country.</p><p>So if you want your hands on the X200 Ultra, you'll need to go the reseller route. While I don't usually advocate it, the X200 Ultra is an outlier — it is no less than the best phone I used in 2025, and it easily outscores every other rivals in meaningful areas. I wasn't sure how Vivo could improve upon the X100 Ultra, but the X200 Ultra proves that it is possible.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Pricing and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5163px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view highlighted against grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7pzcNX3AD8rurDfsFuHzMS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5163" height="2908" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X200 Ultra on April 21, and the phone is now available in China. The base model has 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and it costs 6,499 RMB ($902) in the country. The 16GB/512GB model costs 6,999 RMB ($971), and there's a 16GB/1TB model that's 7,999 RMB ($1,112).</p><p>The device continues to be sold out in most variants, and as of writing, only the 16GB/512GB edition is available. Just like Xiaomi, Vivo is rolling out a custom edition that includes a Photography Kit, and this has the 16GB/1TB variant of the phone along with a dedicated hardware lens, case, camera attachment, and other extras. This is the variant I'm using, and it costs 9,699 ($1,346) in China.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.82-inch LTPO3 AMOLED, 120Hz, 3168x1440, Dolby Vision, 4500 nits max, Armor Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OriginOS 5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 35mm, 4K120 video, gimbal OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818, 14mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto, 85mm, 3.7x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.5 with autofocus, 4K60 video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (1TB model)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6,000mAh silicon battery, 90W charging, 40W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.1 x 76.8 x 8.7mm, 229g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>White, Red, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-design"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5174px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMVLVxwChWMiw8kuNkChYS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5174" height="2914" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Brands don't really change their designs all that much these days, and that's true of the X200 Ultra as well. The phone is a massive slab, and coming in at 229g — the same as last year — it is one of the heaviest around. To be fair, all of the Ultra models this year are on the heavier side as they switched to 6,000mAh batteries (outside of the S25 Ultra, obviously), and to its credit, Vivo did a good job with the weight balance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vLBU7aJWCcbzZJZAGhYiGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The back of the X200 Ultra is dominated by a gargantuan camera island; the phone houses four camera modules at the back, and given the size of each unit and the resolution you're getting, it's no wonder that the housing takes over a third of the back. Thankfully, there's no wobble when using the phone on a table.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The housing is cleaner this time as it just has a steel ring encircling it, and it adds a little bit of elegance to the design. In a similar way, the white model I'm using has a fluted pattern underneath the glass that breaks up the design quite well. The design extends to the halfway point of the camera island, so you get a nice dual-tone effect.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xjgRrjnpRFpEcikB66XHUS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view highlighted against grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjgRrjnpRFpEcikB66XHUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the X200 Ultra ends up looking that much more distinctive, and that is particularly true if you're thinking of getting the red model. The other key design change is the switch to flat sides; the X100 Ultra had a flowing design, but Vivo is emulating prevailing trends in phone design and switched to a flat profile.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kj7b3cc9S2tCqQin5hNaFS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kj7b3cc9S2tCqQin5hNaFS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, you get considerable bevels on the sides, so it isn't uncomfortable in the least to hold and use the device. And even though the X200 Ultra is heavy and has an oversized camera island, the weight distribution is ideal, and it doesn't feel unwieldy at all. Interestingly, you get a camera control button on the right that's similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and like those two devices, I didn't use it much after the initial novelty wore thin.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6JwAuHqE5SoLtCUetaJPDS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra profile view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JwAuHqE5SoLtCUetaJPDS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it doesn't look like it when you look at the images, the X200 Ultra is thinner than its predecessor, and it is a little shorter and wider.

It takes just over 52 minutes to charge the battery with the bundled charger, so there is no reason to charge the phone overnight.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-cameras"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="KwSVnrNh54rfaci8FwzL9S" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra showcasing camera island at the back against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KwSVnrNh54rfaci8FwzL9S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo isn't using a 1-inch sensor on the X200 Ultra, but the new 50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony Lytia LYT-818 module is fantastic in its own right. What's interesting is that there's a second Lytia LYT-818 sensor that handles wide-angle duties, and you get a 200MP Samsung ISOCELL HP9 tele lens with 3.7x optical zoom. Vivo isn't using a fourth sensor like the Find X8 Ultra, and honestly, the 200MP module is easily the best of any telephoto options available today.</p><p>The X200 Ultra has just about everything you can imagine; it does 4K120 video with the main lenses, and 4K60 as standard with all rear cameras as well as the front 50MP module, and it includes Dolby Vision at 4K60 as well. Video stabilization is decent out of the box, and there's an ultra stabilization mode that basically gives you clean footage while shooting handheld on the move.</p><p>You get a good range of shooting modes, and there's portrait video this time, giving you the ability to shoot video with a consistent background blur. The camera viewfinder has all the modes easily accessible, and you get Zeiss effects that alter the look of photos. I used the Vivid profile most of the time as it provides a vibrancy to the photos with high contrast, but there are a half-dozen effects available.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

camera shoots at a 35mm focal length now, with the wide-angle lens at 14mm, and the telephoto hitting 85mm. The phone has the best wide-angle lens of any device I used, and Vivo deserves credit for using the same module as the main camera — it makes a noticeable difference. Predictably, the wide-angle lens takes photos of the same caliber as the main camera, and that's just great to see.</p><p>The 50MP main lens is the best around, and it overshadows anything that Google, Samsung, and Xiaomi have to offer. I'll do a dedicated camera review of the device with the external lens, but the gist of it is that the main camera has better dynamic range and color vibrancy than the 1-inch main sensor on the X100 Ultra, and that is an achievement in and of itself. It delivers incredible shots in challenging situations, and even with little to no visible light, it produced images with plenty of detail and clarity.</p><p>What I like the most about the phone is its portrait shots; Vivo has proven over the last year that it knows how to deliver stunning portrait photos, and the X200 Ultra continues this trend. The phone takes shots with excellent detail and faultless background segmentation, and this is a key reason why I continue to prefer Vivo's phones over OPPO and Xiaomi.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra with external lens and all the accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ACePS75iSGBd7gPceXmbkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a similar vein, the 200MP telephoto is nothing short of extraordinary. The HP9 module is the best available today, and Vivo once again put it to great use, delivering crystal-clear shots at 3.7x and beyond. I was able to get usable shots at up to 30x, and it remains the best tele lens of any flagship you can buy today. Like last year, it doubles as a macro shooter, and you get decent detail in this mode.</p><p>Overall, the X200 Ultra is the best camera I used yet; it does a better job than last year's X100 Ultra, and there isn't any other phone that's able to measure up to it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-software"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra Android 15 Easter egg" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyhTJLDixfHbt8QpuQ3WcS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to other Vivo phones in China, you get OriginOS 5 instead of Funtouch OS 15 that is standard on global models. I like what Vivo is doing with OriginOS; the interface is fluid, and you get extensive customizability with exclusive features that aren't available in the global build.</p><p>Using a phone with a China-focused build isn't anywhere as limiting as it used to be just a few years ago; you can easily install the Play Store from Vivo's app store, and once that's done, you can sign in to your Google account (you'll need to go into settings to enable basic Google services), and then set up the phone as you would any other device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra notification shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rbj8mgzF3wAy3dcpaT3yiS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't see any issues with Google Pay or my usual banking utilities, and for the most part, it was just as seamless as using the global X200 Pro. However, there are two limitations: push notifications from WhatsApp and Gmail continue to be hit-and-miss, and in the case of WhatsApp, that included calls. Even if you disable battery optimization (which is enabled as standard), it doesn't make much of a difference.</p><p>I wasn't able to set up the Pixel Watch 3 with the phone — it just wouldn't connect to the smartwatch, and the app crashed constantly. So if you need to use a Wear OS smartwatch, know that you can't pair it with the device. Outside of these issues, there are no problems with using the X200 Ultra as a daily driver.</p><p>When it comes to updates, the X200 Ultra will receive four Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates, and while that is on the lower end of the scale, it is what Vivo guarantees on all of its devices. I would have liked to see at least five years of updates, but that isn't the case.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-the-alternatives"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: The alternatives</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2SeJ4hRpM2dXCPSnjMv6F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chinese manufacturers are doing a good job with their Ultra models, and the Xiaomi 15 Ultra has better cameras than last year and a design that's easier to hold and use. While it doesn't quite measure up to the X200 Ultra — I still prefer Vivo's camera tuning and auxiliary lenses — the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is sold globally, and doesn't cost as much as the X200 Ultra, making it a decent alternative.</p><p>The Find X8 Ultra is the closest rival to the X200 Ultra, delivering a similar caliber of cameras and all the other extras. Like the X200 Ultra, the Find X8 Ultra is limited to China and isn't launching in other regions, so it is just as difficult to get a hold of if you're outside the country. Out of the two, I'd get the X200 Ultra; Vivo's software continues to be better, and the design is cleaner.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X200 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfxdMXcoahvQKV9qTtFodS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5139" height="2895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need the best cameras</li><li>You want a phone with versatile lenses</li><li>You want a bright AMOLED with useful customizability</li><li>You need reliable battery life</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need global warranty</li><li>You want hassle-free software</li></ul><p>Vivo once again managed to deliver the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best camera phone</a> of the year, and the X200 Ultra doesn't have any notable shortcomings.

This could mean that all Samsung devices imported into the U.S. could see a 30-40% price hike.

While several people were lauding Samsung for creating a device that is slimmer (5.8mm) than a standard pencil, many were questioning why Samsung chose to trade battery for its design, as the device comes with a 3,900 mAh capacity, making users of the device reach for their chargers more often than not.</p><p>Another report posted by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/signs-of-poor-galaxy-s25-edge-sales-samsung-in-trouble/"> SamMobile </a>last month indicated the same slow sales scenario with Galaxy S25 preorders as well.

That said, it has only been four days since the device's in-store sales began, and considering that the phone is still fairly new, only time will tell if sales begin to pick up.</p><p>Nonetheless, despite some of its drawbacks, the Galaxy S25 Edge still has its perks.

With its 12.1-inch display, it's right in that "almost perfect" range for many, being smaller than something like the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, but still being large enough to enjoy watching videos or getting some work done.</p><p>Speaking of which, a new version of the OnePlus Stylo was also released along with an updated detachable keyboard. Neither of these comes in the box, which is a bit of a bummer, but the new keyboard has a few upgrades of its own. For one, it can be removed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-is-my-favorite-android-tablet">Pad 2</a> and will remain connected thanks to Bluetooth.

Although it's not the latest and greatest chip to come from Qualcomm, there's really not much that the Pad 2 can't handle. Best of all, the OnePlus Pad 2 won't put too big a dent in your wallet.

Its 14.6-inch display is larger than many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>, while being both slim and lightweight. Samsung also includes its excellent S Pen in the box, something that we're surprised and thankful to see on a yearly basis.</p><p>The continued rise in popularity of AI features helped spark a peculiar change for Samsung as it opted for the MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ as opposed to a Qualcomm chip. Samsung explained that it chose this SoC specifically because of its AI capabilities, which is quite important given the company's focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>.</p><p>This focus on AI continued with the release of an updated Book Cover Keyboard, which now dons a dedicated AI key. However, that will set you back another $350, so you might be better served by finding the Tab S9 Ultra's keyboard case to save a few bucks.</p><p>Samsung got a lot of things right with the Tab S10 Ultra, but it's still quite expensive. Even when accounting for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, this tablet lacks any cellular connectivity, which is a decision that still has us scratching our heads.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-gaming"><span>Best for gaming</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh" name="lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-usb-ports-highlight-promo-render" alt="Lenovo Legion Tab Gen 3 dual USB-C ports highlight promo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/syLPuURwsQ4nYproGe7Vrh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-lenovo-legion-tab-gen-3-2"><span class="title__text">3.

Lenovo solved this problem already with its Y700 series of tablets, but those were limited to certain regions, and the U.S. was not one of them. Thankfully, that's no longer an issue as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">Legion Tab Gen 3</a> is essentially the Y700, but rebranded for this market.</p><p>It's powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, paired with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, along with excellent battery life. All of that excellence is packed into an 8.8-inch IPS display, complete with a 144Hz refresh rate. You might be disappointed by the lack of AMOLED or even Mini LED, but this Lenovo has managed to source some of the best IPS panels we've seen, and that includes the Legion Tab Gen 3.</p><p>The Legion Tab Gen 3 provides an excellent mobile gaming experience, especially when paired with a telescopic controller. However, thanks to the smaller display and compatibility with the Tab Pen Plus, it actually does a pretty fantastic job as a digital notebook. There's even a "desktop mode," which isn't something we expected to see on a tablet of this size.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-connectivity"><span>Best connectivity</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1434px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="HxdUykyZJeGbAyWLCXCved" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-promo-render" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HxdUykyZJeGbAyWLCXCved.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1434" height="807" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-2"><span class="title__text">4.

The reason for this is that it might help determine whether having built-in cellular connectivity is worth considering. Sadly, there just aren't very many <em>good</em> Android tablets with a 5G chip built-in, as even Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is relegated to "Wi-Fi Only."</p><p>Even if the Ultra came with 5G, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE</a> would probably still be our recommendation. It sports a smaller 10.9-inch display, making it a great size for being a travel companion, while also including an S Pen in the box. Samsung also offers two different Book Cover Keyboard options, although you'll have to pay a bit more for either of those.</p><p>And when it comes to getting work done, Samsung DeX is just a couple of taps away. While the Exynos 1580 might not be able to keep up with some of the other options on this list, it's still more than capable of being a workhorse. But when the time comes to sit back and relax, the Tab S10 FE is great for that too, and you won't have to worry about finicky hotel Wi-Fi just to watch some YouTube or Netflix.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-compact"><span>Best compact</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT" name="boox-palma-2-white-black-examples" alt="The Boox Palma 2 in white and black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfKEvaGqmBb72EWgP4Z7nT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-onyx-boox-palma-2-2"><span class="title__text">5.

Not just while you're traveling, but also when you're back in the comfort of your own home. If you're looking for something that can also replace an aging or cumbersome laptop, then you'd want something that can be paired with a detachable keyboard.</p><p>If you plan on just lounging around at the pool and want to read a new book that just came out, then we'd recommend checking out an E-Ink tablet. Plus, some of them can serve more than one purpose, so you can reply to emails for awhile and when you're done, read your favorite books.</p><p>While there are a multitude of factors to consider, it's also important to think about whether you're <em>really</em> going to use the tablet. You might just end up opting for a completely different tablet than the one that you were originally considering. But as we've said before, there's something out there for practically every scenario you can think of.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div><p>Chances are, you've used an Amazon Kindle before. The first time I set my eyes on that gorgeous paper-like display told me it was the future of display technology, but its obvious limitations meant that future was likely decades away.</p><p>As we near the 20th anniversary of the first Kindle, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/bigme-b1051c-pro-color-e-ink-tablet-impressions">E Ink is better than ever</a>. It not only supports thousands of colors for a more magazine-like experience, but with refresh rates at around 40Hz, it's finally good enough for all kinds of content, not just books. As a result, we've got E Ink tablets, monitors, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">smartphones that can do basically everything you need</a>.</p><p>But another display technology may replace it in most devices. It's called Transflective Liquid-Crystal Display or Reflective Liquid-Crystal Display, often abbreviated as RLCD. RLCD takes a "traditional" LCD subpixel structure and gives it the reflective properties of E Ink, making it visible in any kind of light without using a backlight, all with up to a 120Hz refresh rate. It sounds like a win-win, but like anything, it's not without its faults. Let's break them down.</p><h2 id="daylight-meet-computer-2">Daylight, meet computer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9" name="daylight-computer-youtube-gardening" alt="Looking up YouTube gardening videos on a Daylight Computer in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qM3oqSdt7CnykDqXyHUgA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've been using a tablet for the past few weeks called the Daylight Computer. While the tablet is typically marketed toward the same crowd that would be interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/rise-in-minimalist-phones">a minimalist phone</a>, I'm most interested in it because I can use it outdoors during the summer without squinting my eyes.</p><p>The tablet itself doesn't look particularly special at first glance, but its design is thoughtful and impressive in a way that doesn't shine on a spec list. It has sizable bezels, which is <em>actually beneficial</em> on a tablet, as it provides a convenient area to hold.</p><p>The back of the Daylight Computer is made of a soft-touch material, giving it grippiness that aluminum tablets don't have. Plus, it's got a nice contour that fits your hand, unlike the rest of the overly thin and flat tablets.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2f5_1kGLY60" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>And while these design traits are wonderful, it's the display that really shines for me, pun fully intended. Go outside, turn off the backlight, and enjoy the brightest, fastest display you've ever seen. It's 120Hz, so it's liquid smooth, no matter what you're doing. More importantly, the refresh rate ensures that it doesn't feel slow or sluggish, unlike even the fastest E Ink displays.</p><p>Daylight Computer's founders ensured that the bespoke display was 100% flicker-free. While many displays claim to be flicker-free via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tuv.com/usa/en/eye-comfort.html">TUV Rhineland certification</a>, most of the time that means there's no <em>perceivable</em> flicker, not that the display is actually <em>flicker-free</em>. Daylight Computer is fully flicker-free, doesn't use color dithering or FRC, and is completely eye-safe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0v1ZZT5bVNA">based on my own testing</a>.</p><p>Its reflective nature also ensures that it works perfectly in any kind of light, and the dual color backlight means it's comfortable to use even in dim light. I particularly love that there's no perceivable ghosting, the way many LCDs suffer from, and the backlight doesn't have that faint glow that most LCDs have, either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-03" alt="Reading the Android Central home page on a Daylight Computer and an Onyx Boox Tab Ultra in direct sunlight" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGH3wHqCQitU56dZFK4HHN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not the first RLCD device by any means, but it's one of the best examples of how good the technology can be. Of course, like any technology, there are a few downsides. First, Daylight Computer's RLCD is black & white only. While it'd be fair to assume this was done for "minimalist purposes," it was actually due to reflectivity, according to the company's founder and CEO, Anjan Katta.</p><p>Katta told me that transflective LCDs become significantly dimmer when color is added to the mix due to the way pixel color filters operate. As a result of testing, the company decided that daylight visibility was more important than color. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPPsgGndJ48">This review</a> of the HannsNote 2, a color RLCD tablet, shows this off well.

As with any display technology, the answer depends on your needs. E Ink has been the go-to standard for a long time for anyone concerned with eye health and the negative effects of backlights with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, but RLCD is also completely flicker-free.</p><p>In fact, it's more flicker-free than any current E Ink product because the 120Hz refresh rate falls in the safest range, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">according to research</a>. E Ink needs to refresh the display fully from time to time, and the relatively slow refresh rate (under 40Hz) has the potential to bother people susceptible to epilepsy.</p><p>E Ink also heavily relies on using specific screen modes relative to the content. Faster refresh rates used for videos and website scrolling reduce the overall contrast and detail in order to make E Ink's magnetic dots move faster. RLCD uses a traditional display pixel structure, so the lights are either on or off and don't need to change modes for different content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-viewing-angles" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD at an extreme angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQevW8h8Y5DdEC6MhBmRTf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-shade" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD in the shade" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EW5UGZWHUeM2qu5T2LefSf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-devices-off" alt="Comparing the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD with the displays off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VZz5x4cER2RdZjBMVYBnQf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The RLCD screen on the Daylight Computer produces more detail than any of the E Ink tablets I have because of its higher contrast image, but it still somehow comes off looking "softer" than E Ink. Preference will dictate which look you prefer, but there's no denying the difference in contrast the Daylight Computer's RLCD provides.</p><p>Furthermore, color RLCD has issues with contrast on deep colors, based on existing color RLCD tablets, while color E Ink looks great across the board.</p><p>Whites on E Ink also look a lot better as they're actually <em>white</em>. The RLCD on the Daylight Computer has a very warm, green tint to it, which doesn't bother me, but it's worth noting as a quirk of the technology. Viewing angles are also poorer than E Ink, but again, I'm not sure how much this affects actual use of the product.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.20%;"><img id="6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf" name="e-ink-vs-rlcd-onyx-boox-tab-ultra-daylight-computer-detail-comparison" alt="Comparing the detail of manga on the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra's E Ink display with the Daylight Computer's RLCD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fzt4VYBvLthD4BYyqb2bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3000" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>RLCD also requires constant power to display an image, while E Ink magnetizes the image once, and it stays there until physically changed again. Think of E Ink a bit like an Etch a Sketch; once the image is there, it doesn't go away until you change or erase it.</p><p>That means RLCD tablets like the Daylight Computer can last days on a charge, but E Ink tablets may last weeks, even with regular use. Regardless of this, RLCD's 120Hz performance may be worth the tradeoff. It certainly is for me.</p><p>I've previously used an RLCD monitor, the EazeEye 1.0, and while that was illuminated from behind by natural light to ensure it's bright enough for normal computer use, I'm confident that a bit more time will produce something similar in a tablet that will eclipse color E Ink for most people. The HannsNote 2 is a great start for color RLCD tablets, and I hope to see more color RLCD tablets with great frontlights in the future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e9b317d5-88c9-425d-8751-9e39057b473f">            <a href="https://daylightcomputer.com/product" data-model-name="Daylight Computer"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:120.54%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9DNJdr87RcUKUButr7w7fJ.jpg' alt="A cropped official product shot for the Daylight Computer"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Daylight Computer</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get ready for a new kind of tablet that challenges assumptions.

Concrete details are unknown for now; however, a report from a South Korean outlet claims the company will return the event to New York this year.</p><p>Aside from Samsung's major phone and watch reveals, we're also keeping our eyes peeled for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8</a> (Android 16). Since Google is moving fast, looking for a Q2 launch of Android 16, Samsung is right behind them. The Korean OEM recently rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8 beta for the Galaxy S25</a> series at the end of May.</p><p>Users in the beta should notice a hugely revamped user interface and several key AI updates.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

I have been testing the Monitor III for almost nine months now, and my love for them has only intensified.</p><p>I had the opportunity to sit down and chat with the lovely team behind the redesign, and it gave me a deeper understanding of just why the Monitor III headphones are so much better than the older iteration.</p><h2 id="better-in-every-way-shape-and-form-2">Better in every way, shape, and form</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GJ7HejCKoVBssKSnw397KY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MrQT7WhavCxCrVvuUzgNCY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While the redesign isn't a dramatic rethink, it looks a lot more modern and streamlined now. The Marshall Monitor III <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">wireless headphones</a> are made out of recycled aluminum, silicon, and other materials. The engineers prioritized durability and performance without compromising sound quality and comfort.</p><p>The Marshall Monitor III headphones are the most compact pair on the market. You can twist and contort them to fit into the egg-like carrying case, which is made of leather and lined with luxurious red velvet. I found this size ideal for traveling as the case fitted into my carry-on very easily.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wVbm4DtkuUJcTkEiuajmzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The earcups are as soft as marshmallows. I have several piercings, and most headphones often don't sit well, pinching me and irritating my piercings. These cups don't do that, which is a welcome change. This wasn't an accident; Marshall tested with glasses, earrings, and a variety of other variables to ensure a comfortable wear experience.</p><p>These removable cups are made of 40% soft foam and 60% slightly denser foam with springs coiled behind the ears. These cushion ears and, at the same time, efficiently block out sound.</p><p>Marshall used this to improve active noise cancellation, as well as newer, more optimised mics. The ANC is adjustable within the Marshall app, and there's a dedicated ANC button to switch modes as well.</p><h2 id="a-win-for-durability-and-repairability-2">A win for durability and repairability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqBDsiRRLuvQ5V4WUrLzwX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love the fact that the Marshall team focused on durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/repairability-is-finally-going-mainstream-sort-of">repairability</a>, so users will be able to hang on to their Monitor III headphones for a very long time. The brand assured me that each crucial component of the headphones can be replaced within 10 minutes.</p><p>They even redesigned the circuit board with repairability in mind, reducing its 90 soldering points to 10.</p><p>In line with this thought process, the headband is more flexible now. It is made of TPU, not leather, so it can self-repair from minor abrasions and stay strong yet bendy. The cable connecting both cups isn't inside the band. Instead, it is threaded through the silicone flap underneath to make it easily repairable.</p><h2 id="thoughtfully-remade-from-scratch-2">Thoughtfully remade from scratch</h2><p>Much of the internals of the Marshall Monitor III headphones were remade from scratch, including the audio drivers and acoustics, to achieve the desired performance boost. The makers of the headphones benchmarked them against less commercial-sounding studio monitors.</p><p>Tuned with Marshall's signature sound, these headphones deliver the full spectrum of sound with every instrument standing out clearly and getting its moment in the sun.</p><p>The Marshall app for Android and iOS simplifies the process of customizing your Monitor III. This is the main control hub for your headphones where you can adjust the equalizer, choose presets, or customize your own.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSkgMXooq9yC7ZXh5gAF63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.33%;"><img id="ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III app screenshot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZyaXGUPz33VGVRNtS8oG63.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3240" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Users can also customize the M-button, which is the shortcut button that opens Spotify as a default setting.

The brand straight up doubled the battery life, going from 30 hours with ANC on to 70 — that's right, <em>70</em> — hours of playback with ANC enabled. And once you turn the ANC off, Marshall promises up to 100 hours of playback. It's the wildest uptime I have ever witnessed from a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> of this stature.</p><p>I have put this to the test again and again, getting so bold as to charge it once on an international trip. These headphones did not disappoint. No lie was told here. At this point, I often forget when I last charged the Monitor III.</p><p>I enjoyed constant playback on two back-to-back flights, blocking out the agitating sound of in-air turbulence or the plane's roaring engines taking off. It was a sensory delight with no fear of the battery running out at the back of my mind. What a blissful travel accessory!</p><p>As if Marshall didn't spoil us enough with that ridiculous uptime, these headphones support fast charging. A quick 15-minute charge gives you 12 hours of playback. That's an infallible combo.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-the-marshall-monitor-iii-anc-headphones-2">Should you buy the Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones?</h2><p>Personally, I can find no deal-breaking flaw in the Marshall Monitor III headphones. I'd give them a five out of five, but the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> support must be taken into consideration.</p><p>Another small issue that some folks might have with these headphones is the lack of a headphone jack. Many popular brands like Edifier include a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-headphone-adapter">headphone jack to USB-C converter</a> as well as a standard 3.5mm audio cable with their Bluetooth headphones, since they usually support both forms of wired audio playback.</p><p>Marshall chose to forego the standard audio port, though you can still use the Type-C port for wired audio playback. There's also a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the case, which can be used to connect the headphones to a computer or laptop that has an audio jack.</p><p>However, there's no way these minor drawbacks should hold you back from buying such a great, well-designed product. Something that's designed to last and is easily repairable deserves praise. This pair of headphones is Auracast-ready and has an insane battery life to boot, so I say go ahead and purchase it. You certainly won't regret it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0d40c8ec-e03d-4f41-aca0-1ea5824846f2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgNt9n6pWoCVoaKSua5PdL.jpg' alt="Marshall Monitor III"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Marshall Monitor III</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="90" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Made to last</strong></em></p><p>The Marshall Monitor III delivers 70 hours of battery life with ANC on, is future-proof thanks to Bluetooth Auracast, and has easily repairable parts that are durable to begin with.

This week only, for example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uakaxaa/"><strong>Samsung is slashing up to $1,000 off the 2024 foldable when you trade in an old or broken device,</strong></a> or you can grab a straight $400 discount by skipping the trade-in process altogether. Considering the foldable phone&apos;s steep price tag, these savings could go a long way.   </p><p>The deal is part of the company&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/"><strong>Discover Samsung</strong></a> event, which is ostensibly a way for the OEM to ditch old stock before unveiling a bunch of new devices in July. Nevertheless, plenty of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> are receiving similarly-great offers during the sale, so take a look if you&apos;re interested in grabbing a new device. </p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:865px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.61%;"><img id="Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-render-white.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qk9BrbQMCLYk6ofsRaMfP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="865" height="853" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 256GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99"><del>$1,899.99</del> <strong>From $899.99 with trade-in | $1,499.99 without during Samsung Discover Sale</strong></a></p><p>If you've been waiting for the right time to buy the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy z Fold 6</a>, this might be it. For one week only, Samsung is offering up to $1,000 of instant trade-in credit when you send in an old or broken device, potentially knocking the price of the premium foldable down to $899.99. </p><p>Don't have anything to trade in? Skip that part and you'll still receive $400 off, matching (or beating) the latest pricing from Amazon and Best Buy. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold6/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f956uzsaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="58434357-2e52-4eef-9937-881a51d67b8d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,899.99" data-dimension48="$1,899.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Although it wasn&apos;t the dramatic upgrade that we were hoping for, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market today, boasting two gorgeous AMOLED displays, a powerful Snapdragon chipset, and a durable folding hinge that&apos;s (nearly) invisible to the naked eye. Like all of Samsung&apos;s recent devices, the Z Fold 6 also guarantees seven years of security and OS upgrades, and you&apos;ll also receive access to all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> software features.</p><p>Once again, the Galaxy Z Fold 6&apos;s biggest problem is the price, which is why deals like this are so important. Even if you <em>can&apos;t </em>get the full $1,000 of instant trade-in credit, Samsung is being pretty generous about the old phones it accepts. Devices dating back to the Galaxy S23 Plus will land you $650, while select iPhones could earn you up to $700 off. </p><p>In addition to the instant trade-in credit, Samsung is offering up to 47% off select accessories like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro or Galaxy Watch 7 when you bundle your purchase with the Z Fold 7. In other words, do some shopping during the Discover Samsung sale and you might end up fully equipped with discounted tech before the week is up. </p><p><em>New Samsung foldable phones are coming soon.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-137">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Nintendo updated its Parental Control app on the Play Store with a redesigned interface and Switch 2 support ahead of its June 5 debut.</li><li>The app brings over parental controls for GameChat, letting parents decide who their kids can talk to and when they can use video chat.</li><li>The update also lets parents easily extend their child's play time on a Switch or Switch 2 by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes with the ability to disable the limit.</li></ul><hr><p>Nintendo just rolled out an update for its Switch parental control app, giving parents more control and a fancy new look.</p><p>The update arrived this week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nintendo.znma">on the Play Store</a>, spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich. One thing users will notice is the Parental Control app now has a cleaner, reworked UI. More importantly, Nintendo announces that the Android app now supports the Switch 2, which is perfect timing as the console is set to launch in a couple of days.</p><p>Nintendo states the app lets parents control a Switch 2's "access to GameChat." Parents can manage which friends their kids can speak to and "when they can use video chat." Additionally, the update gives parents the ability to connect and manage multiple Switch devices, as well as the ability to extend playtime limits with ease.</p><p>When tapping a connected Switch, parents will see a day-by-day breakdown of its activity. If your child has been playing, you will see how long they've played and whether or not you've granted additional time. Parents can then hop into a monthly breakdown to see days played and playtime averages.</p><p>For the playtime limit, parents will find the option to extend it by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes. However, there is an option, marked by Nintendo's Starman icon, to disable the daily limit. This will let your kid run wild in whatever games they're playing without worry (it is summer break, after all).</p><h2 id="just-gamin-2">Just Gamin'</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="u5nAHtby87XiWAArhMsNPG" name="nintend-parental-control-play-activity-update" alt="A snapshot of a parent's overview of a Switch's playtime broken down by days." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u5nAHtby87XiWAArhMsNPG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:269px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.05%;"><img id="46GAaBJXYyqZr4GPVKmHPG" name="nintend-parental-control-extend-time" alt="The Nintendo Parental Control app lets parents easily extend their child's Switch play time by five, fifteen, or thirty minutes with the option to disable the limit entirely, too." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46GAaBJXYyqZr4GPVKmHPG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="269" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>From the play-time limit area, parents can also manage any "restricted features" on their child's Switch or Switch 2. Nintendo states these are age-based restrictions concerning the games your child might play. The update was spotted early this week and should be readily available for all Android users to download/install via the Play Store.</p><p>Since Nintendo broke the news earlier this year, we've known that the Switch 2 was on pace for a June 5 launch. That means we're only two days away from having it in hand, and this parental control app update is likely in preparation for that occurrence. Aside from the device's redesign, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/">Switch 2 sports a new feature</a>: GameChat. The added "C" button lets users initiate a chat with friends that lets them share their screen to make it feel like you're right next to each other.</p><p>Moreover, there's a camera that users can grab to make things feel a little closer.</p><p>While we eagerly await the Switch 2 this week, it seems that Nintendo is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/this-is-how-nintendo-aims-to-stop-switch-2-emulation">trying to avoid Switch 2 emulation</a> on Android devices. It looks like Nintendo's "Game Key Card"</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google today, June 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-public-notebooks/" target="_blank">announced</a> public notebooks are arriving in NotebookLM. With a few clicks, any NotebookLM user can create a public notebook by generating a shareable link to the notebook.</p><p>This might sound similar to how shared files work in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a>, but there are a few key differences. For starters, public notebooks are view-only, so there's no avenue for collaboration on the sources and information within a NotebookLM project. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM</a> is all about customized studying and learning experiences tailored to the specific user, and that isn't changing.</p><p>While a NotebookLM project's sources can't be changed, there are still plenty of ways to interact with a public notebook using AI features. You can create a podcast-style explainer with Audio Overviews, generate an FAQ sheet for simple studying, or have AI write a briefing document. There's also the option of conversing with the Gemini-powered chatbot to ask questions about the source material within the NotebookLM public notebook.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe" name="Notebook-LM-Public-Notebooks-2" alt="Sharing a NotebookLM notebook with others using the new Public Notebooks feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDWqzqEj9s9BA3Nz6eqsKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To create a public notebook, users need to click the <strong>Share </strong>button in the top right corner of the NotebookLM and select <strong>Anyone with a link</strong> under the <strong>Notebook access</strong> section.
