Metric/statistical accuracy is incredibly important when it comes to understanding your fitness, and that's where things begin.</p><p>In the app, Oura states your step counts should be more accurate. The company says the app will forgo estimating your steps through "generic movements." Instead, the Oura app will more closely mirror the behavior of a pedometer, as well as machine learning for a more realistic step count. So, be ready to grab your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">Oura Ring 4</a> and get moving.</p><p>Moreover, Oura is improving the accuracy of Active Calories Burned, thanks to better heart rate monitoring. To be specific, Oura states the app's display of how many calories you've burned will factor in the intensity of your heartbeat. This will particularly come into play during exercises.</p><p>These features are rolling out to members globally.</p><h2 id="metrics-activities-more-2">Metrics, Activities, & More</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="erQnFnJPhAFcEG9FxL3Fuf" name="oura-activity-ring-example" alt="Models wearing the Oura Ring holding a tennis ball." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/erQnFnJPhAFcEG9FxL3Fuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="480" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Oura)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are a few smaller refinements for the Oura app's behavior, like All-Day activity tracking. The post says users will now see more insightful data regarding their movements and activities throughout the entire day (including things done between 12 am and 4 am). Additionally, if something isn't right, users can add/edit activities in the Oura app and the program will "automatically adjust" older Readiness and Activity Scores.</p><p>Oura details the inclusion of your heart rate from partner apps like Google Health Connect and HealthKit.</p><p>Speaking of automatic detection, Oura is adding more movement data, like running splits, via its updated fitness metrics. The company highlights the app's new ability to show more detailed run and walk information.</p><p>Active Minutes picks up a new Trend view, which will hopefully give users a more insightful overview of their daily, weekly, and monthly activities. Oura's updated fitness metrics and Trend view will arrive "later this summer" on Android. The other features, All-Day Activities, improved automatic activity detection, heart rate from partners integration, and add/edit activities are available today (May 21) for all users.</p><h2 id="more-partners-2">More Partners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Oura is incorporating your heart rate from partners like Google and HealthKit, there's more in store that expands your horizons.</p><p>The company states the Oura app will also integrate statics about you with other apps like CorePower Yoga. Starting May 21, Oura members will be able to see their sleep, heart rate, stress and Readiness data <em>inside </em>the CorePower Yoga app. Moreover, those using the yoga app and Oura will find a 15 percent off an All-Access CorePower membership once this rolls out.</p><p>Oura app will also integrate with The Sculpt Society on May 21, too. The Readiness score from Oura will hop over, giving users tailor-made workout suggestions based on your energy levels. Also, to celebrate, Oura members will receive  50 percent off their first two months of the TSS app using the code “OURA” at checkout.</p><p>Tomorrow packs even more as Oura says it's analytics will hop over into Open. The Open app will provide users with "personalized" recovery rituals based on your Sleep Score. Lastly, Technogym will be able to utilize your HRV, resting heart rate, and sleep patterns from the Oura app. These stats will work into Technogym's Wellness Passport.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, if you've followed I/O before, you may know there's a lot more happening behind the scenes than what you can find live-streamed on YouTube. There are demos, hands-on experiences, Q&A sessions, and more happening at Shoreline Amphitheatre near Google's Mountain View headquarters.</p><p>We've recapped the Google I/O 2025 keynote, and given you hands-on scoops about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR glasses</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">Android Auto</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a>. For those interested in the nitty-gritty demos and experiences happening at I/O, here are five of my favorite things I saw at the annual developer conference today.</p><h2 id="controlling-robots-with-your-voice-using-gemini-2">Controlling robots with your voice using Gemini </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pZoNjXPX6izDXqhWpBhoDD" name="Gemini-Robot-1" alt="Robot arms picking up objects with Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pZoNjXPX6izDXqhWpBhoDD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google briefly mentioned during its main keynote that its long-term goal for Gemini is to make it a "universal AI assistant," and robotics has to be a part of that. The company says that its Gemini Robotics division "teaches robots to grasp, follow instructions and adjust on the fly." I got to try out Gemini Robotics myself, using voice commands to direct two robot arms and move object hands-free.</p><p>The demo is using a Gemini model, a camera, and two robot arms to move things around. The multimodal capabilities — like a live camera feed and microphone input — make it easy to control Gemini robots with simple instructions. In one instance, I asked the robot to move the yellow brick, and the arm did exactly that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pTBau6dHeimWXB6WL5CRYL" name="Gemini-Robot-2" alt="Gemini's robot arms picking up a gift bag." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pTBau6dHeimWXB6WL5CRYL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It felt responsive, although there were some limitations. In one instance, I tried to tell Gemini to move the yellow piece where it was before, and quickly learned that this version of the AI model doesn't have a memory. But considering Gemini Robotics is still an experiment, that isn't exactly surprising.</p><p>I wish Google would've focused a bit more on these applications during the keynote. Gemini Robotics is <em>exactly</em> the kind of AI we should want. There's no need for AI to replace human creativity, like art or music, but there's an abundance of potential for Gemini Robotics to eliminate the mundane work in our lives.</p><h2 id="trying-on-clothes-using-shop-with-ai-mode-2">Trying on clothes using Shop with AI Mode</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x5QE9QgL3EHNMzuvLRkmt5" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-1" alt="The demo booth at Google I/O for Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x5QE9QgL3EHNMzuvLRkmt5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As someone who refuses to try on clothes in dressing rooms — and hates returning clothes from online stores that don't fit as expected just as much — I was skeptical but excited by Google's announcement of Shop with AI Mode. It uses a custom image generation model that understands "how different materials fold and stretch according to different bodies."</p><p>In other words, it should give you an accurate representation of how clothes will look on you, rather than just superimposing an outfit with augmented reality (AR). I'm a glasses-wearer that frequently tries on glasses virtually using AR, hopeful that it'll give me an idea of how they'll look on my face, only to be disappointed by the result.</p><p>I'm happy to report that Shop with AI Mode's virtual try-on experience is nothing like that. It quickly takes a full-length photo of yourself and uses generative AI to add an outfit in a way that looks shockingly realistic. In the gallery below, you can see each part of the process — the finished result, the marketing photo for the outfit, and the original picture of me used for the edit.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YfjjAjBupFnyrSKs4yEyZJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-2" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfjjAjBupFnyrSKs4yEyZJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">I'm wearing a virtual suit using Shop with AI Mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RohZt9S6rxKtw6TXhvuiLJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-3" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohZt9S6rxKtw6TXhvuiLJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">This is the marketing photo for the suit that Shop with AI Mode helped me digitally try on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N2AkFptCk7hDNTDBmfE9dJ" name="Google-IO-Shopping-Try-On-4" alt="The process of trying on clothes with Shop with AI Mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2AkFptCk7hDNTDBmfE9dJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">This is the photo Google used to help me try on clothes with Shop with AI Mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Is it going to be perfect?

There's no better example of that than Androidify, a tool that turns a photo of yourself into an Android Bot. To get the result you see below, a complex Android app flow used AI and image processing. It's a glimpse of how an app developer might use Google AI in their own apps to offer new features and tools.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A3RfY9MSQBrMbkB9rCHQBG" name="Google-IO-Androidify-2" alt="A custom Android Bot made using AI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A3RfY9MSQBrMbkB9rCHQBG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">No, this isn't Steve Jobs — it's me as an Android Bot made using AI.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Androidify starts with an image of a person, ideally a full-length photo. Then, it analyses the image and generates a text description of it using the Firebase AI Logic SDK. From there, that description is sent to a custom Imagen model optimized specifically for creating Android Bots. Finally, the image is generated.</p><p>That's a bunch of AI processing to get from a real-life photo to a custom Android Bot. It's a neat preview of how developers can use tools like Imagen to offer new features, and the good news is that Androidify is open-source.

For those unfamiliar, Lyria Realtime "leverages generative AI to produce a continuous stream of music controlled by user actions." The idea is that developers can incorporate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Lyria</a> into their apps using an API to add soundtracks to their apps.</p><p>At the demo station, I tried a lifelike representation of the Lyria API in action. There were three music control knobs, only they were as big as chairs. You could sit down and spin the dial to adjust the percentage of impact each genre had on the sound created. As you change the genres and their prominence, the audio playing changed in real time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dJzVPRcsSKeDWYGfNuv2Ze" name="Google-IO-Lyria-2" alt="Setting the Orchestral genre to 50% at a Google I/O demo of Lyria 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dJzVPRcsSKeDWYGfNuv2Ze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cool part about Lyria Realtime is that, as the name suggests, there's no delay.

Compared to basic video generators, Flow is used to enable creators to have consistent and seamless themes and styles across clips. After creating a clip, you can change the video's characteristics as "ingredients," and use that as prompting material to keep generating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k3HbZGnbRUQCPcoykq6Ch" name="Google-IO-Flow-Veo-2" alt="Creating custom video clips with Flow and Veo 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k3HbZGnbRUQCPcoykq6Ch.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I gave <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-2-video-generator-gemini-advanced-whisk-rollout">Veo 2</a> (I couldn't try Veo 3 because it takes longer to generate) a challenging prompt: "generate a video of a Mets player hitting a home run in comic style." In some ways, it missed the mark — one of my videos had a player with two heads and none of them actually showed a home run being hit. But setting Veo's struggles aside, it was clear that Flow is a useful tool.</p><p>The ability to edit, splice, and add to AI-generated videos is nothing short of a breakthrough for Google. The very nature of AI generation is that every creation is unique, and that's a bad thing if you're a storyteller using multiple clips to create a cohesive work. With Flow, Google seems to have solved that problem.</p><hr><p>If you found AI talk during the main keynote boring, I don't blame you. The word Gemini was spoken 95 times and AI was uttered slightly fewer on 92 occasions. The cool thing about AI isn't <em>what</em> it can do, but <em>how</em> it can change the way you complete tasks and interact with your devices. So far, the demo experiences at Google I/O 2025 did a solid job at showing the <em>how</em> to attendees at the event.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As you may have already heard, "AI" got a solid 92 mentions, but Gemini, the show stopper, snagged 95! But to be fair, the two defined the theme of this year's developers conference.

To begin, Gemini is going to receive Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">2.5 Flash model</a>, which is quickly becoming the "most powerful" version, improving reasoning and multimodality, the tech giant noted. Moreover, Google says 2.5 Flash is now better (more efficient) at code and long context.</p><p>According to the company, Gemini 2.5 Flash will be available alongside Gemini 2.5 Pro sometime in June. Additionally, Deep Think, Google's new reasoning mode, which is said to nudge Google's AI into "considering multiple hypotheses" before delivering its response, is currently being tested.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1617px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4iBY7BnxMFGjbpH6vixPBD" name="gemini-2-5-flash-google-io-2025" alt="Google Gemini 2.5 Flash availability" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4iBY7BnxMFGjbpH6vixPBD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1617" height="910" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tulsee Doshi, senior director & product lead, Gemini Models at Google DeepMind, demoed this new Gemini Model's text-to-speech capabilities.

You can talk back and forth with Gemini about what you're looking at through your device's camera.</p><p>For example, if you're feeling stumped on a project and need some help, simply tap the "Live" icon in Al Mode or in Lens, point your camera, and ask your question. "Just like that, Search becomes a learning partner that can see what you see — explaining tricky concepts and offering suggestions along the way, as well as links to different resources that you can explore — like websites, videos, forums, and more," Google added.</p><p>Gemini Live camera and screen sharing is coming to both Android and iOS starting today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-4" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfxY5HjEPrXfrXTvWK6u2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI Mode gains more features</strong></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode</a> is set to get a new Deep Search feature, which will give users a more thorough and thought-out response to their queries.

Everyone can try Imagen 4 today in the Gemini app, while Veo 3  is available today in the Gemini app only for Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yqg0oUaofH0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><strong>Flow</strong></p><p>If you thought that was all that Google could offer with image and video generation, then you've got to look at what their new "Flow" has to offer. It basically does the job of a script writer, a cinematographer, and an editor. Flow basically is built to help storytellers turn big ideas into movie scenes without spending the money to make one!</p><p>With Flow, you just type something like "A detective chases a thief through a rainy Tokyo alley," and Veo 3 brings it to life, complete with footsteps, rain sounds, and cinematic lighting.</p><p>You can tweak camera angles, zoom in, or switch perspectives like you're behind the lens. Building scenes becomes a breeze—add shots, change angles, remix elements, and it all stays consistent, like the one you see below.</p><p>At present, Flow is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S., with more countries getting access soon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4zqVrLI8a0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><hr><h2 id="google-beam-2">Google Beam</h2><p>Google announced a new video conferencing platform at I/O 2025, called Google Beam.</p><p>It is built to transform regular 2D video calls into more realistic 3D experiences. Essentially, what this means is that the platform will use the AI tech and special light field displays, multiple cameras, as seen in Project Starline, to build a live, detailed, 3D digital copy for the user.</p><p>That copy is then displayed to the person on the other side, using the same special light field display. This screen sends different light rays to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and volume without the need for special glasses or headsets. So Google Beam will make it seem like the 3D copy of the other person is actually "there" in the room with you.</p><p>"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust, as if you were face to face," Google added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R" name="google-io-ai-google-beam-02" alt="Google Beam at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fTSMtiify22rJcv72t7W5R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with Google Beam, the company is launching a real-time speech translation feature that allows people to speak freely, despite having language barriers.</p><p>For instance, if two people on a call speak different languages, such as French and English, each person can speak in their preferred language, and Google Beam will then translate the audio in real time.</p><p>It is expanding the real-time translation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a>, starting today.

The tech giant is calling the subscription Google AI Ultra, "a new AI subscription plan with the highest usage limits and access to our most capable models and premium features."</p><p>This plan is best suited for filmmakers, developers, creative professionals, or someone who wants to make the most out of  Google AI with the highest level of access. Google AI Ultra is available today in the U.S. for $250 a month (with a special offer for first-time users of 50% off for three months), and is coming soon to more countries.</p><p>That said, Google is renaming its premium AI plan to Google AI Pro. Priced at $20 a month, this plan gives users access to premium features as well. It includes access to the Gemini app with powerful models like 2.5 Pro and Veo 2 for video generation, alongside AI integration directly within Google apps such as Gmail, Docs, and Vids aimed at writing or proofreading.</p><p>Google says that subscribers also gain increased usage limits and premium features for NotebookLM, an AI research and writing assistant, and can generate and animate images with Whisk.</p><hr><h2 id="drum-roll-please-it-s-android-xr-time-2">Drum roll please.....

It also touched on Project Moohan, Samsung's XR headset that is going to be powered by Gemini, stating that it will launch later this year.</p><p>That said, Google didn't officially confirm a name for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-xr">Android XR</a> glasses, and all the demos they showed during I/O did have a "prototype" label on it.

Some apps (like Maps Street View) can't live up to the resolution potential and appear a bit blurry, but when I watched 4K nature videos on YouTube, I could sink into the landscapes.</p><p>I also watched an immersive 180° video and a normal 2D video enhanced with AI to add 3D depth to certain portions of the video. While Moohan's hardware is impressive, I wouldn't be as excited for the headset if it weren't for unique Android XR tricks like this.</p><h2 id="natural-gemini-navigation-2">Natural Gemini navigation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF" name="android-xr-video-player-ui" alt="A look at the video player UI of Android XR running on a Samsung Project Moohan headset in mixed reality" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8LPWcVz3R46fgHnxagqGF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I obviously can't show you what I saw in-headset, but the screenshots above and below felt like a fairly accurate representation of my experience.</p><p>By default, opening any app will bring it front and center as a 2D window.

Turned out it was the famous El Capitan, a 3,000-foot-tall granite formation. Gemini asked if I wanted to know more about its geology or its climbing history; I asked how many people had climbed it, and Gemini flattered me by saying it was a "great question."</p><p>While Gemini on glasses has to pass your questions off to your phone, Gemini on Samsung's headset processes on-device and feels much more responsive as a result. Gemini still has to stall sometimes by saying, "Let me figure that out for you," but that's probably better than an awkward silence where you don't know if Gemini heard you or not.</p><h2 id="only-moohan-s-price-has-me-worried-2">Only Moohan's price has me worried</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9SXVsWtmbfJkmHXMKFq5ve" name="Samsung-Project-Moohan-Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-2" alt="Michael Hicks testing Android XR on Samsung Project Moohan at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9SXVsWtmbfJkmHXMKFq5ve.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3024" height="1701" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">That's my "Wow, not bad!" face, apparently </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung will officially launch Project Moohan later in 2025, giving developers a few more months to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">new developer preview</a> to make XR apps for the headset.</p><p>But this is a premium productivity headset with powerful performance and gorgeous resolution, just like the Apple Vision Pro. I'm sure Samsung will try to undercut Apple's $3,500 price, but I'd guess it'll still cost <em>much</em> more than a Quest.</p><p>Most of my experience with Moohan focused on <em>casual</em> features, like you'd use while slacking off from work. But I can't judge from a 15-minute demo whether I'd want to use this as a laptop display (or replacement) for hours every day. That's a much higher bar to clear, and it makes Moohan more niche.</p><p>That being said, if (A) I can afford Samsung Project Moohan, (B) it pairs well with Bluetooth keyboards and mice for work, and (C) it ends up having a decent selection of VR games and streaming apps, then I'd absolutely buy and use Moohan on a regular basis.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tech giant has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1krbabf/android_16_qpr1_beta_1_now_available/">started rolling </a>out a preview of the first Quarterly Platform Release (QPR) for Android 16, ahead of its official launch slated later this year.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 (<strong>BP31.250502.008</strong>)<em> </em>Beta 1 comes packed with platform feature updates, meaning users get a preview of the new features that will appear on the stable version. This quarterly update promises just that — it brings the all-new Material 3 Expressive UI upgrade, which is said to be the evolution of Material Design 3.</p><p>Building on Material You, the M3 Expressive is said to be more vibrant and engaging at an emotional level. It leans on five key ingredients, such as color, shape, size, motion, and containment, that will make you pay attention to the icons that matter on your device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qKvRnMeZRAVc4uAG4zEFZH" name="gmail-fitbit-photos-material-3-expressive-animations" alt="Animations and design changes in Fitbit, Gmail, and Google Photos with Material 3 Expressive" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qKvRnMeZRAVc4uAG4zEFZH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The UI brings big changes in how we interact with it. For starters, you get a revamped notification shade that adds a customizable, sort of transparent design. The quick toggle section can now fit 12 or more icons, and you can customize their sizes and make them larger and better defined or smaller and more compact.</p><p>Apps like Gmail will also see a much-needed redesign. The M3 Expressive places the most prominent action icons right where you can see them instead of hiding behind menus.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JSkW5NpMNvEa5mag4n4ivc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPR1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JSkW5NpMNvEa5mag4n4ivc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJynj9mmYqjFs47CyFumvc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPRS1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJynj9mmYqjFs47CyFumvc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmnxnpdNicYYoTtG4wXNwc" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Pixel devices get the new Android 16 QPRS1 update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmnxnpdNicYYoTtG4wXNwc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The notification shade is the most playful part of the UI yet. You can see several notifications stacked together, and dismissing a notification delivers a "snap" off the group, with the rest of them "bumping" back together.</p><p>M3 Expressive also makes transitions much quicker and more fluid, actions like swiping away an app in recents, adjusting the volume slider, or bringing down the notification shade feel more "alive".</p><p>The UI applies background blur effects to the "Quick Settings" panel, app drawer, and recents menu. The entire UI revamp gives your device a more aesthetically pleasing look, which is more customizable than the previous version.</p><p>Furthermore, Beta testers also get a sneak peek of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's</a> latest live notifications and screen recording capabilities. Additionally, it brings a colorful Settings app redesign as well, grouping icons with different colors — sound settings take a shade of red, network icons are blue, display icons are coral, and so on, as seen below.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JtDXpyszm4BV6QYjnys9PB" name="Material-3-Expressive" alt="Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 rolls out to Pixels" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtDXpyszm4BV6QYjnys9PB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While those are a major chunk of changes that come with the new Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1, it also includes bug fixes, performance optimizations, and the August 2025 security patches, which Google details in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes-qpr">release notes.</a></p><p>Users who have enrolled in the Beta program and have Pixel 6 and newer, or the Pixel Tablet series devices, will receive an over-the-air (OTA) update to the latest Beta versions.</p><p>It is important to note that if you were previously enrolled in Android 16 Beta (and have not opted out), you will automatically receive this update and any future Beta updates.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm sure they'd slide down my nose from the weight if not properly fitted, and it's hard to judge weight fatigue in a quick demo period, but in theory, I could see myself wearing them all day without complaint.

I'm sure a few days with these glasses would show more pain points, such as battery life. But reasonable skepticism aside, I'm more excited about Android XR than I was going into Google I/O.</p><p>If Google can make a consumer-viable version of this reference design, I think it has a chance to outperform Google Glass.</p> ]]></dc:content>

At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">Google I/O 2025</a>, the company previewed upcoming features set to arrive on cars with Android Auto. I got to try a pre-release version of Gemini in a Volvo car with Google built-in, and came away awfully impressed.</p><p>There are two separate experiences heading to cars in the future, and the one you get will depend on whether your car supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-make-car-rides-more-fun-with-new-entertainment-and-navigation-apps">Google built-in</a> or Android Auto. For perspective, there are 250 million cars that work with<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review"> Android Auto</a>, but only 50 car models that work with Google built-in. The latter models include brand names like Chevrolet, Volvo, GMC, Ford, and Honda, but there simply aren't as many Google built-in (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-automotive-15-features-detailed">Android Automotive</a>) cars out on the road today.</p><p>The good news is that most of the enticing Google features coming to cars will work regardless of whether your car supports Google built-in or not. Crucial features like hands-free Gemini help for navigation, basic questions, media control, and natural conversation are available to both Android Auto and Google built-in users.</p><h2 id="google-built-in-makes-your-phone-optional-2">Google built-in makes your phone optional</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SwQDPkHvqZDavRst9BCN83" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-5" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

Essentially, your car's infotainment and climate control features become one with Android Auto. That unlocks new possibilities, like the ability to turn up the air-conditioning or disable defrost mode with your voice by asking Gemini.</p><p>If you have a fairly modern car, you might be thinking that you've used voice control before, so what's new about using Gemini on cars with Google built-in? The key advantage to using Gemini for voice control is that it can understand your commands in natural language. Previously, you might have had to memorize a specific keyword or phrase to get your car's infotainment system to successfully make changes based on your voice commands.</p><p>By comparison, Gemini can make changes on your behalf even when you use confusing phrases or say the wrong thing. In situations where you might get confused and stumble over your words, Gemini should be able to still uncover what you're trying to say. If you say something like, "Gemini, turn on the defroster," it'll complete the action without the driver needing to reach for a physical control or the touchscreen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JbGq8yiMyeXJBn6r8kthQ" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-7" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

Google says that developers don't have to specifically design their apps for Android Auto — cars with Google built-in can run thousands of apps already on the Play Store.</p><p>Additionally, the company is working with select brands, like Volvo, to integrate car manuals with Gemini. When asked about a specific light that flicked on in the Volvo demo car I tried, Gemini was able to read straight from the manual and explain that it wasn't something to be concerned about.</p><p>Lastly, due to the nature of cars with Google built-in, Google tells us that Gemini will include some offline capabilities on these vehicles, "and it will have a hybrid architecture, where those things will rely on on-device computing."</p><p>"At some point, a lot of the car makers are actively working to upgrade their hardware, and as you get that more powerful compute capabilities, Gemini will also take advantage of all of that."</p><h2 id="the-gemini-experience-is-coming-to-all-cars-with-android-auto-2">The Gemini experience is coming to all cars with Android Auto</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qfo9MeVLXtMEGYzyPivfn" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-6" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

Specifically, Gemini on Android Auto is going to make it easier for drivers to plan trips without manually tapping on their smartphone. You can ask Gemini to start <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps navigation</a> to a destination, and that's just the start.</p><p>From there, you can ask Gemini to find stops for a particular place along the way, or tell it to suggest a few options. It supports follow-up questions, like what time the second restaurant on the list closes. As someone who always makes sure to check a place's operating hours before I put my car in drive, having Gemini do that for me would be a serious convenience boost.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="48fHFmAQFcUdVmgHBza44" name="Android-Automotive-Demo-3" alt="Gemini on a car with Google Built-in a.k.a.

It's smarter and can do things like remember to always text a person in your contacts in Spanish, as Google explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/gemini-for-cars/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>But for me, the killer experience is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/gemini-live-real-time-screen-sharing-now-available-to-all-android-users">Gemini Live</a> on Android Auto.

Need to prepare for an important meeting or a job interview? Gemini Live can help you prep. Studying for an important test, or maybe something huge like the LSATs? Gemini Live turns a monotonous commute into a study session. That extra few minutes of conversation might help ease your nerves or give you the last bit of preparation you need to ace that test or secure that job.</p><p>The possibilities feel endless. You can see something on the road and ask Gemini Live about it, or simply ask the AI to keep you awake with conversation on a long road trip. Driving is a time-sucker for a lot of us, and having Gemini Live on Android Auto to talk with could be an easy way to better utilize it.</p><h2 id="when-is-gemini-coming-to-your-car-2">When is Gemini coming to your car?</h2><p>Android Auto users will get Gemini integration first, as it's arriving in an update "in the coming months." Meanwhile, the Google built-in experience is said to be coming "later this year." Nearly all of Gemini's best features are set to come to all the 250 million cars that support Android Auto.</p><p>Although the version of Gemini with Google built-in was pre-release and had a few bugs, the entire experience felt positive. Gemini seemed to be a much more reliable voice assistant than even Google Assistant, which has seen numerous feature deprecations and reliability concerns of late. Between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/future-of-android-is-ai-gemini-steals-the-spotlight-on-the-android-show">the Gemini support and a fresh user-interface</a>, the future of Android Auto looks bright.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> puts design over everything else making it the slimmest and lightest flagship from Samsung yet. Certain cuts to the cameras and battery have had to be made to achieve this, but if all you care about is having the lightest phone, it doesn't get much better than this.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> looks fat and heavy in comparison but in its own right, it's still slimmer and lighter than most other flagships. It's also a bit cheaper and packs a few more features than the Edge. If you're stuck deciding between which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phone</a> to choose, here's a breakdown of all the main differences and similarities, so you can make the right choice.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-jet-black-hands-on-8" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FNjVrhp9h7hLBgTiWZVnai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the front, both phones look pretty similar since they have the same display size of 6.7 inches. If you look closer though, the Galaxy S25 Plus has a slightly softer curve for the four corners, compared to the sharper corners of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Both phones use Samsung's Armor Aluminum frame and scratch-resistant glass for the front and back. The S25 Edge gets the latest Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 for the display and Victus 2 on the back, whereas the S25 Plus uses Victus 2 on both sides.</p><p>The layout of the rear cameras is also different as the Galaxy S25 Plus has individual cutouts for the three lenses, while the S25 Edge gets a little island with two lenses similar to the 2025 Galaxy A series phones. Both phones are IP68 rated for dust and water resistance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-07" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus on a table at an angle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gNFSyPBLYGm4Aukm8hZPJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4216" height="2372" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus have virtually identical display specs. The 6.7-inch screens have a Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel with a QHD+ resolution and adaptive refresh rate (1Hz-120Hz). Both have the same peak brightness of up to 2,600 nits and support HDR playback.</p><p>We've not got a chance to test the S25 Edge yet, but the S25 Plus' display performed really well in all lighting conditions. It managed to produce excellent colors, had great sunlight legibility, and everything looked crisp and sharp thanks to the high resolution and dense pixel count.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 256GB of storage, but Samsung is offering the 512GB variant for the same price as part of its launch offers. Typically, the 512GB variant costs $1,219.99. The Galaxy S25 Plus starts at $999.99 for the same base storage as the Edge, while the 512GB variant costs $1,119.99. The latter is typically available closer to $1,000 on Amazon, even without sales.</p><p>What's common between the two is the SoC. Both phones are powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, so performance should be more or less identical. We're yet to test the S25 Edge so we're not sure if Samsung has throttled the performance a bit in order to keep the chip running cool when stressed. That's something we will be keeping an eye on when we review it.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide; 12MP selfie</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10 telephoto (3x); 12MP selfie</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>45W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td><td  ><p>190g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Icy Blue, Mint, Navy, Silver Shadow, <em>(Samsung.com exclusive: Pink Gold, Coral Red, Blue Black)</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus has a better selection of rear cameras compared to the S25 Edge. The third camera is a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, which should capture sharper photos than the Edge's digital zoom. Samsung has equipped the Edge with the 200MP main camera from the S25 Ultra, and this allows it to do 2x in-sensor zoom with seemingly no loss in image quality. The S25 Plus has a 50MP main camera which is still quite capable, even though it lacks in resolution. Both phones are capable of 8K video recording and shooting in HDR.</p><p>Battery life is another area where the S25 Plus has the clear upper hand thanks to the massive 4,900mAh capacity. It also supports 45W charging but the charger needs to be bought separately. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 3,900mAh battery which is much smaller than the S25 Plus, and there's only 25W charging. Both phones have wireless charging rated at 15W.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-plus-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Plus: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-20" alt="Gemini on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSE67exCYcvrPz3FdhbdGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Plus should have pretty much the same software features. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. The S25 Plus and Edge will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> has a bunch of customization and useful AI features to play with.

It's simply the better phone thanks to the much larger battery and more versatile rear cameras. Compared to other flagship phones, it's actually on the slimmer and lighter side.</p><p>I don't see many people opting for the Galaxy S25 Edge over the S25 Plus, unless you must have the slimmest possible flagship. Samsung ideally should have done more in terms of design to make the Edge feel special, after all, it is a highly specialized phone. I'm still not sure what purpose it serves, other than maybe being a pre-emptive move against Apple's rumored iPhone 17 Air.</p><p>To reiterate, get the Galaxy S25 Plus over the S25 Edge. You'll thank me later.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf1746ff-7f40-413b-a4c6-6b84b6cbd9af">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QsN67o4CHF3kUwhW4KioyM.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus in Navy official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to get</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is the better phone compared to the S25 Edge.

Google states it wants to simplify daily, mundane tasks for users, turning longer browsing journeys into quick three-click sprints.</p><p>Earlier today, during I/O 2025, Google discussed what it wants out of Gemini, and that involves turning it into a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">World Model.</a>" To achieve this, Google is looking to incorporate the multitasking power of Project Mariner and the visualizing power of Project Astra into Gemini. More than that, they want Gemini's intelligence to be able to "simulate" and understand the world, so it can create plans for its users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's essentially a mix of the Galaxy S25 Plus and Ultra but put in an extremely thin and light chassis. On its own, it's a great little flagship option for anyone looking for something super-thin and light. The problem is with its pricing. It starts at a little over $1,000, which is about $200 shy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The Ultra is Samsung's hero product so anyone spending this sort of money on the S25 Edge really needs to think hard about one thing — wouldn't it make sense to spend a bit more and get a much better product? While the Galaxy S25 Edge doesn't really compete with the S25 Ultra directly, from a buyer's perspective, doing a comparative analysis is crucial in order to make the right decision.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most stark difference between the Galaxy S25 Edge and the S25 Ultra is the design. The Edge is ridiculously thin at just 5.8mm and extremely light at just 163 grams. The frame is Armor Aluminum and there's Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 over the display. The rear panel gets Gorilla Glass Victus. The corners of the S25 Edge have softer curves which actually feel nice to hold, based on our hour-long hands-on with the phone.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is boxier, heavier, and thicker than the S25 Edge. This is only amplified if you decide to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-cases">use a case</a> on it. The Ultra can be a bit cumbersome to hold for long with one hand or carry around in a pocket, due to its weight and awkward size.  It's extremely well-built though and sturdy thanks to the titanium frame. Its display also gets a special anti-reflective treatment which the S25 Edge lacks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have extremely high-resolution displays that look absolutely fantastic. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch LTPO Super AMOLED 2X panel, with a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution of 3,120x1,440 pixels. Incidentally, it has the same 2,600 nits of peak brightness as the S25 Ultra, so sunlight legibility should be on par. The bezels are extremely slim and the hole-punch for the front camera isn't distracting.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a larger 6.9-inch LTPO AMOLED display but with the same resolution, which means the pixel count is lower. It's still well above 450 ppi so you won't really notice this even when viewing the same content on both phones side by side. The anti-reflective coating on the Ultra is a game-changer when viewing the display under sunlight or with artificial lighting behind you, and it's a shame that the Edge misses out on it.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-24" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LsA2guYNRTpYU3bdU4tci.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge starts at $1,099.99 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and the 512GB variant is priced at $1,219.99.

The S25 Ultra comes in four colors and this is not including the three exclusive shades that are only available through Samsung.com.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (up to seven OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz LTPO, up to 2,600 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide; 12MP selfie</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 50MP ultrawide + 10 telephoto (3x) + 50MP telephoto (5x); 12MP selfie</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W</p></td><td  ><p>45W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, 5G, USB-C (3.2)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>163g</p></td><td  ><p>218g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Silver Blue, Titanium Black, Titanium White Silver, Titanium Gray, <em>(Samsung.com exclusive: Titanium Jade Green, Titanium Jet Black, Titanium Pink Gold)</em></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and Gaalxy S25 Ultra use the same custom 'Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy' chip, so performance should be identical. We are yet to review the S25 Edge and we'll have a full report for you on its performance, but till then you can read out detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra review</a> to know what to expect. I suspect the Edge could have lower thermal thresholds due to its slim size, which could throttle performance of the SoC a lot quicker than the Ultra. This is so that the phone doesn't get excessively hot to hold. It's just an assumption right now as we'll know for certain once we review it.</p><p>Another compromise area is the cameras. The Galaxy S25 Edge only has two rear camera, one of which is the same 200MP main sensor from the Ultra. Samsung also talks about a 2x optical zoom which essentially uses an in-sensor crop to achieve it. The ultrawide is sadly just a 12MP sensor and not a 50MP module from the Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra has two additional rear cameras for zoom, one 3x telephoto and a 50MP periscope-style telephoto with 5x optical zoom. If you need long-range photography, stick to the Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" alt="Samsung-Galaxy-S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bs4kXScTBYTEFvzgXh8PQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, battery life is one area where the Galaxy S25 Ultra should easily beat the S25 Edge. We're talking a 5,000mAh capacity vs. 3,900mAh. With mindful usage, you should be able to squeeze out a full day's worth of use from the S25 Edge but I wouldn't expect anything beyond that. Heavy app and camera use could knock down battery life even quicker. The S25 Ultra should easily sail through one full day and more on a single charge as no amount of software optimization can compensate for a physically larger battery.</p><p>Charging speeds are also better on the Ultra. You get 45W fast charging here, compared to just 25W on the Edge. Given the smaller size of the battery, 25W should still be decently quick but not as quick as the Ultra. Wireless charging is the same 15W on both phones.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-software-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Mfgezq4tnLd6Z8gF7viLRY" name="drafted-message-google-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Drafted Message from Google Gemini on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mfgezq4tnLd6Z8gF7viLRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge and Galaxy S25 Ultra should have identical software. Both phones run One UI 7 which is based on Android 15, and should be getting all future updates roughly around the same time. Both will be getting seven years of OS upgrades and security patches. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right around the corner,  we should see the One UI 8 update pop up for both pretty soon, once the new Galaxy foldables are launched.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> is Samsung's best software update yet. The new visual design is very pleasing, you can finally switch the app drawer to vertical scrolling without being forced to install a third-party launcher, there's much better customizability, and plenty of AI-focused add-ons. Among the many Galaxy AI features, some of the standout ones include Photo Assist, Transcript Assist, and Now Brief.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra-which-phone-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra: Which phone should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-3" alt="Close-up on Galaxy S25 Ultra camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NKofa99vvYX25JRWmBEdUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As much as I love a thin and light phone, I cannot justify recommending the S25  Edge at its current price over the Galaxy S25 Ultra. I'd rather pay the $200 premium and get the complete flagship experience, and this is what I'd suggest you do too. In the long run, I think the heft and bulk of the Ultra is something you'll get used to, but not having certain features like telephoto cameras and a larger battery could end up being nagging issues.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge needs to be cheaper in order for it to be a real, viable option. Even a die-hard Samsung fan will have to really think twice before spending $1,000+ on it. It's a fantastic little flagship, no doubt, but it offers poor value for money at its current price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf1746ff-7f40-413b-a4c6-6b84b6cbd9af">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgaXFPcrVwTCJgerdmmLjV.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra official render cropped square"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one to get</strong></em></p><p>If you can get past the size and weight of the S25 Ultra, it's easily the better phone to get over the S25 Edge.

This will allow the glasses to run Google Play Store apps as well as Google's Gemini AI assistant, all in "a lightweight and tethered device," according to Xreal.</p><p>The render of Project Aura that Xreal provided shows three cameras up front to capture spatial data, meaning the glasses will be able to track the space you're in, similar to a VR headset. While Xreal didn't describe the experience, these glasses will be able to overlay virtual imagery onto the real world, similar to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-mwc-2024">we saw at MWC 2024</a>.

In other words, it will feel even more like a TV sitting in the real world than the glasses current 3DoF solution enables.</p><p>Since Xreal Eye uses a single camera, tracking won't be quite as robust as what will be offered on Project Aura glasses, which features three cameras for greater accuracy.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.33%;"><img id="bDzLUdnExotCcMbD3HDAkT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-01" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bDzLUdnExotCcMbD3HDAkT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="268" height="360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:272px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:135.66%;"><img id="xR8ESG7PLWvjLXpSD3kTjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-02" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xR8ESG7PLWvjLXpSD3kTjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="272" height="369" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:228px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:127.19%;"><img id="CPaMAiyUTduh7vaGW5DRjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-03" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CPaMAiyUTduh7vaGW5DRjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="228" height="290" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:148px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:193.24%;"><img id="tRp88KWuWUzBmhzJ6VXZjT" name="xreal-eye-official-render-04" alt="Official product renders of the Xreal Eye camera add-on for Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRp88KWuWUzBmhzJ6VXZjT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="148" height="286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Pairing Xreal Eye and Xreal One with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreals-new-ar-glass-companion-brings-android-apps-to-life-in-3d">Xreal Beam Pro</a> will deliver the full experience, including mixed reality video capture straight from the glasses' point of view.

Like in previous years, the focus is again on AI and its incorporation into its services.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/new-ways-to-do-your-best-work">showcased</a> a glimpse of AI integration in its Workspace products like Gmail, Meet, Vids, and Docs, and they get new capabilities.</p><h2 id="gemini-in-gmail-2">Gemini in Gmail</h2><p>Starting with Gmail, regular users will now be able to reply to their emails with the help of AI. In instances like replying to an email or a thread where gathering previous details could be an intriguing task, new personalized replies in Gmail are coming into play. Users can draft their emails through AI suggestions that match their specific context and tone.</p><p>The response suggestions here will be based on past emails, alongside Google Drive, to get additional context. Google notes that Gemini can further adapt to users’ tone eventually, which can be crisp, formal, or conversational.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W" name="Gmail-personalized-replies-feature" alt="Gmail personalized replies feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CXHYTwTwjhFEvLYqP2RL8W.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of emails, they tend to generally pile up, making users difficult to manage sometimes. That's where Gemini comes to your rescue again, as it can now start deleting or archiving emails with the new Inbox clean-up. Users will be able to tell Gemini to “delete all of my unread emails” from any specific user or a subscription to tidy up things in their inbox.</p><p>Additionally, fast appointment scheduling will be integrated into Gmail soon. It means users will be able to offer times for customers or clients who are normally out of their organization and not in their conventional calendar. Gemini in Gmail will also be able to detect when a user is trying to set up a meeting and give users “a helpful nudge,” making it easier to share the booking page right within the email app. The aim is to sort things out by reducing the time and effort spent coordinating schedules.</p><p>All the aforementioned features for Gmail will be available for the next quarter.</p><h2 id="google-meet-gains-language-translation-2">Google Meet gains language translation</h2><p>Google Meet should soon be able to diminish language barriers in calls as it is gaining a speech translation feature. It helps listeners in a call listen to their language despite the speaker speaking in their preferred language, that too in real time. Google is also promising low-latency while maintaining their voice, tone, and expression. Overall, the conversation across both parties is likely to appear more authentic and natural.</p><p>The speech translation feature is available for Google Meet users for those who are subscribed to Google AI Pro and Ultra plans in beta, and is initially available in English and Spanish. More of them are promised to be added in the coming weeks.</p><h2 id="google-vids-can-turn-slides-into-videos-2">Google Vids can turn slides into videos</h2><p>Google Vids, which was launched last year, is now gaining notable features. They can now turn existing Google Slides into engaging videos. Slides or presentations can sometimes be boring; however, they are essential in organizations, be it to train teams, onboard new employees, and explain things. Such slides can now easily be converted into videos through Google Vids, which presumably captures the audience’s attention more than the slides.</p><p>Gemini is further believed to generate scripts, voiceovers, animations, and more.</p><p>Google Vids usually help users record things, and they can sometimes have distracting or filler words like “ums” and “ahs”. Integration of Gemini in Vids will help users trim such filler words and awkward pauses through the transcript trim feature, which can be triggered with a single click. With the help of AI, users will also be able to adjust sound levels in instances where sound quality is uneven, eliminating the need for complicated audio mixing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V29y65jKLKqEgdfpuRXBsK" name="Google-Slides-to-videos" alt="Google Slides to video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V29y65jKLKqEgdfpuRXBsK.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Making training videos can be a hideous task, especially if there are dozens of them. Google Vids already allows users to make videos, and going further, users can just write a script and choose a new AI avatar feature to deliver the message on behalf of you. While the avatar does the talking, it claims to be handy to create polished video content and skip the process of coordinating talent and video production.</p><p>While converting slides to videos will be available for users next quarter, the Balance sound will be available next month, and transcript trim will arrive in Labs next quarter. The AI Avatar, on the other hand, is coming to Labs next month. Interestingly, all these features are included for those who are on a Google AI Pro or Ultra plan.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TUFaAEnWFQZz3vtUJExtd7" name="Google-Vids-AI-Avatar" alt="Google Vids" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TUFaAEnWFQZz3vtUJExtd7.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="imagen-4-in-workspace-2">Imagen 4 in Workspace</h2><p>Generating an image in Slides, Vids, and Docs just got better with the inclusion of Imagen 4—  announced today at Google I/O. It promises to enhance users’ visual storytelling as Imagen 4 helps create richer, detailed visuals, accurate spelling, and text rendering for images. And, it is available for users starting today.</p><h2 id="google-docs-gets-gemini-enhancements-2">Google Docs gets Gemini Enhancements</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ec7nhJrjgbfV9LN8RwsZJ7" name="Google-Docs-Gemini-enhancements" alt="Google Docs Gemini Integration" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ec7nhJrjgbfV9LN8RwsZJ7.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is also launching a source-grounded writing assistance to help users concentrate better when writing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-docs-is-tapping-into-gemini-to-whip-up-formatted-documents">Google Docs.</a> The sources that are typically dispersed around decks, data, and documents — and further stored in external links and Google Drive — can be brought into the assistant pane with the help of Gemini.</p><p>Users will be able to link relevant decks, data, and reports directly into a Google Docs document, where Gemini will be able to pull from these sources and simultaneously provide writing assistance. It further keeps suggestions intact and grounded in trusted content and eliminates the need for switching tabs. The feature is said to be available next quarter.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This plan is firmly set on the Gemini 2.5 Pro model, which Google says is wants to morph into a "world model." Hassabis states there's are hopes for Gemini to become an AI that can "make plans and imagine new experiences." This will reportedly be done by enabling the AI to "understand and simulate aspects of the world."</p><p>Google attributes this way of thinking and forethought to that of the human brain.</p><p>Hassabis says the company isn't starting from zero with these ambitions. The company has reportedly observed instances of this world understanding and simulation in Gemini when natural environments are involved. Google stresses that it wants Gemini to become intelligent, one that can understand the "context you're in" and "take action on your behalf, across devices."</p><p>Speaking of tasks, Hassabis explains that Google has been mulling over the thought of bringing Project Mariner into Gemini for multitasking.</p><h2 id="project-mariner-astra-2">Project Mariner & Astra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a> revealed itself to users in December, and Google says it's been hard at work, working with testers to gather feedback on it. Since December, Mariner has grown to have the ability to complete ten tasks at once, says Hassabis. The agents within Project Mariner enable the software to research information, book shows or other events, and research topics all at once.</p><p>It's this level of multitasking that Hassabis says will help usher Gemini into that "world model" ideal.</p><p>What's more, Project Astra will work in tandem with Mariner to bring Gemini into a more universal setting. Google states Astra's functions, like video understanding, screen sharing, and memory, will be a great asset. Project Astra has since worked its way into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>. From that, Google's taken in a load of feedback from users to bring even more to Gemini Live, Search, and the Live API.</p><p>In March, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">announced</a> that it was bringing Project Astra to Gemini.

This enabled people to have remote conversations that felt more like face-to-face interactions. Google is taking this "Magic window" concept of seeing another person, in life-size, three dimensions, right in front of you, and turning it into an AI-powered experience.</p><p>In its press release, Google noted that it will use AI to power a new generation of devices that will allow people to have meaningful conversations even though they're remote.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab" name="google-project-starline-call.gif" alt="Talking to someone on Project Starline" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEAwcPR9swrvKSD3jQxJab.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/research/project-starline-google-beam-update/">Google Beam </a>aims to transform regular 2D video calls into more realistic 3D experiences. Essentially, what this means is that the platform will use the AI tech and special light field displays, multiple cameras, as seen in Project Starline, to build a live, detailed, 3D digital copy for the user.</p><p>That copy is then displayed to the person on the other side, using the same special light field display. This screen sends different light rays to each eye, creating the illusion of depth and volume without the need for special glasses or headsets. So Google Beam will make it seem like the 3D copy of the other person is actually "there" in the room with you.</p><p>"This is what allows you to make eye contact, read subtle cues, and build understanding and trust, as if you were face to face," Google added.</p><p>Furthermore, this video conferencing platform is built on Google Cloud, just like Project Starline. The Cloud will do most of the heavy lifting for Google Beam. It will help the platform process these AI-powered 3D images and transmit them in real time to the person on the other end of the call, allowing for a seamless flow of 3D communication that seems more natural.</p><h2 id="real-time-speech-translation-2">Real time speech translation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WXsZ2hcC4opVgmiLkQh7VW" name="Beam-feature" alt="Google Beam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WXsZ2hcC4opVgmiLkQh7VW.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Along with Google Beam, the company is launching a real-time speech translation feature that allows people to speak freely, despite having language barriers.</p><p>This feature will let you have "near real-time translated conversations, while maintaining the voice, tone, and expressions" within the speech. For instance, if two people on a call speak different languages, such as French and English, each person can speak in their preferred language, and Google Beam will then translate the audio in real time.</p><p>Additionally, Google isn't restricting this feature just to Google Beam; it is expanding the real-time translation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a>, starting today.

To begin, Gemini is going to receive Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">2.5 Flash model</a>. Not only has the company touted this AI as its "most powerful" version, but its latest updates improve benchmarks for reasoning and multimodality. Moreover, Google says 2.5 Flash is now better (more efficient) at code and long context.</p><p>All Gemini users will find 2.5 Flash available in the app. Additionally, Google says this update will hit Vertex AI users with enterprise and for developers in the Google AI Studio.</p><p>Gemini's thinking capabilities are seemingly set for improvements, as Google details the incorporation of a new reasoning mode called "Deep Think." This mode is said to push Google's AI into "considering multiple hypotheses" before delivering its response. This is reportedly en route to 2.5 Pro (under the guise of 2.5 Pro Deep Think). This mode is in testing. Google states it is taking more time to conduct "frontier safety evaluations" and to hear more from the experts.</p><p>Once these initial hurdles are cleared, Google will prepare to release Deep Think more widely to users.</p><h2 id="gemini-2-5-rises-higher-2">Gemini 2.5 Rises Higher</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="naddjY6LTCN6Y4oF46V8wa" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro-Hero" alt="The Gemini 2.5 Pro graphic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naddjY6LTCN6Y4oF46V8wa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from these key highlights, Google details even more Gemini 2.5 capabilities as a result of its updates. There are three major updates, the first bringing "native" audio output and improvements to the Live API. Appearing today (May 20), Live API will deliver a preview of its audio-visual input and native audio out dialogue. This will give users conversational building capabilities within Gemini.</p><p>Moreover, this also gives users the chance to customize how Gemini speaks by altering its tone, accent, and "style of speaking."</p><p>This audio update brings an experiment for a trio of early features. Users will have a chance to play with "Affective Dialogue," which lets the AI "detect" emotions in a user's voice to facilitate an "appropriate" response. The Proactive Audio test will let Gemini ignore voices in your background, as it awaits a more proper time to respond. Thinking hits Live API for Gemini, improving its complex task capabilities.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner's</a> computer use functionality is headed for Gemini and Vertex AI.

This will be joined by Google's "generally available model," too.</p><p>Lastly, Gemini 2.5 is bringing MCP (Model Context Protocol) support.

According to its press release, the company says it the Play Store will soon receive "topic browse pages." The post claims this feature will deliver "timely, relevant, and visually engaging content on specific topics." These browsing pages will reportedly incorporate multiple aspects of the store, like App Home and store listings, among others.</p><p>We'll likely understand more of it once it arrives, which is slated for this month (May) in the U.S. Google says once its browse pages rollout, users can find them first for Media & Entertainment content.</p><p>Google expects to expand its coverage to more types of apps and content "later this year."</p><h2 id="play-store-users-and-devs-2">Play Store, Users, and Devs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:631px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.09%;"><img id="tr8D68FAAAEWTbNGDG6qvW" name="google-play-store-topic-browse-page" alt="Google's "topic browse page" will soon hit the Play Store, showing users multiple areas from within the store to increase engagement with Media & Entertainment apps at the start." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tr8D68FAAAEWTbNGDG6qvW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="631" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Engagement updates continue with Google's reported expansion of "Where to Watch." The post says users in Korea, Indonesia, the U.K., and Mexico will soon see it on the Play Store. In July, Google says more developers will have the ability to display a hero content carousel and even include YouTube videos in their store listings.</p><p>Rounding out the engagement updates is Google's "audio samples" on the Apps Home. Google says this should give users an (audible) way to experience what developers are offering first before diving in further. This will debut first for Health & Wellness content on the Play Store in the U.S. before expanding to other areas.</p><h2 id="more-for-developers-2">More for Developers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:969px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.92%;"><img id="yRx5Ya3WPf2fMN4zFQ4ZVP" name="google-play-store-halt-rollout" alt="Google's Production page in the Play Store shows a developer a way to "Halt" an update rollout if there are problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yRx5Ya3WPf2fMN4zFQ4ZVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="969" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>App development takes time, but Google looks to relieve the stress behind the management side with <em>more </em>actionable insights for devs. Specifically, Google says it will soon bring overview pages for the Grow and Monetize statistics for developers and their apps. Moreover, the company is working on bringing the ability for devs to "fully-halt" the rollout of an app's version if reports show it's causing more harm than good.</p><p>Another update makes it easier to upload, edit, and view app assets in the Play Store via the Asset Library. Google says developers can drag their content into their listings straight from Drive. It's update will even clue devs into how attractive their assets might be to users, which can feed into app engagement.</p><p>Google's also stepping up its security for developers creating apps. This concerns developers staying ahead of potential signs of abuse, protecting their app's "sensitive" actions, like transfers or data access.</p><h2 id="play-store-revenue-2">Play Store Revenue</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:211.27%;"><img id="RP3ya3XHvcninJzL9YUuzK" name="google-play-store-subscription-addons-one-price" alt="An example of how Google will let developers give users a subscription and all of its add-ons for one price, streamlining the process." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RP3ya3XHvcninJzL9YUuzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="284" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Subscriptions concern us all — developers and end-users alike. Google states it's looking to "streamline" the subscription process to build engagement. To get this done, the post says the Play Store will introduce "multi-product checkout for subscriptions." In short, developers can sell a subscription <em>and </em>its add-ons under one "aligned payment schedule." For users, they will see one price upon purchase that incorporates the subscription and its add-ons.</p><p>Developers will gain increased control over how users can upgrade their subscription, manage add-ons, or downgrade.</p><p>Moreover, subscribers will see the benefits they will receive by purchasing what a developer (app) is offering more clearly.</p><p>Google's focus on payments doesn't end there, as the post details another update. During a device's initial setup, Google says it will look to prompt users about setting up payment methods and verification. AI isn't taking a backseat on this, as the post highlights Google's models will be present to help developers "optimize" in-app transactions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It usually means game over, but with Google’s new “Flow” tool, you might not need any of those to bring your vision to life.</p><p>At its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-i-o-2025-live-blog">I/O conference</a>, Google announced Flow, a new AI setup built to help storytellers turn big ideas into movie scenes without blowing a ton of cash.</p><h2 id="powered-by-google-s-best-ai-2">Powered by Google’s best AI</h2><p>Flow is far from being just another video tool. It’s wired to work hand-in-hand with Google’s AI models. It taps into Veo 3 for video, Imagen 4 for images, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> for the smarts behind it all.</p><p>That setup lets you describe scenes in plain English, fine-tune camera angles, and keep characters consistent from shot to shot. It even handles sound effects and dialogue on its own.</p><h2 id="how-it-works-2">How it works</h2><p>With Flow, you just type something like "A detective chases a thief through a rainy Tokyo alley" and Veo 3 brings it to life, complete with footsteps, rain sounds, and cinematic lighting.</p><p>You can tweak camera angles, zoom in, or switch perspectives like you're behind the lens. Building scenes is as easy as stacking Legos—add shots, change angles, remix elements, and it all stays consistent. And if you ever hit a creative block, Flow TV lets you peek at what others are making (prompts included), so you can borrow ideas or put your own spin on things.</p><p>Flow is for anyone who wants to bring ideas to life without the heavy lift, such as social media creators chasing slick visuals without an editor, indie filmmakers testing out scenes before hitting record, or total beginners just messing around with AI to see what kind of movie magic they can pull off.</p><h2 id="rolling-out-now-u-s-first-2">Rolling out now (U.S. first)</h2><p>At present, Flow is rolling out to Google AI Pro and Ultra users in the U.S., with more countries getting access soon. Pro users get 100 generations a month, while Ultra subscribers unlock Veo 3’s advanced audio capabilities. That means your clips can come with ambient sounds, spoken lines, and perfectly timed pauses baked right in.</p><p>Google teamed up with seasoned filmmakers who put it to the test in real-world shoots.</p><p>Is this the future of filmmaking? Maybe. But for now, it’s just a seriously fun tool for anyone who’s ever wanted to direct their own little masterpiece.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Heston 120 marks its first official attempt at building something for the TV and home theater space, taking on the likes of Sonos, Sony, Samsung, Denon, and many others.</p><p>Built for both TV audio and music playback and selling for $999.99, Marshall’s first soundbar measures 43.3 x 5.70 x 2.99 inches (width x depth x height). It will work as a connected device, meaning you will be able to stream audio to it from your phone, tablet, or computer. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support, spatial audio is part of the mix as well.</p><h2 id="marshall-styling-and-tuning-2">Marshall styling and tuning</h2><p>The Heston 120 has 11 “strategically placed” drivers facing in different directions to spread sound out, much like other similar soundbars do. Marshall claims special effects will sound more “lifelike” while deep bass will give both TV audio and music a resonant rumble unto itself.</p><p>Not surprisingly, the brand references both explosions in an action film and the ambience of a live concert recording as key examples of what sets this new soundbar apart from others. Total peak output is 150 watts, so this thing can get pretty loud.</p><p>Marshall also ensures that the Heston 120 stays close to the family as far as how it looks. The wrapped leather trim and brushed metal panel are not unlike its existing speaker lineup, along with the metal knobs designed to emulate the look of an old school Marshall amp.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XQRL3CpSyPyX2eXs5Feoya" name="Marshall-Heston-120-angle" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar in black on a white background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XQRL3CpSyPyX2eXs5Feoya.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, the soundbar will have a form of modularity in that you can repair or replace the fret, end caps, drivers, and circuit boards to extend its lifespan in case anything malfunctions down the line. What’s not clear is how long Marshall intends to offer these replacement parts, especially if it chooses to exit the TV audio category later on.</p><p>The Heston 120 has an HDMI eARC port and HDMI pass-through for TVs and external devices, plus classic RCA analog inputs in case you want to try it with a turntable or legacy components. There’s even an output port for a subwoofer.</p><p>An Ethernet port enables wired access to the home network, though the soundbar can also connect via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (with LE Audio and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">Auracast</a> support) to stream music wirelessly.</p><h2 id="control-through-marshall-app-2">Control through Marshall app</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MM28DuJNbHSteXy58AmL9b" name="Marshall-Heston-120-controls" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar knobs and dials." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MM28DuJNbHSteXy58AmL9b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The retooled Marshall app lets you control the Heston 120 in much the same way as its other speakers. Settings and features appear to remain similar, where you can manage volume, adjust EQ settings, and customize sound profiles. The app will also offer room calibration to optimize the Heston 120’s acoustics and sound output for whatever space you put it in.</p><p>Outside of the app, Spotify, Tidal, and Airable internet radio will integrate into the app and connected devices as well. For example, the Heston 120 will appear as a streaming option in the Spotify and Tidal apps, along with preset buttons you can apply to it in the Marshall app for quick playback. This way, you can start a playlist or radio station without opening any of those three streaming apps. AirPlay 2 and Chromecast connections also apply here, adding another way to push content over to the soundbar.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DQc3iuphcJWSqNMqxyzuwa" name="Marshall-Heston-120-ports" alt="Marshall Heston 120 soundbar ports in the rear." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQc3iuphcJWSqNMqxyzuwa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marshall)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably missing in this layout is voice control. The two onboard microphones only serve the room calibration feature, so at least for now, you won’t be controlling smart home devices or telling the Heston 120 what you want to hear.</p><p>The Marshall Heston 120 goes on sale starting June 3, 2025 from Marshall.com, for $999.99. It only comes in black, and while you can wall-mount it, the mounts don’t come in the box, so you’ll have to buy them separately. Marshall will also release related products, called Heston 60 and Heston Sub 200 at a later unspecified date.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While that can be a sound strategy, it doesn't always get you the best value. There's no doubt the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> is a solid smartphone for $500, but it can quickly become overshadowed by the regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> at the right price.</p><p>Now that early Memorial Day deals are here, the base-model Pixel 9 has finally hit the perfect price. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R"><strong>It's 25% off at Amazon, bringing the cost under $600 and shaving nearly $200 off the usual sticker price.</strong></a></p><p>I've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">tested the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9a side-by-side for weeks</a>, and I'm absolutely certain it's worth paying an extra $100 for the full-fledged Pixel 9 instead of settling for the cheaper model.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9:" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="sodW7A8szEd5RSmMQMefhi" name="google-pixel-9-official-render-peony-back.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sodW7A8szEd5RSmMQMefhi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$799.00</del> <strong>$599.75 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Google Pixel 9 is a base-model flagship with everything you need in an Android phone, and it's now more accessible. Early Memorial Day deals bring the Pixel 9 down under $600, and that puts this outstanding device in the same category as budget midrangers like the Pixel 9a and OnePlus 13R. There's really no comparison — the Pixel 9 is a steal at this price point. </p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6587819.p?skuId=6587819" target="_blank">Best Buy - $799.99</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_9" target="_blank">Google Store - $799.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7HVCD8R" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f44fa6c6-cd27-4472-b61d-0b3a187999dc" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 9:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-memorial-day-sale-2025-best-android-deals"><em><strong>See the 20 best Android deals from Amazon's Memorial Day sale</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you value increased performance and on-device AI capabilities; you want a stylish and premium design; you need excellent nighttime photography.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're not willing to pay more than $500; you don't like an over-processed colors; you want the absolute best battery life.</p><p>It's easy to think that the Google Pixel 9a and the more-expensive Pixel 9 are too similar, as both have nearly-identical screens and the exact same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 processor</a>. However, there's more to the story. The budget Pixel 9a is the winner in battery capacity, but the more premium Pixel 9 takes the crown in just about every other area. For most people, it's absolutely worth paying only $100 more during this sale to upgrade to the standard Pixel 9.</p><h2 id="why-the-google-pixel-9-runs-laps-around-the-pixel-9a-2">Why the Google Pixel 9 runs laps around the Pixel 9a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-8" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVu8jzgzjBV9iosJsYV6jG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Pixel 9a (left) compared to the Pixel 9 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are subjective reasons you might want to pick the Pixel 9 over the Pixel 9a, like slimmer display bezels, a premium glass back, and the iconic Pixel camera bar. It's true that the Pixel 9 is the most premium-feeling Pixel generation I've ever used, but design differences are easy to overlook if you're trying to save a few dollars.</p><p>Putting those aside, the concerning part about buying a Pixel 9a for $500 is the phone's longevity. Google equipped the Pixel 9a with just 8GB of RAM, while the rest of the Pixel 9 series gets 12GB of memory. This decision inherently limits the Pixel 9a's potential. While it is guaranteed to get seven years of software support, it's reasonable to expect the cheaper model to miss out on new features due to hardware limitations.</p><p>In fact, the Pixel 9a is more limited than the Pixel 9 straight out of the box. The phone's smaller available memory means that it can only run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">the Gemini Nano XXS model</a> instead of the Gemini Nano XS model the Pixel 9 can handle. This has real-world consequences: you won't be able to use handy features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-call-notes-google-pixel">Call Notes</a> on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>These are just the feature omissions on day one, and there will be likely more to follow as Google ships more updates for Pixel phones. AI tasks specifically require a lot of memory for on-device processing, and the Pixel 9a can't handle these as well as the Pixel 9. By paying only $100 more for the Pixel 9 today, you're not just buying the features available today — you're future-proofing your device for all the ones guaranteed to arrive in future Android OS upgrades.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bu9HcA539bybvsYAzpPMaK" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-2" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bu9HcA539bybvsYAzpPMaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Google Pixel 9a (left) compared to the Pixel 9 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other benefits, like a 50MP main camera sensor that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">significantly larger the one offered on the Pixel 9a</a>, make the Pixel 9 a slam-dunk purchase at this price point. Keep in mind, the Pixel 9 costs around $800 at full price. When the smartphone is available at its full retail price, it's completely reasonable to save $300 to buy the Pixel 9a instead.</p><p>However, when the difference in price between the Pixel 9 and the Pixel 9a is only $100, it's a no-brainer. The flagship Pixel 9 is the better phone today, and it'll almost certainly last longer and get more new features, too.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="90343c4a-abd4-4fde-b241-5e9b0dc73b58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sodW7A8szEd5RSmMQMefhi.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 official render Peony"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Covering all the basics</strong></em></p><p>Want to get a flagship phone at midrange prices?

A big part of the allure with the brand is the styling; most of its products have a delightful retro aesthetic, and that's even more true of its mechanical keyboard.</p><p>The Retro Mechanical Keyboard has a fabulous design that evokes memories of retro gaming consoles, and 8BitDo did a great job staying true to its design ethos. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Bluetooth-Swappable-Programmable-PC/dp/B0CCP8KYGG">keyboard is available for $89 on Amazon</a>, and it is sold in four editions. I'm using the N Edition, and you can pick up the C64 Edition, Fami Edition, or the M Edition. The feature-set is identical with all the models, and the only difference is the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eAxj7Hnh47eBJA5b8REfeL" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eAxj7Hnh47eBJA5b8REfeL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4896" height="2758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The N Edition is styled to resemble the NES, and it looks fantastic; the design is a definite differentiator, and 8BitDo did all the right things in this area. The keyboard has a power button on the right that light up when it's connected, and you get dials to switch between modes; there's Bluetooth and 2.4GHz connectivity in addition to the standard USB-C.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6kxuLgSQSCVxvuC7enq5L" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6kxuLgSQSCVxvuC7enq5L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are physical buttons to pair the keyboard, and I set it up with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> in addition to testing it with my Windows machine. There are no problems whatsoever with connectivity, and 8BitDo's unique 2.4GHz receiver slots into a magnetic cubby at the back, ensuring you don't lose it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4928px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="asZqStKTjLP77MJJEFSEoK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asZqStKTjLP77MJJEFSEoK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4928" height="2775" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The keyboard uses an aluminum plate, but the chassis itself is made out of plastic. I don't mind the plastic build (it is a faithful recreation, after all), and the build quality itself is pretty good. Coming in at 1050g, the keyboard isn't particularly heavy, but it stays planted on a table thanks to rubber feet on the underside.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZhbrNBGscC7BqnN5hbxtvK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhbrNBGscC7BqnN5hbxtvK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the dual knobs to switch between modes and adjust the volume; they have a decidedly retro flair. The keys are similarly great, with 8BitDo using dye-sublimated PBT keys with a custom MDA profile. Another interesting inclusion is a set of buttons — dubbed the Super Buttons — that you can connect to the keyboard via custom connectors. You get one set of buttons in the package, and you can easily connect three additional sets. The buttons are programmable, so you can set up macros or launch a program with relative ease.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cMGwDWZX3bKq2tPJj4bSqK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMGwDWZX3bKq2tPJj4bSqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to most keyboards today, 8BitDo went with a TKL design — you miss out on the dedicated number pad.

Of course, you can easily take out the switches and use your own if you want — the keyboard takes standard 3- and 5-pin MX switches.

Outside of that, I don't have any problems with the Retro Mechanical Keyboard. The keyboard has a 2,000mAh battery, and 8BitDo touts 200 hours of usage between charges. That's because of the fact that it doesn't have any backlighting, and in my usage, I got two weeks of usage out of a charge, and that's considerably more than any other keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="DwiBf3xsntJk9nPJwkZKmK" name="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard" alt="8BitDo Retro Mechanical Keyboard review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwiBf3xsntJk9nPJwkZKmK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5092" height="2868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Retro Mechanical Keyboard has one of the best designs of any keyboard I have in the house (and I have over 30 boards), and the versatile connectivity makes it a breeze to use it with just about any device.

Its latest addition is the Maverick Mini, a 20,000mAh power bank with 20W charging. While that's pretty standard these days, what gives the Maverick Mini an edge is that it has built-in USB-C as well as Lightning cables.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pmFfDXWeFedF5PpbfkRvqU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pmFfDXWeFedF5PpbfkRvqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The power bank is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Maverick-Powerbank-Lightning-Charging/dp/B0DZHKBBM1">available for ₹2,299 ($27) on Amazon India</a>, and it's a decent value when you consider the design and build quality. The Maverick Mini is considerably smaller than the brand's traditional power banks like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-ultra-review">Major Ultra</a>, and in this regard, it takes after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-giga-is-the-indian-brands-best-65w-power-bank-yet">Giga 65W model</a>. The smaller size makes it that much easier to take anywhere, and at 322g, it isn't too heavy either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CLpUG4xBMaDKroWMrWk5tU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CLpUG4xBMaDKroWMrWk5tU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are no issues taking the 77Wh battery on a flight, and what I like the most about the Maverick Mini is the built-in cables; while I used several power banks that have an integrated USB-C cable, the inclusion of the Lightning cable is a nice addition, and it gives the power bank much better versatility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rGueG5spnKL7bsFE7T7zqU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rGueG5spnKL7bsFE7T7zqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You get two standard ports as well, a USB-C and USB-A, and the latter goes up to 22.5W and can be used to charge various phones and accessories. The power bank works with USB PD PPS at up to 22W, so if you've got a Samsung phone, this is a decent choice. Both the USB-C and Lightning ports go up to 20W individually, and while it isn't the fastest power bank by Stuffcool, you're basically getting plenty of convenience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="tWmzQtEuijEEPpoXAgcztU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tWmzQtEuijEEPpoXAgcztU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5110" height="2878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The internal battery charges at 18W, and it takes over two hours to charge. What's great in this area is that there's a tiny panel on the side that serves as the battery level indicator, and it definitely comes in handy. The build quality itself is pretty good, and I didn't see any issues in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LmwA3fCejmGtCSfVJ7sTxU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmwA3fCejmGtCSfVJ7sTxU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one quibble with the design is that the glossy coat picks up smudges with relative ease, and I would have liked a matte texture or better coating; UGREEN's Nexode power bank does a great job, but it's six times costlier. I used the power bank with the Vivo X200 Pro and Steam Deck, and it delivered a consistent charge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sm46YQYKWc4VtdTaZposrU" name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini" alt="Stuffcool Maverick Mini review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sm46YQYKWc4VtdTaZposrU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Affordability is a key selling point of the Maverick Mini, and the smaller size makes it easier to carry around in a bag. While I'm not using iPhones that still have the Lightning port, it is a good choice nonetheless, and it is just as consistent at charging as the USB-C port.</p><p>If you want a power bank that has integrated cables and a 20,000mAh battery, the Maverick Mini is a decent choice. A similar model with 65W charging would be a great addition to Stuffcool's portfolio, so let's see if the brand releases that next. Until then, the Maverick Mini is a good starting point.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="526eff8f-96b2-45ac-9a48-f36ad8b6f51e">            <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Maverick-Powerbank-Lightning-Charging/dp/B0DZHKBBM1" data-model-name="Stuffcool Maverick Mini"><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:110.03%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HjGXHqn5Ap8U4r9DaRZX2S.jpg' alt="Maverick Mini"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Stuffcool Maverick Mini</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Maverick Mini is a decent 20000mAh power bank, but the addition of Lightning and USB-C cables gives it a little bit of an advantage. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I liked what Synology did with the BeeStation; it delivered an easier-to-use network storage product that makes it easier for those looking to store photos and documents in a centralized location. WD's My Cloud catered to this category for close to a decade, so it was good to see Synology coming up with a rival.</p><p>The brand showcased the BeeStation Plus with 8TB of storage at the start of the year, and the model is now available globally. You can buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://B0F43Z4SBS">for $459 on Amazon in the U.S.</a> (with deliveries starting June 10), and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://bee.synology.com/en-uk/BeeStation/Plus-8TB">selling for £386 in the U.K.</a> via the brand's website. To put things into context, the regular BeeStation with 4TB storage is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Synology-BeeStation-Personal-Storage-BST150-4T/dp/B0CSSR38F1">available for $219</a>, so you're basically paying double.</p><p>What do you get for that price, you ask? The BeeStation Plus has double the amount of storage at 8TB, and the fact that it has an integrated HDD makes it that much more convenient. You get all the same features as the standard model, including an AI-backed photo management, and you get easy file management with the ability to connect to public cloud providers like Google Drive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.01%;"><img id="4qZ4oUBUM6cTpHTUjetFoH" name="Synology BeeStation Plus" alt="Synology BeeStation Plus render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4qZ4oUBUM6cTpHTUjetFoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="763" height="496" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Synology)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's not all though, as the BeeStation Plus also comes with a native Plex client. The ability to store TV shows and movies and stream them to all devices on your home network is a huge advantage, and this is a key omission on the regular BeeStation. So if you need a no-frills Plex media server that does the basics, the BeeStation Plus is a strong candidate.</p><p>The best part is that as the BeeStation Plus is powered by Intel's Celeron J4125 platform, you get hardware transcoding as well — something that's not available on the DiskStation DS923+. The product comes with 4GB of RAM installed as standard, and there's a single Gigabit Ethernet port alongside the usual USB-C and USB-A connectivity.</p><p>I'll be testing the BeeStation Plus in the coming weeks, but if you're just interested in a centralized storage solution with integrated Plex and 8TB of storage, this is looking like a pretty good deal.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3ad0e0d1-37e5-4e05-9e33-62acf35a1e48">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:74.73%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fF9G3yx3mXrCnSEd7RSBpH.jpg' alt="Synology BeeStation Plus render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Synology BeeStation Plus (8TB)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With 8TB of integrated storage and easy management of photos, documents, and the added ability to use it as a Plex media server, the BeeStation Plus is a worthy upgrade to the regular model. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Some people prefer to leave their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android smartphone</a> at home while running, hiking, and cycling. Others use an armband or a fancy hip belt, and a bunch do things the old fashioned way by using their hand or pockets to bring a phone along.</p><p>As a runner with a thousand-plus miles tracked with either a smartwatch or smartphone, I haven't found any of these options to be particularly satisfying. That is, until I started testing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a> — a clamshell foldable that's half the height of a normal Android smartphone when closed. Suddenly, holding a phone that fits comfortably in the palm of your hand isn't so bad on a long run.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mePs4vcSxHxAz5fXFMtsFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-20" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 showing an active run using the Nike Run Club app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mePs4vcSxHxAz5fXFMtsFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Often, the conversation about flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is that they come with a handful of compromises. These devices don't feature the same camera quality, durability, or battery capacity as traditional handsets, for example.</p><p>However, their compactness can be more of an advantage than a compromise, and that's what I learned using the Razr 2025 as a running buddy — one that added convenience <em>and</em> saved me money.</p><h2 id="all-the-benefits-of-carrying-a-phone-with-few-drawbacks-2">All the benefits of carrying a phone, with few drawbacks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="utNZwugWxm9BMYPk2XXhXK" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-25" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 showing the new run screen on the Nike Run Club app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/utNZwugWxm9BMYPk2XXhXK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The downsides to carrying your phone with you while working out are obvious. They're big and heavy, which can affect your balance and arm motion. If you end up dropping it, or it falls out of your pocket, that could be a $1,000 device hitting the pavement. With that being said, the risks of <em>not</em> carrying a phone with you could be more dangerous — there's no way to get hold of people in the event of an emergency.</p><p>That's why it's simply a good idea to have at least one LTE-enabled device with you while working out, whether it be a phone or a smartwatch. I use a variety of smartwatches to track my runs, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and the Apple Watch Ultra. The problem is that to use these devices with cellular, I'll need to pay an extra carrier fee that ends up coming out to $15 more per month on my AT&T plan.</p><p>Chances are, if you're a fitness-minded Android user, you probably have a smartwatch. You might even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatch-lte">have one with LTE connectivity</a>. But those extra costs add up, and I wanted to find out if there was a better way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uC3XEFqxredRCxRTznDNLT" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-18" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uC3XEFqxredRCxRTznDNLT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure enough, I'm convinced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> can be a more useful and cost-effective way to get LTE connectivity on your runs than paying for cell service on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatch</a>. With a tiny phone tucked in your waistband, pocket, or even held in your hand, you can get data on your phone and watch for zero extra dollars.</p><p>For me, carrying a flip phone along with my smartwatch created a better experience than using either a traditional smartphone or an LTE-enabled watch. You get all the benefits of having your phone with you, despite it being roughly half the size of a normal device. That means you can clutch it completely in the palm of your hand, or put it deep in your pockets to reduce bounce, and the risk of a phone falling out while moving.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZznN6TyJd5CaZ5rP6zbwxF" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-21" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 opened up on the Nike Run Club interface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZznN6TyJd5CaZ5rP6zbwxF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you can always open up the phone when you need it. That's the great part about the compact form factor of flip phones like the Razr or Galaxy Z Flip. They're small when you need something tiny, and offer the same screen size as a normal flagship when you need something bigger.</p><p>I've never been able to run comfortably carrying traditional smartphones — and I've tried ones from almost every brand — but using a flip phone changed my experience for the better. If you're a runner and carry an LTE-enabled smartwatch instead of your phone, switching to a clamshell foldable and ditching the extra LTE plan could save you money while improving utility.</p><h2 id="find-your-use-case-for-flip-phones-2">Find your use case for flip phones</h2><p>Running just happened to be the key use case that made clamshell foldables massively appealing to me, but chances are, it'll be different for you. Everyone is going to have their own reason for preferring the versatile form factor. Photographers and content creators might like having a built-in tripod wherever they go, and YouTube fans might love watching videos with a built-in phone stand.</p><p>The point is, if you're considering a compact foldable, get creative. Think about what killer use case that's personal to you might be made possible by the form factor. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable phones</a> can do a lot of things regular phones can't — like tagging along with me on a run without being a nuisance — and that's part of their appeal.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="745378c5-3dfa-4eca-819f-9855a3ae1643">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdWkC6F5EinhiN99YnWz7D.jpg' alt="Razr 2025 render in Spring Bud"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Razr 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The affordable flip phone</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is a stylish and versatile foldable phone with a large cover screen and a compact size (when closed) that's perfect for runners and anyone who likes small phones.</p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"></div>            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Can this ever be less of a problem?</p><p>The quick answer is that phones or other devices that use any sort of super-thin glass that folds will always be more fragile than ones that don't. No magic can change that, but they should be getting more durable every year — probably not for the reason you think, though.</p><p>The entire problem is the thin glass. To have glass that can bend over and over without breaking, it's got to be thinner than a human hair and treated with a special series of coatings. It's amazing, but by its very nature, it's also extremely fragile.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eZMbqLPJZHZ5vhMQoWS4WR" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-3-display-crease-screen-protector-damage-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3 screen protector wear and tear after 10 months' usage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eZMbqLPJZHZ5vhMQoWS4WR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">Making glass bend</a> is about a lot more than the glass.

A folding phone with a blemish on the glass will split right down the crease every time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XV23Wsd8DPotZ3goTWfteY" name="xiaomi-mix-fold-2-review-7.jpg" alt="Xiaomi MIX Fold 2 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XV23Wsd8DPotZ3goTWfteY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The solution is to do everything possible to keep the screen from being inadvertently damaged. That's why there's a plastic coating on the glass and a plastic permanent screen protector. It's also why foldable phones don't truly fold in half, and the two sides never touch. When all is said and done, though, the hinge is the single most important part of the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-titanium-hinge" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 titanium hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having all the plastic (which feels much better now than it did just a few years ago, because science) in place is easy to figure out. If a piece of dirt from your pocket weasels its way near the screen, it should scratch the plastic layer and leave the glass alone.</p><p>That's also why it's built so that the two sides don't meet when it's closed. You don't want the screen to rub against itself, so the phone folds a tiny bit less than 180 degrees, and there is a small lip around the edge of the phone's body.</p><p>This prevents tiny scratches. It's also why you should never push anything except the soft end of your finger onto a folding phone's screen; your fingernail or something hard could dent the glass through the plastic coatings. Yes, it's that thin.</p><p>But again, the most important and probably most difficult part of the design is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pete-lau-teasing-oneplus-fold">the hinge</a>. Imagine if a folding phone's hinge had a little bit of side-to-side wiggle, and what that would do to the edge of a really thin sheet of glass. It would cause a tear along the edge, and that spells the end of the line for your display in short order.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-28" alt="A side view of the Motorola Razr 2025 hanging off a park bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gfr9eqkpTKvJ8MzSobiY7Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the flip side (see what I did there?) the hinge has to be easy to operate the way it should. it has to fold smoothly without much force yet stay rigidly in place when it is open. Any movement can create a tiny crack that kills your foldable.</p><p>Nobody seems to appreciate the work being done here enough, except the people doing it. The hinge design is 100% why you can have a folding phone in the first place, and as they get better, reports of busted screens become less common — remember the first Galaxy Z Fold and all the pictures on social media of broken ones?</p><p>Foldables will never be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">MIL-SPEC tough</a> or rugged devices, and we probably wouldn't even want a thick, bulky 20-ounce phone anyway. But they are getting better and will keep getting better as more work is done to keep everything moving only the way it's supposed to move.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The clue dropped in a YouTube video where the design team broke down what they’re after, though they’re still keeping the name a mystery.</p><p>The teaser is fresh off Nothing's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://international.kef.com/blogs/news/nothing-kef-audio-partnership" target="_blank">team-up with audio gear company KEF</a>. The London-based company is mum on the specs for now, but it's a safe bet that we can expect the headphones to arrive this summer.</p><p>Although Nothing is silent about the details for its first over-ear headphones, teaming up with KEF tells us one thing: these will definitely be its most expensive audio gear yet.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyrrLa2zdLg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Still, a few standout hints slipped through. In the teaser’s opener, the design crew jokes about the tag “XM6," a cheeky nod to Sony’s word-salad title for its premium headphones, the WH-1000XM6.</p><p>So, it looks like Nothing is gunning for high-end sound but keeping the price tag down where regular consumers can still snag a pair.</p><h2 id="no-more-button-fumbles-2">No more button fumbles</h2><p>While riffing on Sony’s new WH-1000XM6, Nothing’s design crew didn’t pull punches, basically saying most over-ear headphones out there are a yawn when it comes to looks. The company also side-eyed the wallet-busting price tags and how you end up fumbling for buttons once the cans are clamped on your head.</p><p>Nothing’s designers want these over-ears to sort of shout your style the second you put them on. They’re dialing in the feel-by-touch controls so you always hit the right button blind.</p><h2 id="sound-that-clowns-pricier-pairs-2">Sound that clowns pricier pairs</h2><p>More importantly, Nothing is promising sound that punches way above its price class and, maybe, even embarrasses a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">fan-favorite wireless headphones</a>.</p><p>When price came up, one designer mouthed the number, but Nothing bleeped the sound and blurred their lips.

The change is becoming available following a Google Play Store update for the app, which was previously named Find My Device. Find Hub better reflects the app's capabilities, as it can track devices, items, and people.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.adm&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store listing</a> now reflects the name change, so you'll need to search for Find Hub to update your app. The latest version number for Find Hub is <strong>3.1.337-2</strong>, and after applying the update, you'll see the switch. Google used to shorten Find My Device to Find Device on the home screen, but now Find Hub is used everywhere.</p><p>Alongside the tweak, the <strong>People</strong> tab in the Find Hub app is out of beta following a testing period. You'll now see separate settings pages for Find Hub and Google Location Sharing when tapping your profile picture in the app after updating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Xh9pnjKDzNHVACmk5XcaWP" name="Google-Find-Hub-Screenshots" alt="The Google Find Hub update rolling out on the Play Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xh9pnjKDzNHVACmk5XcaWP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/find/" target="_blank">official website</a> still uses the Find My Device branding rather than the newer Find Hub moniker.</p><p>These minor changes are just the start of Find Hub updates set to arrive on Android devices.

After using older Razr flagships and the multiple Samsung Galaxy Z Flip generations, I'm convinced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> is all the foldable you need.</p><p>Starting at just $700, you can pick up a Razr 2025 for way less than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> while still feeling like you're getting a premium experience. I've spent nearly two weeks with the newest entry-level Motorola foldable, and I already know I can comfortably keep this phone in my pocket for the long haul.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-2025-price-and-availability"><span>Motorola Razr 2025: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k9mxez6CvhSJrUeCP78bKZ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-29" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 in the Pantone Lightest Sky colorway hanging from a park bench." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k9mxez6CvhSJrUeCP78bKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is widely available for purchase in the U.S. and Canada as of May 15, 2025.

The two phones' dimensions are nearly identical, with the newer model being slightly thinner, slightly shorter, and slightly lighter. The design changes made to the Razr 2025 are so minute that older cases will still fit — we're talking about fractions of a millimeter here.</p><p>So, what's new about the Razr 2025? There are some new colors and finish options, and I tested Pantone Lightest Sky, which is an ivory-like colorway with a refractor design. However, the major design improvements are under-the-hood upgrades you won't be able to see.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-8" alt="A close-up of the Motorola Razr 2025's main display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5W3kTBBVmohVQc4hcp486c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The big news is that the Razr's dust-resistance rating is back after the 2024 series' IPX8 certification forewent dust protection. Now, the Razr 2025 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">IP48 certified</a> against dust and liquid ingress, and that's massive for durability. Dust-resistance is specifically important for foldables, since any kind of debris getting in the hinge or under the display could be fatal for your device.</p><p>The other key design upgrade goes hand-in-hand with the IP48 rating, and that's the titanium-reinforced hinge. Past Motorola foldables utilized a stainless steel hinge, and it simply wasn't good enough compared to foldables from the likes of Samsung. Now, the hinge feels sturdier, stronger, and more satisfying to open and shut. Compared to the weaker hinge on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a>, the difference is night and day.</p><div ><table><caption>Motorola Razr 2025 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Motorola Razr 2025</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (Hello UX)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (internal)</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch, AMOLED, FHD+, 413ppi, LTPO 120Hz, HDR10+, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (external)</p></td><td  ><p>3.6-inch, pOLED, 413ppi, LTPS 90Hz, 1,700 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB LPDDR4X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB UFS 2.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.7, 0.8μm, 12.6MP Quad Pixel Technology, 1.6μm, Instant all-pixel PDAF, OIS, Pantone Validated Color and Skin Tones</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>13MP ultrawide, f/2.2, 120° FOV, 1.12 μm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (f/2.4, 0.7μm) or 8MP (f/2.4, 1.4um) Quad Pixel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics, dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP48</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,500mAh, 30W wired charging, 15W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (open)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 171.30 x 7.25mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (closed)</p></td><td  ><p>73.99 x 88.08 x 15.85mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>188g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, Pantone Lightest Sky</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>There aren't any other design changes to speak of, but that's not a bad thing. The base-model Razr's design was already solid. The 3.6-inch pOLED panel is plenty bright, and let's be honest, anything more than the 90Hz refresh rate supported by the cover screen would be overkill. On the inside, the 6.9-inch AMOLED is gorgeous with a 120Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>The foldable display crease is still visible, and it might feel odd to slide your finger across it for the first time. But that awkwardness fades away quickly.

There are at least four AI suites offered on this smartphone: Moto AI, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, Perplexity, and Copilot. If you don't want to use any of these AI features, that's perfectly fine. The Moto AI features require a Motorola account, so just stay signed out if you'd rather not see them. Plus, it's quick and easy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/first-things-to-do-with-the-motorola-razr-2025-series">change the double-press of the home button</a> from an AI launcher to a camera launcher.</p><p>I personally didn't enjoy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI experience</a> on the Razr 2025, mostly because the device is too underpowered to process AI queries in a fast and secure manner. For instance, Catch Me Up — a feature that summarizes your notifications — needs to send them to a cloud server for processing before you can get the low-down on what you missed. Not only is the delay inconvenient, the cloud processing could be a privacy concern.</p><p>For what it's worth, Motorola says data sent to its cloud servers is always encrypted, and that data won't be shared with third-party AI assistant apps. That won't be enough for everyone to trust the service, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3FT83QnWjw7H8QhFmJNMkD" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-4" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 showing the tape music player interface on a blue post." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FT83QnWjw7H8QhFmJNMkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The cover screen on the Motorola Razr 2025 is noticeably smaller than the Plus and Ultra variants. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You should know that it's incredibly easy to use the Razr 2025 without ever touching an AI feature, so these criticisms shouldn't be a dealbreaker. The truth is, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> is an excellent AI assistant, and it's all I need.

It covers just three years of Android OS upgrades and an extra year of security updates. That's short compared to other phones in this price range from Google and Samsung. Motorola's track record of shipping timely and bug-free software updates isn't great, either, although it has improved some as of late.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5FYDUXz8eP9YYzAarctvL6" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-15" alt="An angled view of the Motorola Razr 2025's hinge and cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5FYDUXz8eP9YYzAarctvL6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The camera lenses protrude quite a bit from the display, collecting dust and pocket lint. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My final nitpick is that the rear camera lenses are a dust and fingerprint magnet due to how far they protrude from the screen.

It's already discounted to $600, and will only get cheaper. Usually, I'd recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">picking up the older model</a> and saving a few bucks, but not this time. By picking the Razr 2024, you'll get one fewer OS upgrade (since the first was used for Android 15), no dust resistance, a smaller battery, and a weaker hinge. The savings aren't worth what you'd have to give up.</p><p>If you have a Razr Plus 2023 or older, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-makes-me-and-my-razr-plus-2023-jealous">the base Razr 2025 will surprisingly be worth the upgrade</a>.

Motorola's sketchy track record with software updates concerns me, and the three-year OS update promise falls short of modern expectations. Moto AI might not be as secure as you'd like, and the cover screen is less capable than the one you'll find on a Plus or Ultra model.</p><p>When all is said and done, I think all these points are forgivable when you consider the Razr 2025's affordable price of entry. Paying $700 or less for a phone sure to last you <em>at least</em> four years is a pretty solid deal. Even if you have the money to spend on a more expensive phone, the Razr 2025 finds a value sweet spot. None of the missing features from the Plus 2025 or Ultra 2025 variants significantly hamper the experience.</p><p>If I had carte blanche to choose a clamshell foldable, I'd choose the Motorola Razr 2025 because of its stellar price-to-performance ratio.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="eb0d9afd-6029-40de-9bf6-02da1974ae46">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2XVBN8WLRp2UjDjqKCNK9C.jpg' alt="Razr 2025 render in Lightest Sky"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Razr 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best value foldable</strong></em></p><p>There are just enough upgrades here to make the Motorola Razr 2025 an excellent value, even compared to the last-gen Razr 2024, which is sure to see discounts.

Veteran developers and VR publisher Creature just debuted four brand new games in its Creature Feature showcase on IGN, plus a handful of other titles that you will be looking forward to once you see them.</p><p>While most of these games are VR-only, two of them are also making their debut on non-VR systems in the very near future. But all of them are playable on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a>, which means all you'll need to do is wishlist these and get excited for the future!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-adepts-arena"><span>Adepts Arena</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mdIuP15NW4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Seemingly, everyone loves the Nintendo classic Avatar: The Last Airbender cartoon series, and Adepts banks on that feeling of nostalgia and elemental charm to immediately draw players into its gorgeous world. But you won't be The Avatar in this game. Rather, you're a powerful Earth Adept soldier who can unearth the rocks all around them in martial combat.</p><p>As you progress through the story, you'll unlock new powers as you achieve mastery over your earth powers. Adepts Arena is a single-player adventure, despite what the name might imply, so no PvP earth bending action just yet.</p><p>This one is debuting on the Meta Quest in VR (obviously), but is also going to be available on Steam with VR and flat screen support. Non-VR Steam gamers will control it like a traditional FPS, while VR gamers are treated to an immersive, active martial arts-style simulation. If you've ever wanted to weave the ways of the Earth Benders from Avatar, this is looking to be your best bet when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://giantstridegames.com/adepts-arena_en.php">hopefully debuts later this year</a>!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-deadly-delivery"><span>Deadly Delivery</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qf-gsoj2NgA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Next up is a multiplayer-focused co-op horror game that'll keep you running as fast as possible through haunted mines in an effort to try to deliver as many packages as possible. You and up to three other human-controlled goblins will take on dangerous shifts to deliver packages come Hell or high water. Hey, no one said being a Prime delivery person was easy!</p><p>Of course, things aren't as straightforward as delving down and dropping packages at doorsteps. Traps are laid along the way to prevent intruders of all kinds, and not all goblins are the nice kind, either. This is the game I'm most excited about in the whole showcase, as I'm just imagining all the fun I'll be having with friends on a Friday evening.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/deadly-delivery/8778947438836641/">Meta Quest page</a> for more info and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadlydelivery.com/">the official website</a> to sign up for the closed beta!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-crossings"><span>Crossings</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8tCL2k_l9ew" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/you-should-play-more-video-games-with-your-kids">Dungeons of Eternity</a> is one of my favorite VR games of all time, but wouldn't it be nice to get a change of scenery every once in a while? Crossings, a new game by the folks who brought us the Budget Cuts series — some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Quest games</a> ever — are back with a new co-op action-adventure roguelite that'll test your skills with the blade in a way I've only ever seen from the VR classic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/until-you-fall-review">Until You Fall</a>.</p><p>As you'd expect from a roguelite, each level and area is procedurally generated to deliver a new experience every time. Unlike most roguelites, however, your only goal isn't just to become stronger. In Crossings, you'll delve into a story of the Norse afterlife, finding hidden stories and rebuilding the memory of your lost village. In essence, it sounds more like a mix of Hades story-heavy quest and the near-storyless world of Dungeons of Eternity rolled into one title.</p><p>Crossings can be played single-player or with friends, ensuring that you can enjoy the game even if your friends aren't available. A demo is coming to Steam Next Fest in June with a full release on Steam and Meta Quest later this year.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-wordbound"><span>Wordbound</span></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7P-21uGiyV0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Have you ever thought about how you could make the word "rose" from the word "rooster?" Or maybe turning the word "pineapple" into two different words, "apple" and "pen?" It's these strange questions that keep us up at night that led to the creation of Wordbound, a fantastic new mixed reality word game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kettle.games/">coming soon to the Meta Quest platform</a>.</p><p>Each level features a visual puzzle that needs to be solved by deconstructing the available objects into their letters, then rearranging them into the solution object. In one scene, a bowl of three apples needs a fourth to be full, so you deconstruct a plane and a pig, sort the letters, then smash them together to make an apple.

It will be a two-day summit held between Sept. 23 and 25 in Hawaii (first reported by<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-confirms-late-September-launch-for-Snapdragon-8-Elite-2.1019401.0.html"> Notebook Check</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, "there's a good chance we could see the next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Snapdragon-X-Elite-2-New-rumour-predicts-up-to-a-22-performance-uplift.999825.0.html">Snapdragon X Elite 2</a> (or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Snapdragon-X2-Elite-Leak-reveals-chip-with-18-cores-48-GB-RAM-and-support-for-graphics-cards.971101.0.html">Snapdragon X2 Elite</a>) laptop chips debut here."</p><p>Several rumors that we saw around April this year also indicated that Qualcomm is working on a "Snapdragon 8 Elite 2," and its reveal could occur earlier toward the end of September.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.44%;"><img id="XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjRF5FYu5b2mruEqArEGQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 is expected to be more potent than the first-generation chipset. The website adds that it will keep its 6 + 2 CPU configuration and use an Adreno GPU that is up to 30% faster and has a 26% higher AnTuTu score.</p><p>It is important to note that despite having a rumored same "internal schedule" to launch the chip, the second-gen Elite is expected to show up a month earlier than its predecessor, which was launched in October last year.</p><p>Other rumors have indicated that the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could achieve 5GHz speeds for its main core and is tipped to come with Qualcomm's "enhanced Pegasus cores." The chip may come paired with the Adreno 840 GPU for a strong gaming experience, as well as LPDDR6 RAM support.</p><p>Smartphones powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 are expected to launch in October 2025.

If it's not already open, users can access this by clicking the hamburger menu icon at the top left corner. Now, from there, users will find a small, new magnifying glass. Gemini opens its "Search History" page with a search bar near its center.</p><p>If you know what you're looking for, or a keyword, you can input it there and Gemini will produce what it's found after a brief moment.</p><p>The number of results is stated right beneath the bar. What's more, every instance of the keyword or topic you've searched for will be highlighted in the results. The highlighted portion is simply pulled from whatever Gemini's response was to your old search, which is made apparent as it acts as the title for each result.</p><p>When clicking, users are quickly taken to that old chat with Gemini to see everything they've discussed in full.</p><h2 id="gemini-s-recent-history-2">Gemini's Recent History</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.94%;"><img id="kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX" name="google-gemini-search-history-example" alt="A screenshot of Gemini's "Search History," which will deliver results based on your search about older chats for rediscovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuYG9UXNCbYGTGqo7TxYjX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="924" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini would already show a variation of your chat history with it in the side panel. Under "Recent," users could see a handful of old chats, and clicking "Show More" would act as expected. However, this view is quite limited, meaning if you interact with Gemini often, you're going to miss those really old chats.</p><p>We've noticed Gemini's search function on our end, so users should begin noticing it more and more today and through the week.</p><p>Gemini's Search History introduction is wrapped in Google's previous string of more "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-free-version-now-supports-saved-info-for-personalized-responses">personalized</a>" updates for the AI model experience. Earlier this year, Google rolled out an update for Gemini Advanced that saves your information. This information encompasses whatever you've given the AI, like if you're a vegetarian, if you'd prefer responses in a different language, what your profession is, and more.</p><p>All of this is retained, so you don't have to reiterate these key points later. This is an opt-in option. If you don't want Gemini to remember things about you, it doesn't have to.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">a major update about Gemini</a> in March, which also touched on becoming more personal for users. This additional bit of personalization is powered by the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model, bringing your other apps into the model. From there, Google says Gemini <em>can </em>leverage your behavior in Search and other areas to "tailor" its responses in a way that fits you.</p><p>Still, users remain in control and can disable this function if preferred.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The program specializes in condensing lengthy, chunky pieces of research into more bite-sized, manageable notes for users. With it rolling out on the Play Store, Google highlights users' ability to "create and view" notebooks on the go. NotebookLM becomes "an expert" on the topics you feed it.</p><p>Its app details state it will "summarize them" (your notes) and make "interesting connections," which are all things it does on its desktop and mobile website.</p><p>A major highlight of the NotebookLM Android app is the inclusion of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>. Instead of reading through what the AI has condensed, AI Overviews creates a radio talk show-like experience with two AI hosts that deliver the information to you. Moreover, the AI's discussion will still feature those unique connections, just in a conversational format. Details state users can "join" those discussions, likely to put forward their questions vocally.</p><p>Alternatively, if you're reading through NotebookLM's summary, users can type their questions and receive "answers with in-line citations."</p><h2 id="notebooklm-s-journey-2">NotebookLM's Journey</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:273px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:219.78%;"><img id="Bj9oyPUHCpKeotNrhX8jYe" name="notebooklm-android-play-store-debut" alt="A screenshot of NotebookLM's home screen with various notebooks ready for the user to dive into on Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bj9oyPUHCpKeotNrhX8jYe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="273" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play Store)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:274px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.98%;"><img id="XC2knMwCVNNaKfosXj2cgi" name="notebooklm-android-upload-sources" alt="A snapshot of NotebookLM's "add a source" menu on Android, asking for PDF, website link, YouTube link, or copied text." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XC2knMwCVNNaKfosXj2cgi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="274" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play Store)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google drew attention to Android users' ability to quickly share files in the NotebookLM app. For example, if you've got a PDF handy that you've found, users can "share" it and find the NotebookLM logo there as an option. This will easily bring it into the AI's domain, where it will begin to deconstruct it, summarizing key points for talking points later.</p><p>The app has appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.labs.language.tailwind">on the Play Store</a> today (May 19); however, it's unclear if/when it will arrive on the App Store for iOS.</p><p>Late last year, Google updated NotebookLM's Audio Overviews, bringing users on a desktop an easier way to "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">guide</a>" its AI hosts. This arrived via a "customize" button, letting users choose what the AI should focus on. This gives users a way to ensure the AI is talking about the points they're most interested in, rather than unnecessarily rambling on about every minute detail.</p><p>Google also included support for background listening, making it even easier for users to listen as they go.</p><p>It seems the company couldn't wait to debut NotebookLM on Android after it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-gets-gemini-2-5-flash-as-it-prepares-to-launch-as-a-standalone-app">confirmed as much</a> earlier in May. During that announcement, the app picked up Gemini 2.5 Flash integration to enable multi-step reasoning capabilities. To explain, 2.5 Flash should give NotebookLM more "comprehensive answers" when users ask complex questions. The company's update included an Output Language setting, too, letitng users decide what language they'd prefer to receive answers in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, the product portfolios of these companies comprise some truly premium devices as well, with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Xiaomi Mix Flip being two such products.</p><p>Both are flip-style foldables that come with just about everything you could possibly want in a top-tier smartphone, including powerhouse hardware, feature-laden software with lots of AI-based tools, and much more. While the Razr Ultra 2025 is Motorola's latest and most expensive product of its kind, the Mix Flip is Xiaomi's first offering in the clamshell foldable segment and is nearly a year old at this point. The former is also much easier to get your hands on, whereas the latter remains limited in terms of availability. So, the question is, which of these two foldables is overall a better option?</p><p>Let's take a comparative look at the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip and find out.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-design-displays-and-hardware-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Design, displays, and hardware</h2><p>Motorola has been making foldables for a while now, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> is its finest offering yet. The smartphone's back panel comes in three different finishes (vegan leather, Alcantara, and wood) and there are four colors to choose from. You also get a titanium-reinforced hinge for improved durability, as well as an IP48 certification for better ingress protection.</p><p>The cover display is a 4.0-inch LTPO pOLED panel that comes with a refresh rate of up to 165Hz and is secured with a layer of Corning's Gorilla Glass Ceramic. The inner folding display is a 7.0-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also has a 165Hz refresh rate and can hit a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3995px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-24" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 next to a small vase with a plant inside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nryK77vyP4WrEKFpih5vHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3995" height="2247" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi has done a fabulous job with the Mix Flip, which doesn't look and feel like a first-generation product at all. You get an aluminum frame and a dual-link hinge that can hold the device open at multiple angles for capturing photos. The smartphone is available in two colors (Black and Purple), but there's no ingress protection rating.</p><p>The 4.01-inch AMOLED cover display features a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and is protected by Xiaomi's Shield Glass. As for the inner folding screen, it's a 6.86-inch LTPO AMOLED screen that also comes with a refresh rate of 120Hz and can achieve up to 3000 nits of peak brightness.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Category</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Xiaomi Mix Flip</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Closed: 88.1 x 74.0 x 15.7 mm, Opened: 171.5 x 74.0 x 7.2 mm</p></td><td  ><p>Closed: 85.5 x 74.0 x 16.0 mm, Opened: 167.5 x 74.0 x 7.6 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material(s)</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium-reinforced hinge, Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic (Cover display), IP48 certification</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless-steel hinge, Xiaomi Shield Glass (Cover Display), No IP rating</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>199g</p></td><td  ><p>192g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Outer)</p></td><td  ><p>4.0-inch pOLED, 1080x1272 pixels resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 3000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>4.01-inch AMOLED, 1208x1392 pixels resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 3000 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display (Inner)</p></td><td  ><p>7.0-inch LTPO AMOLED, 1224x2912 pixels resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 4500 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>6.86-inch LTPO AMOLED, 1224x2912 pixels resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, 3000 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>16GB & 512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB & 256GB/512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint reader (side-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint reader (side-mounted), Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Proximity, Ambient Light</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Dual-SIM 5G, NFC, GPS, and USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, Dual-SIM 5G, NFC, GPS, and USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Other Features</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, Smart Connect</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo speakers, IR blaster</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh, 68W wired charging, 30W wireless charging, 5W reverse charging</p></td><td  ><p>4,780mAh, 67W wired charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras (Primary)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 50MP (ultrawide), OIS, 8K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 50MP telephoto (2x optical zoom), OIS, 8K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera (Selfie)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP (wide-angle), 4K video recording</p></td><td  ><p>32MP (wide-angle), 4K video recording</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS & Update Policy</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (preinstalled), 3 years of OS and 4 years of security updates</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (preinstalled), 4 years of OS and 5 years of security updates</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Color Options</p></td><td  ><p>Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, Cabaret</p></td><td  ><p>Black, Purple</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Now let's talk about the internals. Being the newer product, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is powered by Qualcomm's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, working in tandem with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. Conversely, the Xiaomi Mix Flip features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC under the hood, along with 12GB of RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage.</p><p>Although the Razr Ultra 2025 does have a slight edge over the Mix Flip due to its better innards, both devices have hardware specifications comparable to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there. Consequently, they can handle even the most resource-intensive of tasks with little to no effort.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi" name="xiaomi-mix-flip-40" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip half folded against a purple background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kgb6cQ9v3WoAUFGtAanwHi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The two foldables are matched pretty evenly in terms of connectivity and I/O, with both offering features like Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, multi-band 5G support, and NFC. However, since the Xiaomi Mix Flip isn't officially available in the United States (and many other regions around the world), the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is going to have better carrier compatibility.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-software-cameras-and-battery-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Software, cameras, and battery</h2><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 runs Android 15 out of the box, with Motorola's Hello UI overlay. Even though the software experience is still fairly minimal, there are several thoughtful additions that take it to the next level, with 'Moto AI' being the most notable of them. As the name suggests, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> is the company's own suite of AI-powered tools that work alongside Google's Gemini. These include Image Studio and Playlist Studio, which can be used to generate images and create contextual music playlists.</p><p>The cover screen functionality has also gotten a bit better. You can not only use apps natively on the cover display but also set up shortcuts for in-app functions, configure widgets, and more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-15" alt="Look & Talk on the Razr Ultra 2025 listening for a voice" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTNrVFTitJGmdSUchw23QB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Running Android 14 with Xiaomi's HyperOS overlay, the Mix Flip comes with its own collection of AI-based features that are aimed at enhancing the overall user experience. Some of these tools include an AI Interpreter (for real-time translation of calls), AI Notes (for automatic formatting and summarization of notes), AI Film (for creating short cinematic videos). Of course, Google's AI features (e.g., Circle to Search) are also bundled. HyperOS comes with extensive customization options, including pet lock screens, dynamic widgets, and more.</p><p>While the Razr Ultra 2025 is set to receive three years of OS and four years of security updates, the Mix Flip will get four years of OS and five years of security updates. This update policy isn't really bad, but it doesn't match up to what you get with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> from companies like Samsung and Google.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Xiaomi Mix Flip unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vzdGhqQuamcr8SWEimpYTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to cameras, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a dual-lens primary camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP ultrawide unit. Thanks to Motorola's collaboration with Pantone, you can expect fabulous photos with good dynamic range and vibrant colors, even in dimly lit environments.</p><p>The Xiaomi Mi Flip features a dual-lens primary camera setup as well, with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP telephoto module with 2x optical zoom. While the lack of an ultrawide lens is a bit of a bummer, Xiaomi's association with Leica means that the photos are packed with detail and you have a lot of fun image styles to play with.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 features a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W fast charging support. As for the Mix Flip, it has a slightly bigger 4,780mAh battery with 67W wired charging support. While these specs are almost identical, the Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with wireless charging (30W) support, whereas the Mix Flip doesn't.</p><h2 id="motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-xiaomi-mix-flip-which-should-you-buy-2">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Xiaomi Mix Flip: Which should you buy?</h2><p>There's no denying that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Mix Flip are among the best foldable phones out there. Both these devices not only represent the best that Motorola and Xiaomi have to offer, but also prove that foldable smartphones are here to stay. They come with a similar set of features, and at the same time, have their own share of pros and cons too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-review-01" alt="Charging the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a389ZQT3F2vYsXAzLnZHcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3979" height="2238" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a starting price of $1,299, the Razr Ultra 2025 packs top-of-the-line hardware, a laundry list of AI-based tools, an all-day battery life, and incredible cameras. It's fairly expensive, but buying one is simple and network compatibility (with both mainstream and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carriers</a>) is almost guaranteed. On the other hand, the Mix Flip can be had for a starting price as low as $899, but you'll most likely have to import it. And even if you do, you'll have to do some research to ensure whether it'll work with your wireless carrier or not. Nonetheless, it's an amazing product that comes with a great design, thoughtful software additions, and versatile cameras. So, which one should you ultimately go for?</p><p>Here's what we recommend! If you simply need a flagship foldable that ticks almost all the right boxes and don't mind paying a premium for it, go ahead and get the Razr Ultra 2025. However, if you're willing to go the import route and know how to check for things such as carrier compatibility, you can go for the Mix Flip and save at least $400, if not more.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3c0fe1ce-c460-4494-8f71-40a67a3ab447">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aifRv86khpxust8RJY2qKj.jpg' alt="motorola razr ultra 2025 square render 1"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Top of the heap</strong></em></p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is undeniably the most powerful flip-style foldable available out there.

However, rumors point to it being improved so it could have an IP58 or IP68 rating. This would make it the only foldable to achieve this level of dust-proofing, if Samsung manages this feat.</p></article></section><h2 id="getting-a-higher-ip-rating-continues-to-be-a-huge-challenge-with-foldables-2">Getting a higher IP rating continues to be a huge challenge with foldables</h2><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and the Z Flip 6 were the only two foldables for a while to sport an IP48 rating. This was a big achievement for foldables and Samsung led the charge on this. An IPX8 rating which guarantees protection against only liquids, was also something Samsung pioneered. The first number in the rating denotes protection against solid particles, and the higher it goes (up to 6) the better the device is able to stay protected against much smaller solid particles or dust.</p><p>An IP48 rating ensures the device can survive ingress of solid particles larger than 1mm, which technically isn't dust. For that, we need an IP58 or IP68 rating, which is the gold standard. Going by the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931">leaks and rumors</a> surrounding the Galaxy Z Fold 7, all we know is that it's expected to have "improved dust and water resistance." This technically means we should be expecting a higher IP rating, at least for the dust part of it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKDTTyRwiSSteTZzDkjoq6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sealing off a foldable from water and dust is immensely challenging since there's a massive hinge to contend with, which contains multiple moving parts and intricate mechanisms. Finding a way to block dust from entering the small gaps can be very tricky. We have no doubt Samsung has been working on a way to make its foldables properly IP68-rated one day, but whether that'll happen with the Z Fold 7 remains to be seen.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is going to be yet another expensive foldable but having a higher IP rating would certainly set it apart from the rest, and maybe even convince existing Z Fold users to upgrade. We don't know for sure how secure the Fold 7 will be against dust and water, but you can be certain that it will have an IP48 rating as the bare minimum, if not better.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><u><em>Ultimate Guide</em></u></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8534c04f-2db7-42a9-9b7f-e8f8a27243b6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3TBpG5xrBdBccYddbWTo5Z.jpg' alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Replacement incoming</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 will soon be replaced by the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but other than the slimmer design and a few spec improvements, it's not expected to be drastically different.

Using the Ask Music feature, you can provide a simple prompt to create a custom station based on your mood, interests, genre, or even a specific event, like a themed party or gathering. Once you get started, you can continue the conversation to further refine the playlist so it’s absolutely perfect.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-ai-generated-radio-stations-on-youtube-music-2">How to create AI-generated radio stations on YouTube Music</h2><p>1.

On the Home screen, scroll down to the <strong>Ask for music</strong> section and enter your text command in the <strong>“Ask way you like” field</strong> or <strong>tap the microphone </strong>and speak what you want. Enter a prompt like “smooth jazz for a relaxing date night” or “upbeat tunes for a cardio workout.” In this example, we chose “UK Punjabi songs.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhesULZuxKeRnHGisaHrUK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>3. The station should automatically start playing. Otherwise, you can tap the <strong>“Adjust or ask again”</strong> field or the microphone to add refinements to the radio. There are also suggestion bubbles you can choose from to get more of what you want, like, in this example, “More traditional Punjabi music,” “Similar artists from India,” or "latest Bollywood tracks."</p><p>4. Once you’re happy with the playlist, you can <strong>Shuffle play, Save to playlist, Delete radio</strong>, or <strong>Pin to Speed dial</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK" name="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" alt="YouTube Music AI-generated radio stations" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N6otaivVf62gJcfeTkRUTK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-do-ai-generated-radio-stations-work-2">How do AI-generated radio stations work?</h2><p>You might be wondering how this magic happens. The feature uses the power of generative AI. It can take into account the types of music and artists you traditionally love to play and help you discover new music. It can also find music based on your specific command, like tunes of a specific genre, songs or artists from a specific country, or music with a tempo that fits an overall vibe.</p><p>Your prompts will help it further refine until you get exactly what you want. Once set up, your custom playlist can last the entire duration of a summer barbecue with friends, plus the afterparty later.

This is a fair bit of work to gain access to a feature, but that's because Audio sharing is still not publicly available yet.</p><p>All the steps in this section won't be required when Google officially rolls out Bluetooth LE and Auracast support via Audio sharing in a public release, but it's unclear when that will be. Since the feature isn't visible by default in the latest Android 16 Beta 4.1 release, it's not guaranteed that Audio sharing will be available on day one.</p><h2 id="how-to-start-audio-sharing-2">How to start Audio sharing</h2><p>Audio sharing requires supported earbuds or headphones, as you won't be able to start it on a Pixel phone without at least one pair connected. Your audio devices need to support Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) Audio to work with Audio sharing, and we have a rundown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">some supported earbuds and headphones here</a>. Not all of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best Android earbuds</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">headphones</a> support this feature, but many — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">3 Pro</a> — offer Bluetooth LE Audio.</p><p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em><em> If you don't immediately see your supported headphones or earbuds show up as Audio sharing compatible, completely forgetting the device and re-pairing should do the trick. Check if there's a toggle for </em><em><strong>LE Audio</strong></em><em> in the device settings page for each set of compatible earbuds, too.</em></p><p>With all that in mind, when you have Audio sharing visible on a Pixel phone and supported earbuds ready, you can start sharing by following these steps:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Connected devices page</strong>, then press <strong>Connection preferences</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>Audio sharing page</strong>, which is now visible.</p><p>4. Flip the toggle beside <strong>Audio sharing </strong>to start.</p><p>5. You'll now see a <strong>QR code</strong> appear for your broadcast alongside your device name and optional broadcast password — both of which are needed for others to connect to your broadcast.</p><p>6. Tap <strong>Pair new device</strong> to add earbuds or headphones or <strong>Close </strong>to finish.</p><p>7. You can also join an existing broadcast by tapping <strong>Find an audio stream</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY" name="Android-16-Share-Audio" alt="Starting an audio share on Android 16 with a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvovrzykWZkmhXQ2uCUCqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After that, you've created a broadcast and have the option to pair multiple LE Audio-compatible headsets to your Pixel phone.

The teased posters on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/2202387347">Weibo</a> also indicate that it is an advanced 3nm-based silicon (2nd gen), and leaked benchmarks indicate that it is likely a strong contender to Qualcomm’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> that powers most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phones</a> this year.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking) Xiaomi Xring O1 Geekbench pic.twitter.com/tXEQE65wXD<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1923978900004274653">May 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>According to tipster Jukanlosreve on X (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/xiaomis-in-house-xring-01-soc-leaked-melds-10-core-arm-cortex-cpu-plus-16-core-mali-g925-gpu">Tom’s Hardware</a>), the XRing 01 has been spotted on Geekbench tests, and the chipset scored a notable 2709 single-core score and 8125 multi-core score. On the other hand, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1924310555445416426/photo/1">tipster Ice Universe</a> has also shared another Geekbench test of the same chipset that revealed even better 3017 single-core and 9264 multi-core readings, which sounds promising for a new unreleased SoC.</p><p>The benchmark also implies that the XRing 01 is being run on an Android 15-based phone, likely the Xiaomi 15S Pro, which is also believed to be announced at the same event alongside the Xiaomi Pad 7 Ultra.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xiaomi XRing O1 pic.twitter.com/KUZ4zeJQaA<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1924244770563785102">May 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Interestingly, the Geekbench test also reveals the unique deca-core setup featuring two cores with 1.80GHz clock speeds, another two with 1.89GHz, four 3.40GHz speed cores, and two other cores with 3.90GHz.</p><p>The latter are expected to be the two Cortex-X925 cores, and the four are believed to be Cortex A725/X4 cores. The cores with 1.89GHz are likely the Cortex A720/A725 ones, and the first two are expected to be the Cortex A520 cores.</p><p>With the expected configuration and benchmark tests, the chipset alongside the Snapdragon 8 Elite is likely to take on Dimensity 9400 and Exynos 2400 SoCs as well. The chipset ahead of the release already sounds promising, which is understandable since the company has invested four years in research and development in making the SoC. It also makes Xiaomi join the list with its counterparts like Huawei, Apple, and Google, who all already develop their in-house chipsets for their flagships.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

While we recently got to see a slim phone from Samsung, OnePlus is set to debut its compact phone.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus 13s, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact handset</a> is making its way to the Indian market on June 5, and the teasers indicate that it is coming in at least three colors: black, pink, and a military green hue. The device also makes a notable departure from the conventional circular camera visor and instead opts for a squarish design that features two sensors.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new icon debuts.

Like the latter, the OnePlus 13s is also confirmed to have a 6.32-inch display and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/13s">OnePlus website listing</a>.</p><p>The other confirmed features of the OnePlus 13s include an all-new Plus Key, which replaces the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">famous Alert Slider</a>. While the slider offered minimal functionality, like changing the sound profiles, the Plus Key promises to offer several other functionalities, like setting it for sound profiles, enabling Do Not Disturb mode, invoking the camera, flashlight, to translate what’s on screen, and several others, which can also be AI-powered.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e" name="OnePlus-13s-teaser-image" alt="OnePlus 13s tease for India" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WsXqpghfmNZgJws7MdHM7e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 13s will also be 5.5G ready and also have an independent G1 Wi-Fi chipset and further promises to offer the best battery life on a compact phone. The OnePlus 13T in China notably featured a larger 6260mAh battery, a tad bit higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and 13R, which had 6000mAh batteries each. And, the latter two are significantly bigger in size than the OnePlus 13T’s compact offering. So, we expect a similar approach on the OnePlus 13s as well, including the incorporation of the company’s Glacier battery technology.</p><p>It is finally good to see the OnePlus 13s finally having a launch date after a host of teasers from the company that were shared on social media, and also on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/b?_encoding=UTF8&ie=UTF8&node=206845240031&store_ref=SB_A0221685GDPRJL3VQSBS-A06744412OMDOB09ESPP0&pd_rd_plhdr=t&aaxitk=ab41b09131f3ab6de73dfc7db206c1e3&hsa_cr_id=0&lp_query=oneplus+13s&lp_slot=auto-sparkle-hsa-tetris&pd_rd_w=ePE30&content-id=amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f:amzn1.sym.5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_p=5e94cbee-68a7-46b5-b2e9-bb5445edd00f&pf_rd_r=AM3FJ89TXFNSSS4PXNXB&pd_rd_wg=8SFde&pd_rd_r=be384195-b096-4101-b91e-706a6f498047&linkCode=sl2&tag=prsocial-21&linkId=fd1f401f3512d91f0cdec15cd78b3fca&language=en_IN&ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Amazon India listing</a>.

Everything you need to make it work, including a USB-C to USB-C cable and USB-A adapter, is included in the box.</p><p>The sound quality is exemplary, thanks in part to some proprietary parts made by Questyle, but there are some things you need to know as you consider the purchase, so let’s get into all of that!</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Categories</p></th><th  ><p>Questyle M18i</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Decoding</p></td><td  ><p><strong>PCM:</strong> 44.1kHz-384kHz (16/24/32bit)</p><p><strong>DSD:</strong> DSD64, DSD128, DSD256</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>16-core XMOS316 USB platform</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>DAC chipset</p></td><td  ><p>ESS Dual ES9219Q DACs</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Input</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, Apple MFi Certified</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Output(s)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5mm SE, 4.4mm Balanced </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth Codec Support</p></td><td  ><p>AAC, SBC, aptX, aptXHD, aptX adaptive, LDAC, LE Audio</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphone(s)</p></td><td  ><p>Infineon mic module (MEMs), Qualcomm cVc 8.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>500mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Supported OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android, iPadOS, iOS, HarmonyOS, Windows 10, Linux</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Power Output</p></td><td  ><p>28mW at 300 Ohms (4.4mm balanced output)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Frequency Response</p></td><td  ><p>0.1dB (20hz-20kHz), 2dB (20kHz-80kHz)THD: 0.0002%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="questyle-m18i-solid-sound-solid-build-2">Questyle M18i: Solid sound, solid build</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="p9MZk9zkxkPZdNaXbtcHr8" name="questyle-m18i-dac-branding.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i branding" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p9MZk9zkxkPZdNaXbtcHr8.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mRuudYTFcArTAawmfbe9V9" name="questyle-m18i-dac-unbox.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i unboxed contents" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mRuudYTFcArTAawmfbe9V9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>A lot is going on inside the M18i. Internally, the DAC uses dual ESS ES9219Q DACs and other hardware powered by a 16-core XMOS XU316 processor. You also get a Qualcomm chipset that includes its latest clear voice communications chipset and Infineon MEMS microphones. We’ll talk about those components more in a moment. There are a few other things inside the DAC, but I’ll go over those as I talk about audio quality. Check the spec table for other odds and technical ends you may be curious about.</p><p>The build quality is very reassuring. The unit is small, and all components are wrapped in a CNC anodized aluminum alloy. There’s a tempered glass screen on the front of the device with an OLED display. The information you’ll get from the top row of that screen is: volume, gain level (<strong>L</strong>ow or <strong>H</strong>igh), earbuds/headphone connected indicator, and battery charge indicator. Below that, you’ll see your sample rate in a larger font, and below that, the mode and decoding indicators.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="RD9hhSQEgXsPgjhovbcyCX" name="questyle-m18i-dac-buttons-panel.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i buttons panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RD9hhSQEgXsPgjhovbcyCX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Holding the device vertically with the screen facing you, the top is where you’ll find the 3.5mm (SE) and 4.4mm (Balanced) outputs. The right side is where you’ll find the delightfully clicky function buttons. You get a power button that will also dim the screen, separate volume up and down buttons, an MFB or multifunction button that controls gain and Bluetooth functions, and a mode sliding switch that is stiff and doesn’t feel like it will get loose anytime soon.</p><p>You’ll find one of two USB-C ports at the bottom of the unit. This one is primarily for data transfer, but in PC mode, the unit does charge from the source it’s connected to. The second USB-C port is on the left side and doesn’t support data.

Let’s talk about using it to drive the equally transparent, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-ie900-review" target="_blank">analytical Sennheiser IE900s</a>: This pairing is <em>not</em> for bass lovers, though tracks mastered with a heavy-handed low end sound superb with regard to their low-end nuance and resolve. Using the IE900s with the gain set to low and the 4.4mm Balanced connection, I could drive them beautifully with the volume only halfway up at 30 of 60 steps.</p><p>What is the “flavor profile” of this pairing? Very transparent. No color. An enjoyably large soundstage for IEMs, but the most compelling sonic feature is the nuance. Playing the DSF file of Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Starting Somethin’,” there are backing vocals mixed to almost a whisper, you can clearly discern during the song’s intro at 15 seconds in. A feature of that mix that gets lost in less transparent sound reproduction with more colored DACs and earbuds/headphones.</p><p>Regarding tracks mastered with bass emphasis, The Roots’ “Do You Want More??!!!?” sounds exactly like it should, with no coloring of the boom bap heavy bass. The bass is still quite satisfying with this pairing. A PCM file of Marvin Gaye’s “Trouble Man” exposes an awesome orchestral arrangement! All the nuance, layered electric and analog pianos, saxophones, and cymbals. It’s an engrossing sonic experience with the M18i. In terms of signal-to-noise, the M18i is very dark!</p><p>There is no audible noise during the quiet parts of the intro to Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.”</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk" name="questyle-m18i-dac-sample-rate.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing PCM file sample rate and Low gain in use" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KzRN8jwKpueHSZ9gkmB5kk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My sound test, pairing the M18i with Campfire Audio’s Mammoth IEMs via the 3.5mm connection, brought more weight and drama to the music with its more entertaining, punchier sound reproduction in the low end and sub-bass. There was some nuance lost in the low end with the IE900 that was realized with the Mammoth IEMs. This is the bass lovers' pairing.</p><p>Sennheiser HD660S2 was the first pairing that benefited from the high gain option, even with more juice flowing through the 4.4mm cables. I had to increase volume by nine steps, to 39. Over-ears allow the M18i to “stretch its legs” and expand that soundstage, giving it greater depth and layers as I listened to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST.</p><p>The detail in the attack and decay of the violins in Violin Duel was top tier! Next up, Ladysmith Black Mombazo’s ethereal a cappella on Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” was equally enjoyable, being so immersive thanks to the rich timbre and clarity provided in part by Questyle’s patented current-mode amplifier SiP technology found in all of their DACs.</p><p>In Bluetooth mode, the sound quality is still delightful. That said, there is a difference between the wired and Bluetooth 5.4 presentations. Still, thanks to the broad support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">Qualcomm aptX and LDAC HiRes Wireless Audio codecs</a>, that difference is minimal and likely indistinguishable to those new to active listening.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Q6NcKS7gUMsr2aGiLC9dfj" name="questyle-m18i-dac-microphone.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing power and volume buttons, along with the microphone port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q6NcKS7gUMsr2aGiLC9dfj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Continuing with the Bluetooth implementation, the Qualcomm chipset gave me better mic audio than expected. Frankly, this Infineon MEMS mic setup in the M18i sounds better than many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> I've reviewed, up there with Jabra, Beats, and AirPods Pro. It doesn't 100% eliminate background noise, but it gives you a healthy balance of background noise dampening with crystal clear voice pickup, so you don't sound like you're in a closet, as some TWS earbuds do.</p><p>Overall, from mobile to PC, the M18i presents an impressive sonic image. It’s balanced and transparent, with beautifully layered instrumentation separation. It also has the versatility to go anywhere and connect to almost anything, including Linux and HarmonyOS.</p><h2 id="the-m18i-is-almost-perfect-except-for-2">The M18i is almost perfect, except for….</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj" name="questyle-m18i-dac-charging-port.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing the dedicated USB-C port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pn4jkfVxLpcnTohUA8jVEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life will be a pain point. One hour of wired hi-res file playback drained the battery from 97% to 41%. My results in battery testing were pretty consistent across modes, except for PC mode. That means the max you can expect out of the M18i is roughly two hours of playback.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a feature that mitigates the disappointing battery life of the internal 500mAh cell. Switching to PC mode will power the DAC from whatever device it’s plugged into. I tested that with my Google Pixel 9, and the phone’s battery drained at a rate of approximately 10% per hour. I tested with the phone in airplane mode because I wanted to see what the pull looked like without additional factors draining the battery, like weak cellular signal strength.</p><p>The side USB-C port also helps mitigate the short battery life. It supports charging <em>during</em> playback, so you can have a battery bank with you on that long-haul airplane ride to keep the tunes going as you cross the Atlantic or Pacific.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-it-2">Should you buy it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="CnNADryE9xnAprCUiNgHZk" name="questyle-m18i-dac-buttons-panel2.JPG" alt="Questyle M18i showing buttons panel, USB-C cable, and Campfire Audio IEMs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CnNADryE9xnAprCUiNgHZk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ve had the pleasure of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android" target="_blank">testing some wonderfully entertaining audiophile-grade mobile DACs</a> from iFi, Quedelix, and Fiio, and this is now one of my favorites.
