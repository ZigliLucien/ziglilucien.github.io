                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Regardless of whether you think the Razr Ultra 2025 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is the best clamshell foldable, Motorola had a heavy hand in making both devices great. It's easy to forget that Motorola, not Samsung, pushed the boundaries of flip-style foldables by introducing larger cover screens and more flexible software.</p><p>And yet, Samsung clearly got the details right, leveraging its years of experience developing foldables to create Galaxy Z Flip products with superior build quality compared to Motorola Razr phones. That's part of the reason my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> — a phone I purchased with my own money — didn't stick. With a fragile hinge and tons of wobble, the Razr Plus 2023 ended up feeling more like a kid's toy than a Samsung competitor.</p><p>Fast-forward two years, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">Razr Plus 2025</a> unsurprisingly trounce my old Razr Plus 2023. However, after a closer look, I was shocked to discover that even the base-model Razr 2025 will beat my Razr Plus 2023. If that isn't a clear indication of Motorola's progress with foldables, I don't know what is.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-1" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Motorola first released a base-model Razr, it was a pared-down version of the Plus model with a cover screen that wasn't very useful and limited functionality overall. Over the past few years, the company has been steadily bringing "Plus" features to the standard Razr, and it's paying off. The Razr 2025, which costs $699, will handily outperform a Razr Plus 2023 that cost $1,000 just a few years ago.</p><p>For me, it starts with what most people would describe as the intangibles. These aren't things like processor speed, camera quality, or display technology. Instead, they're build quality, durability, and overall feel — areas that the Razr Plus 2023 struggled so deeply at that it became unusable as a daily driver for me. These are precisely the aspects of the Razr 2025 that are significantly improved.</p><p>For starters, Motorola's hinge quality has come a long way, and this year's units are now reinforced with titanium as opposed to stainless steel in older units. I've yet to try the Razr 2025, but my colleagues tell me that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024" target="_blank">Motorola's hinge on the 2024 and especially the 2025 models</a> is sturdier and more satisfying, even if not quite on Samsung's level. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof" target="_blank">the Razr 2025 features an IP48 certification</a>, which adds dust resistance — a feature sorely missing in earlier iterations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-3" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As an early adopter who had been burned by subpar build quality on the Motorola Plus 2023, those Razr 2025 improvements are enough to make me consider an upgrade. The thing is, there are plenty more enhancements worth noting. The new 4,500mAh capacity has to be near the top of the list. It's significantly more than the 3,800mAh inside my Razr Plus 2023, and it's even more than the Razr Plus 2024 <em>and</em> 2025 offer.</p><p>In practice, this should help the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> last all day, and the 15W wireless charging speeds will help you power up quickly. That's up from the 5W available on the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, we can't forget that the primary camera on the Razr 2025 is a 50MP, f/1.7 lens that will vastly outperform the 12MP primary sensor on the Razr Plus 2023.</p>
<h2 id="should-we-be-surprised-the-new-razr-beats-a-two-year-old-phone-2">Should we be surprised the new Razr beats a two-year-old phone?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Three Razr 2025 phones stacked on top of each other" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Denu4EfRCdzoo6borEdDZQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By this point, you might be wondering whether it's really a shock that the Razr 2025 will crush the Razr Plus 2023 in terms of features and value. After all, the latter is now almost two years old. Believe it or not, the answer is yes, it's absolutely surprising.</p><p>All it takes to prove that is a look at what Apple and Samsung are doing with their budget phones. The iPhone SE is a laughingstock, lacking even MagSafe compatibility, and the Galaxy A56 might be worse — our Android Central editor Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">called it "the worst midrange phone" he used this year</a>.</p><p>Put simply, companies rarely rush to improve their mid-range and base-model phones. It takes a hungry brand, like Motorola, that's desperately fighting for market share to do that. It's remarkable that a $699 foldable released in 2025 can outperform a flagship foldable that's barely two years old.</p><p>As someone who loves the <em>idea</em> of the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 but not the execution, I feel compelled to upgrade to a Razr 2025 series phone. Although it's easy to want the best, my gut is telling me to pick the Razr 2025 over the Plus and Ultra variants. The base model is a massive upgrade over the Razr I have now, so why wouldn't I?</p>

<ul><li>A month after it's initial announcement, the AYANEO Pocket ACE is officially available for pre-order.</li><li>Powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, this is arguably the most powerful 4.5-inch gaming handheld we've seen.</li><li>You can pre-order the Pocket ACE via the Indiegogo campaign with prices starting at ~$343 for the base 8GB/128GB model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Now might not be the best time to release a new gaming handheld, but all of the tariff nonsense isn't stopping AYANEO. The company unwrapped any remaining details regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Pocket ACE</a>, including configurations and pricing.</p><p>We already knew that AYANEO's latest handheld would be on the smaller side, thanks to its 4.5-inch IPS display, which features a resolution of 1620 x 1080. The borderless design should help make the screen feel bigger than it is, as we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Pocket EVO</a>.</p>

<p>For retro gamers, this might just be the ultimate gaming handheld thanks to its compact form factor paired with the 3:2 "Golden Ratio" display. This is considered by many to be perfect for retro games, as it strikes the right balance between the 4:3 aspect ratio of original consoles and the 16:9 aspect ratio that is utilized today. As a result, the 3:2 screen of the Pocket ACE results in games filling more of the display, relying less on black bars or having stretched content.</p><p>Additionally, the Pocket ACE is easily the most compact "flagship" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles" target="_blank">gaming handheld</a> to be released. While it misses out on the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, which will debut later this year in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneos-next-flagship-gaming-handheld-is-coming-soon">Pocket S2</a>, the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 is no slouch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-3" alt="All three AYANEO Pocket ACE Colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6820" height="3836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the same chip found in the AYANEO Pocket S, and it is essentially an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. This is important as it is largely considered the "standard" for Android gaming due to the community support in custom drivers paired with the current crop of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a>.</p><p>With that, the Pocket ACE is available in four different configurations, starting with an 8GB/128GB combination. It maxes out with the Pocket ACE Retro Power Edition, equipped with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of expandable storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F3BLFrpwCyqE5wTdFukBuY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-11" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE two player gameplay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3BLFrpwCyqE5wTdFukBuY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a good chance that this handheld will be a beast when it comes to battery life. AYANEO managed to fit a 6,000mAh battery, along with active cooling and 40W PD charging, into the Pocket ACE. While AYANEO didn't specify how long it's estimated to last, we suspect that you'll be able to use it for a couple of days before needing to charge it back up.</p><p>Now for arguably the most important piece of the puzzle: the price. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>, the base model is priced at $339, rising to $459 upon campaign conclusion. Here's how pricing shakes out for all four configurations:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-5" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE Retro Power hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4999" height="2812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Based on the table above, it appears that the 12GB/256GB version offers the best value. This is the steepest discount of the four, offering a $120 savings if you pre-order during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>. Considering that the device features a built-in microSD card slot, you won't have to worry about storage limitations.</p><p>When will the Pocket ACE actually make its way into our hands? According to the IGG Campaign, it's estimated to begin shipping sometime next month. Now, we just have to hope that the ongoing political climate doesn't get in the way of us being able to enjoy the latest AYANEO offering.</p>

The brand is looking to build on that with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which delivers decent upgrades in most areas. The most notable addition is a 50MP tele lens at the back as well as an 8MP wide-angle module that joins the main 50MP camera, and it gives the CMF Phone 2 Pro versatility like no other budget phone today. <br><br>You also get an AMOLED panel with ultra-thin bezels — similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">3a Pro</a> — a decent-sized battery, IP54 ingress protection, and the best software of any budget phone available today. The best part is that Nothing is continuing its value-focused push, and the Phone 2 Pro costs just a smidgen more than its predecessor. <br><br>Is this the budget phone of 2025, then? Without a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="eyZaLpkDeXQAEkeGpy3ZGW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyZaLpkDeXQAEkeGpy3ZGW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing unveiled the CMF Phone 2 Pro at a global launch event in India on April 28, and the phone is slated to go on sale in the country starting May 5. The good news is that it costs just ₹18,999 ($223) for the variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and that's just ₹1,000 ($12) more than what the Phone 1 debuted at last year. Nothing is also selling the device in an 8GB/256GB configuration at ₹20,999 ($246), and both models retain the MicroSD card slot — a great move in 2025. <br><br>Annoyingly, the device isn't launching in the U.S., with Nothing making the 8GB/256GB variant available as part of the beta initiative for $279. Thankfully, the device will be on sale in the U.K. and other markets in the region, debuting at £219 ($293) for the 8GB/128GB edition and £249 ($333) for the 8GB/256GB model. In Germany, it's launching at €249 ($283) for the 8GB/128GB variant, and €279 ($317) for 8GB/256GB.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XDvTUZxDVpeJUZWDwmWvJW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5154" height="2903" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing's mainline phones stand out for their designs, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro is no different. While it doesn't feature a similar design language, the bold colors and vibrant accents give the phone a good presence, and the design belies the price tag. I haven't used an entry-level phone that looks this good, and if you want a device that turns heads, you'll need to get the orange model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="uk8ozwxA4tsSCCfKjBho8W" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uk8ozwxA4tsSCCfKjBho8W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the green version of the CMF Phone 2 Pro, and it has a back that mimics a frosted-glass finish. The black version uses the same texture, with the white model delivering a sandstone-like matte texture instead. The orange color, meanwhile, has a metallic sheen, and looks very distinctive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WFuk3r5jtjRVxhLxSnDH7W" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFuk3r5jtjRVxhLxSnDH7W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another distinction is the dimensions; coming in at 7.8mm, the Phone 2 Pro is the thinnest Nothing phone yet, and at 185g, it is 12g lighter than the CMF Phone 1 — there's a noticeable difference between the two when it comes to in-hand feel. The back has smooth curves where it meets the mid-frame, and it has good weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MpYyaaABZD2njPMWq5z6yV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpYyaaABZD2njPMWq5z6yV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Nothing added the Essential Key to the Phone 2 Pro as well; the dedicated button debuted on the Phone 3a Pro this year, and it allows you to launch Essential Space, a dashboard that lets you save notes, images, and just about anything else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.49%;"><img id="LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2884" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rear camera design is accentuated by bright rings around each module, and it gives additional flair to the design — not that it needed it. A key difference this year is that the back is fully sealed; this allowed the brand to achieve an IP54 ingress protection. Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis revealed during a briefing that the device is water-resistant, but that it didn't go through the requisite IP testing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the back cover is no longer detachable, the CMF Phone 2 Pro doesn't quite have the same level of modularity as its predecessor. That said, Nothing is debuting a universal case that attaches to the back, and it enables the use of several accessories. This time around, the accessories include a kickstand that connects magnetically to the universal case, a macro lens, fisheye lens, and a lanyard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6ig9gUuynzxyATLTJncgW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6ig9gUuynzxyATLTJncgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Attaching the accessories is about as easy as it gets once you affix the universal case to the back of the Phone 2 Pro. While I generally liked using the universal case, it doesn't confirm to the curves at the back, and it has a distinct plastic feel to it. It's a good way to enable the use of custom accessories, and for what it's worth, the Phone 2 Pro as a whole has a design that looks much more polished.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro-display"><span>Nothing CMF Phone 2 Pro: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="M776xpmAyaeUrktbydfWbW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M776xpmAyaeUrktbydfWbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing is using a similar-sized 6.77-inch FHD+ AMOLED panel as last year, but it went with a flexible AMOLED on the Phone 2 Pro, resulting in thinner and even bezels on all sides. Evangelidis noted that the switch to a flexible AMOLED added to the device's manufacturing costs, but as the brand wanted to retain parity with its mainline phones, it used the costlier panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also greater flexibility with panel refresh, with the Phone 2 Pro able to switch between 30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz. The device even gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming, and the panel itself is the best of any budget phone around. I didn't run into any issues during regular use or while gaming, and Nothing did all the right things in this area.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick Sutrich tested the device's PWM dimming, and noted that it was more than double that of the CMF Phone 1 at low brightness, which is great. When you boost the brightness to over 50%, you get DC dimming as standard.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="YfK395UTkLuxtd34mmRGKW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfK395UTkLuxtd34mmRGKW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5119" height="2883" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing is once again using MediaTek's Dimensity 7300 Pro this generation, and the platform is clearly showing its age; I haven't used a phone with the older Cortex A78 and A55 cluster in a while. That said, Nothing did a decent job optimizing the platform, and there isn't any noticeable lag in regular use.</p>

<p>The phone is passable at gaming too, and while you don't get smooth framerates, there isn't too much jitter, and it is usable if you turn down the settings. That said, I'd strongly recommend picking up the Phone 3a Pro if you're looking at a budget-focused gaming device — it does a much better job in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="h8Hu7HLuyA3SjPd7nXLGgW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8Hu7HLuyA3SjPd7nXLGgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, the notable inclusion is a MicroSD slot; the base variant's 128GB storage is decent enough, and while 8GB of memory is usable, Nothing should have rolled out a 12GB/256GB variant at least. You don't get AptX codecs, but there's the standard Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. <br><br>Nothing didn't change anything on the battery side of things, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro retains a 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging. Interestingly, the Indian model now includes a charger in the box — Nothing says its userbase in the country was vocal about its inclusion — but other regions miss out on the same. You can use any USB PD charger with the device, and in general, I got a day's worth of use comfortably.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SkoWKwnu7Z9SbnTJjbhYuV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkoWKwnu7Z9SbnTJjbhYuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro gets a trio of cameras at the back, including a 50MP main lens, 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP wide-angle lens. That's a big deal in itself considering most phones in this category have just a single usable camera, and it's good to see the brand providing decent versatility.<br><br>The camera interface is pretty basic, but you get access to all the shooting modes and toggles. It takes 4K30 video, and while the video quality isn't particularly great, it is usable. There's a decent number of shooting modes, and the phone does a passable job with portraits.</p>

<p>Daylight shots have good detail and color vibrancy, and I didn't see any issues in this area. What I like the most is how well the CMF Phone 2 Pro handles low-light imagery; even in challenging conditions, it delivered photos with good colors and little to no visible noise. The wide-angle and 2x tele lenses are good in their own right, and if you need a little extra, Nothing has macro and fisheye lens attachments. <br><br>The fisheye lens is fun to use, but I didn't see much utility out of the macro module. Overall, the camera on the CMF Phone 2 Pro is the best you'll find on a sub-$300 phone, and Nothing deserves credit for bundling a strong package.</p>

<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro runs Nothing OS 3.2 based on Android 15 out of the box, and the brand continues to do a stellar job with its UI. You get a clean interface with a distinct visual styling, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable. Nothing's exclusive widgets are a big part of why I like using its phones, and the design combined with usability makes the OS as a whole stand out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a good amount of customizability as well, and the interface is fluid — I didn't have issues in daily use. You get the usual AI-enabled utilities with on-device transcribing, and Nothing uses ChatGPT for any cloud-facing requests. On that note, a new addition is Essential Space, which basically makes it easy to organize information, including creating notes, taking memos, and saving things like billers.</p>

<p>The utility does a great job, and it's another way that Nothing differentiates its devices. Switching over to updates, the CMF Phone 2 Pro will get three Android OS updates and six years of security updates, and that's among the best of any budget phone today.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro-the-alternatives"><span>Nothing CMF Phone 2 Pro: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dTFgzp9iUDD3sYwQFGgNEW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTFgzp9iUDD3sYwQFGgNEW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO's X7 continues to be a good choice if you need a reliable budget phone. It has the same MediaTek Dimensity 7300 platform, a bigger 5500mAh battery with 45W charging, and IP68 ingress protection. The software isn't as good as the CMF phone 2 Pro, and it won't get as many updates, but if battery life is a priority, the X7 is a good option. <br><br>Last year's CMF Phone 1 is still quite decent, and a viable alternative if you can get a good deal on the device. Obviously, you miss out on the upgrades that the CMF Phone 2 Pro offers, but the Phone 1 is a great device in its own right.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing CMF Phone 2 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone that looks great</li><li>You want good cameras</li><li>You need clean software on a budget device</li><li>You want timely software updates</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a gaming phone</li></ul>
<p>Nothing is making a habit of showing up other budget phones, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro is my go-to recommendation if you need a new sub-$300 phone in 2025. There's a lot to like with the design, and the unique accessories give the device an edge. The AMOLED panel has good colors, and the thin bezels make the device feel premium. <br><br>You get a good set of cameras at the back, great battery life, and the software is easily the best you'll find on any budget phone. The only limitation is around gaming; you'll want to get the Phone 3a Pro if you need a bit of added power, but other than that, the CMF Phone 2 Pro is a fantastic all-rounder.</p>

<p>After debuting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">Palma 2 and Note Air4 C</a> last year, Boox is back with a new set of portable readers — the new Go 7 series.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/go7">ereaders were launched</a> late last week and include the Go 7 and Go Color 7 (Gen II). These new Android-based eReaders come with writing capabilities for immersive reading. They also claim to be ideal sidekicks for commuters and for those who prefer to read in outdoor environments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="46LGrkJKLt64UKWSyRu5Pk" name="Boox-Go-7" alt="Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46LGrkJKLt64UKWSyRu5Pk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both eReaders carry the same screen sizes, which are 7 inches; however, the Go Color 7 equips a Kaleido 3 display — the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Colour</a> — promising a true-to-life color panel. It also promises to offer visually rich content. On the other hand, the regular Go 7 comes with a Carta 1300 monochrome display and has a resolution of 300ppi, with a sharp text clarity that is believed to mimic traditional paper. Additionally, both also feature adjustable front lights for comfortable reading in all lighting conditions.</p><p>Further, both models support handwriting capabilities with the help of Boox’s InkSense stylus — to quickly jot down thoughts, highlight text, and mark up in the books users read. They are also provided with a dedicated Notes app to write things when required.</p>

<p>Underneath, the latest Boox ereaders run Android 13 and have access to the Google Play Store to install your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">favorite Android apps</a>. Both models are equipped with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of inbuilt storage, which can further be expanded with the help of a microSD card.</p><p>Lastly, these ereaders weigh around 195 grams each and offer a compact and lightweight form factor that further helps in easy one-handed use, which is essential for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">any e-ink device</a>. In addition, they have wide bezels to hold on to, an ergonomic page turn button, and a textured back for additional grip. And for protection against spills and light rain, they feature a water-repellent design.</p><p>The Boox Go 7 and Go Color 7 both come in two color options — black and white — with the latter getting a navy blue finish.

<ul><li>Samsung's next rugged Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 could debut along with its foldable lineup, according to a new leak.</li><li>A Greek news website claims that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 will launch in July, along with the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2.</li><li>The rumor states that the watch will see no design or price change as well.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A new leak has surfaced, claiming that Samsung's second iteration of its rugged smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, is set to launch this summer. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/galaxy-watch-ultra-2-could-debut-at-galaxy-z-fold-7-event-and-with-no-price-increase">Tech Radar</a>, this new leak originates from a Greek news website, which states that the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 will launch alongside Samsung's foldable lineup — the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Z Fold 7.</p><p>If this rumor is accurate, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 could potentially be unveiled in July. Earlier speculation suggests that the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is scheduled for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">early July in New York.</a></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techmaniacs.gr/apokleistiko-ayta-einai-ta-galaxy-z-fold-7-kai-z-flip-7-epiteloys-pragmatika-lepta/" target="_blank">Techmaniacs</a>, the above-mentioned website stated that "We just learned that, along with the phones, a new Galaxy Watch Ultra will also be coming."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-display.jpeg" alt="A close-up view of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and its default watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j3sbcMwSzXdxXWBGby3EjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The lack of leaks about the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 leaves us with little to no information about the specs or the design. However, the publication added that the wearable "will feature a similar design to the current watch, but with more storage space, and a new user interface more reminiscent of One UI 7."</p><p>This could mean that the smartwatch could have the same squircle design as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but with enhanced storage and possibly a more intuitive interface. We're hoping that the new Watch Ultra will feature a renewed design, possibly with a physical bezel, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Watch 6 Classic, </a>or<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank"> </a>a rotating crown, like many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">Android watches</a> on the market.</p><p>As for the cost of this high-end rugged watch, Techmaniacs claims the price will remain the same as its predecessor, which is approximately $649.99. Although this is still a leak, it remains uncertain whether the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 will be released in July with the aforementioned specs.  That said, here's Android Central's comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2" target="_blank">wishlist</a> of everything we expect to see in a future Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 model.</p>

<p>In other news, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic,</a> which is also rumored to launch this summer, alongside the standard<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> Galaxy Watch 8 </a>and their foldable devices, was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-classic-bluetooth-cert-spotted">spotted</a> in the Bluetooth SIG database for certification. We're hoping to see more leaks drop closer to July.

<ul><li>Google One device backups currently include text message data, but not SIM information.</li><li>In a future update, Google could add the ability to save SIM data, likely for eSIMs.</li><li>This addition could simplify the process of backing up and restoring Android phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google could be developing a way to include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/esim-simplified-my-life-but-not-in-the-way-i-expected">eSIM data</a> as part of the device backup process for Android phones, according to code strings found by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-sim-backup-apk-teardown-3548643/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The code, discovered in an APK teardown of the Google Play Services app beta version 25.16.33, lists "SIMs" as a backup data type for the first time. However, it is not functional and isn't guaranteed to arrive in a future update.</p><p>The code strings in the Google Play Services app beta aren't the only things indicating Google is working on eSIM backups. In a refreshed version of Android's device backup settings page, a description of "other device data" now includes "contacts, call history, device settings, apps and app data, SMS and MMS messages, and SIMs to your Google Account."</p><p>While not explicitly stated, it can be assumed that this feature would handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIMs</a>, as physical SIM cards can be easily transferred between devices. However, both Apple and Samsung offer software tools that can convert a physical SIM to an on-device eSIM, so it's possible Google's work-in-progress feature handles physical SIM cards as well.</p><p>Here's the exact code string that points to future SIM backups:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><code>&lt;string name="backup_settings_devicedata_data_type_sims"&gt;SIMs&lt;/string&gt;</code></code></pre>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that SIMs can't be backed up at the moment. If this functionality was added in a future update, it would make the process of restoring backups on Android easier than on iPhone.</p>

<p>The feature would be added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-back-your-android-phone-and-data-google-one">Google One device backup</a>, and would require a paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription plan</a> for use.

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a more convenient (and quicker) method for users looking to add digital cards to their phones.</p><p>After tearing through a recent Play Services beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-add-cards-nfc-apk-teardown-3548577/">Android Authority</a> discovered what looks to be a "tap-to-add" feature for Google Wallet. Evidence in the code was light; however, Google's additions mention the feature by name, as well as stating, "Hold your card to the back of your device until it vibrates."</p><p>Another string states users would need to "tap card to phone" to progress with the supposed card-adding method.</p><p>At the core of this feature is what your phone would leverage, which, in this case, is NFC. The early code lacks more robust bits of information, but the publication has speculated what the meat of the feature could look like. It suggests the NFC scanning could leverage your card's number and expiration date, leaving the (arguably) most crucial aspect to you: its CVV.</p><p>Moreover, there are assumptions that Google Wallet's feature could feature a few limitations, like only accepting cards that are "EMV-compliant." The post states this involves card companies like Visa and Mastercard. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-tap-to-add-card/">Android Police</a> presumes this feature (if it rolls out) could see limited availability like Apple's version via Apple Wallet.</p>

<p>As Google seemingly works to build upon NFC on Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-next-evolution-of-nfc-will-let-you-do-more-with-a-single-tap">the NFC Forum discussed ways</a> it wants to further enhance the feature for all consumers. According to the Forum, there are plans to introduce "Multi-Purpose Tap." This would enable the possibility of multiple transactions "to be seamlessly conducted over the course of one single tap," per the executive director of the NFC Forum, Mike McCamon.</p><p>A likely scenario is Multi-Purpose Tap could let users verify their age via their digital ID, pay with their preferred card, and receive a digital receipt all in one go.</p><p>In recent history, Google's been busy upgrading the range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">supported digital IDs</a> in the U.S. There's been some resistance in bringing this functionality to all states, considering every place has its own rules and regulations regarding digital IDs. However, Google's worked to add Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland. California already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-preapres-google-wallet-id-support">started down its path</a> to incorporate digital IDs last August.</p><p>Google Wallet's latest update brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-train-status-alerts-update-io-teaser">real-time train status updates</a> to users. After adding a train ticket, Wallet will deliver "On Time," "Delayed," and other status updates about your ride. The feature is limited to two regions at the moment, so the bulk of us will have to wait.</p>

<p>Looks like something exciting is brewing at Google. The company just dropped a teaser for a new episode of The Android Show.</p><p>For the first time, the show will feature an exclusive I/O edition, which is said to provide Android enthusiasts around the globe with a "lowdown on the latest Android innovations and experiences in the run up to Google I/O," the show announced, teasing this episode on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/new-features-on-android/io-2025/">official website</a>.</p><p>The episode will air on May 13 at 1 p.m. and will be hosted by Sameer Samat, president of the Android Ecosystem, as well as other Android team members who will discuss new features set to debut with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and other Android-related developments in the works.</p><p>“What's new with Android has always been a huge part of Google I/O, and we know people are excited! That's why we're kicking off this year's I/O season with a special deep dive," Samat added.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/events/show">The Android Show</a> is a video series produced by the Android Developers team at Google. The show typically launches a new episode every quarter that discusses all things Android, including news, features, and updates.</p><p>This I/O episode is unique since Google usually keeps all the new Android developments under wraps until it announces everything at I/O. For it to announce innovations ahead of the main event, it could only mean that they have a lot to discuss on the Android front and are splitting it into two parts, or that I/O will be heavily focused on AI.</p><p>Further explaining what folks could expect from this episode, Samat said, "We'll be sharing news now to get you ready for I/O, where we'll have even more special announcements and surprises in store.”</p><p>During the MWC this year, Samat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">hinted</a> at showing off some of Android 16's new features ahead of launch, which we thought would happen at this year's I/O. However, a glimpse at the new OS seems to be coming a week early, and we're not complaining.</p><p>Google added that this show will be pre-recorded and streamed on YouTube Live at the above-mentioned time. Those interested can hit the "notify me" button within the teaser (below), so that they don't miss out on the fun.</p>

<p>That said, last week, Google put out a comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">lineup</a> of scheduled events and workshops set to take place at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O</a> this year.

If one is not detected at any time while you’re wearing the watch, it will automatically begin a process towards contacting emergency services for you.</p><p>This is a potentially life-saving feature for someone who might have suffered a heart attack or other potentially fatal incident, ensuring help will be on the way even if you’re unconscious. While the hope is that you’ll never have to use it, you’ll want to turn the feature on so it’s ready to go should an incident arise.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZzLFs2pE7rcQ8wS9GA9FDh" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-heart-rate" alt="The heart rate tile on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzLFs2pE7rcQ8wS9GA9FDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once the feature is enabled, the watch’s optical heart rate sensors continue to monitor your heart rate signal as they usually would, delivering real-time heart rate data. If the watch fails to detect a pulse at any time while you’re wearing it, it will first vibrate, looking for a response. If there is none, it will then play a loud sound and begin a countdown. If movement or a pulse is detected again at any point, or you tap the “X” to dismiss the countdown, the emergency notification will end.</p><p>However, if there is no response, the watch will take measures to ensure that emergency services can assist. Once contacted, emergency services will receive an automated message indicating your location and advising that a pulse was not detected and you have not responded.</p><p>The watch must be within range of and connected to your phone for this feature to work, and you cannot be on an active call. If you have the LTE version of the watch, the service needs to be active.</p><p>What can cause a loss of pulse? This can occur following things like cardiac arrest, respiratory or circulatory failure, overdose, or poisoning. It is possible for the feature to yield a poor pulse reading even when there is no issue. If this happens at any time, you can easily dismiss the notification before the watch proceeds to the next steps.</p>

<p>Loss of Pulse Detection is only available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> and is intended for those 22 years of age and older. It currently works in the U.S., U.K., Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p><p>Google is working to obtain regulatory clearance in other countries. For now, if you travel to a country or region where the feature isn’t supported, note that the feature will be temporarily suspended until you arrive back home or in a region where it works.</p><p>Note that, as mentioned, you must be signed in to Personal Safety with your Google Account to enable this feature.

<ul><li>Rumors suggest Qualcomm is working on a "Snapdragon 8 Elite 2" and its reveal could occur earlier toward the end of September.</li><li>Companies could also look to launch smartphones with the chip in October, potentially early in the month.</li><li>The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 is rumored to rock heavy-hitting "enhanced Pegasus cores" with 5GHz clock speeds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The next generation of phones is always a hot topic, and new rumors claim those devices could pop up sooner than before.</p><p>There's speculation that Qualcomm could reveal its next flagship SoC even sooner in 2025, which would mean an earlier Summit. These rumors stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5159630734623675">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) on Weibo (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26s-next-snapdragon-chipset-may-see-early-reveal-in-september/">SamMobile</a>). According to the tipster, Qualcomm is supposedly preparing to debut a "Snapdragon 8 Elite 2" at the end of September.</p><p>The post adds that the company's "internal schedule" has remained "the same."</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims smartphone OEMs will "basically release" the first batch of phones with the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 "in October." While the Weibo post didn't offer any insight into potential specs, SamMobile chimed in with some rumors. The Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 could achieve 5GHz speeds for its main core.</p><p>The publication states this is tipped to come off the back of Qualcomm's "enhanced Pegasus cores." The chip may come paired with the Adreno 840 GPU for a strong gaming experience, as well as LPDDR6 RAM support.</p>

<p>The alleged timeline change might only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">bump things up by a few weeks</a>. Qualcomm held its Summit in Hawaii last year from October 21 to October 23. With the current rumors, perhaps we're looking at a potential Summit date during the week of September 22. That might also (if we consider the rumors) push smartphone makers to deploy their newest Snapdragon 8 Elite 2-ready devices in the first couple of weeks of October.</p><p>We can use Xiaomi's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-snapdragon-8-elite-keynote-announcement">2024 Summit announcement</a> as an example. The Chinese OEM stated its devices would "be the first" to use the original Elite globally. A week later, the phones launched in China; however, their global debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-preps-global-debut-8-elite-fcc-listing">wouldn't happen for a while</a>. The main takeaway is that Xiaomi's launch occurred one week <em>after </em>Qualcomm's Summit.</p><p>There's a chance history could repeat itself, but just a little faster this time.</p><p>It's also worth remembering that the Snapdragon 8 Elite launched with two prime cores, clocking out at 4.32GHz. This pair was complemented by six 3.53GHz performance cores. Rumors currently claim Qualcomm could increase its heavy-hitters by ~0.7GHz for even stronger performance. It remains to be seen if price hike worries come around again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">like they did with the first</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>T asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Every year I get a new phone for work and the IT department says they "securely wipe" the data from my old one before they turn it over to the purchasing department. Are they serious? If you can do that, can you tell me how?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hey T, cool question!</p><p>Whenever there's a clear answer, I like to give it right up front because I know a lot of people don't want to read the whole article, so yes. You can do that a few different ways, though some of them are going to destroy the phone. I'm going to assume they are doing it without trashing everything since they are turning it over when they are done.</p><p>Another thing to think about is why anyone would need to do this, and that's where we will start.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-secure-wipe-and-why-would-you-need-to-do-it-2">What is a "secure wipe" and why would you need to do it?</h2>
<p>You're probably under the impression that once you delete something from any sort of electronic storage, it's gone forever. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datarecovery/" target="_blank">It's not</a>.</p><p>For regular folks like us, yeah. Once you delete it and empty any sort of trash bin folder that catches everything, you can say goodbye to it. But for people with the right hardware, the right software, and the know-how to use it all, a lot of stuff can be retrieved.</p><p>That's because when you delete something, you usually don't delete it. You just delete the bits that tell the system it's there and where it was. For example, if I take a picture of my dog, and delete it after it was saved, the information that makes the picture stays. Only the information that said what it was is removed, and the system thinks the space is now free.</p><p>Eventually, the data to create my dog picture will be overwritten by new data, and then it's gone forever. Until then, sometimes you can get it back — if you have the means.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="d8DPzZdowNaYgxkUQeV5nV" name="ben-puppy.jpg" alt="Ben Dog" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d8DPzZdowNaYgxkUQeV5nV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>This is pretty universal, regardless of whether you're talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">a phone</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">computer</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">tablet</a>, or even one of those digital picture frames. Encryption makes it really hard to get any useful data, and your phone is encrypted unless you monkey with it, so it's really not worth worrying about unless you're keeping super-secret important stuff on it.</p><p>For people who feel they need to worry about it, they should perform a secure wipe of all the data.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-securely-wipe-a-phone-2">How to securely wipe a phone</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to do it, but in this case, they're almost certainly doing it without destroying the storage media. That means they hook it up to something that will completely fill the storage with new, but completely nonsensical data; really just a bunch of 1s and 0s in a random pattern. This will make sure all of the storage is overwritten, and anything old will be truly destroyed.</p><p>Though it's a long process, you can do this to your phone yourself. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">Factory reset</a> the phone, go through the setup <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-can-you-use-an-android-phone-without-google"><strong>without</strong> entering any accounts</a>, attach it to a computer, and start copying tons of small text files that are just a single page of "11111111111111111" over and over. This won't clear the system storage, but nothing should ever be written to it, so it's plenty of overkill if you think you need the overkill. Once the phone's storage is full, factory reset it again.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fPBoNi4kCeqjaFjAZrYM4R" name="raspberry-pi-4-board-up-close.jpg" alt="Raspberry Pi 4 board up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPBoNi4kCeqjaFjAZrYM4R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The easy way is with a hammer or a couple of pairs of pliers. Breaking it into tiny bits will ensure you can never get the data from the device. It's also kind of fun. Just make sure you bust up all the small silicon rectangles to make sure you get the storage media.</p><p>This is how some government agencies "delete" data from old computer hard drives, and there is a person who gets paid to smash the hell out of them. Once done, just toss everything in a baggie to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-recycle-your-old-android-phone">drop in an e-waste bin</a>, and you're good to go.</p>
<p>While some people really do need to live with this level of paranoia, you don't, I don't, and 99.9% of the people reading this don't. Getting old deleted data from an encrypted device that was wiped is nearly impossible, so the data has to be worth the effort.</p><p>If you want something to worry about, look at what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/companies-are-still-selling-your-phones-location-data-without-your-explicit-consent">company that provides your phone service </a>is doing with your data instead. The next time someone calls you about an extended warranty, it's not because they got anything from your old phone — it's because your carrier sold them your name and phone number.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy Watch 8 Classic was reportedly spotted passing through the Bluetooth SIG database for certification.</li><li>The listing directly states the device by name after previous and current rumors agree on its supposed model number.</li><li>There's hope that the Galaxy Watch 8 series will introduce more exciting features, like Samsung's glucose monitoring, which an exec spoke about in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Interest builds around Samsung's next wave of smartwatches, and for good reason as a recent leak might've solidified a previous rumors.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-bluetooth-sig-certified/">XpertPick</a>, Samsung's next Galaxy Watch has reportedly picked up a key certification ahead of its launch. The post states the company's next "Classic" watch has been spotted in the  Bluetooth SIG database. More importantly, this database listing seemingly "confirms" the existence of a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>On the website's "Product list," a device with Samsung's website and a "smart wearable device" product description has been attached to an SM-L505U model.</p><p>The model number in question is tied to a Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which alludes to its return after skipping out in 2024. As the publication notes, the Bluetooth SIG database lacks any further information about the device's specifications. That's not too surprising, considering the nature/purpose of the certification.</p>
<h2 id="switching-up-the-galaxy-watch-2">Switching up the Galaxy Watch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-01.jpg" alt="One of the new watch faces on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tJcLE9Td92zZ82wCWF3q45.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">from earlier in April</a> claimed to have narrowed down the supposed model numbers for Samsung's next Galaxy Watches. Among them, there were two numbers for the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. We've seen one now with the Bluetooth SIG listing, leaving the other still in hiding. Rumors add there might be two size variants for the Watch 8 Classic, while the larger Watch 8 could see four variations.</p><p>On the other hand, the design of the Galaxy Watch 8 series is still up in the air. Some claim that the devices could adopt a more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">square design like Apple</a>. However, the (alleged) existence of a "Classic" leads us toward a circular design, at least for this model. Consumers got their hands on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> in 2023, but missed it last year when Samsung dropped it for the Galaxy Watch Ultra. A key highlight of a "Classic" Galaxy Watch is its rotating bezel, so it seems unlikely that Samsung would shy away from that. This feels even more likely when you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">how furious Samsung's management was</a> with the Ultra.</p><p>Moreover, there's speculation that the Galaxy Watch 8 series could do more than the 7 series ever did, like bring in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">glucose monitoring</a>. A Samsung exec spoke about the topic in January, reiterating its work to develop "non-evasive" glucose monitoring via the Galaxy Watch series. The company's senior vice president, Hon Pak, stated the feature would be "optically-based" and feature a nutrition coaching feature.</p>

<p>Samsung is expected to unveil its new flagship foldables sometime in July, with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 as the star of the show. Samsung essentially pioneered this segment by bringing the first horizontal foldable to the global market, and it hasn't stopped since. It has been getting a bit complacent of late with its lead and has been churning out iterative updates for the past few generations. Meanwhile, others, such as OPPO, have caught up and surpassed Samsung in many areas.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> received a glowing review from our in-house Android expert, Harish Jonnalagadda, who described it as the best foldable he has ever used. That's a big claim considering he has pretty much tested every single one out there, no matter their availability.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> expected to be slimmer and feature improved cameras, can it challenge the Find N5? We have compiled this Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. OPPO Find N5 comparison based on all the available information about Samsung's next foldable, although it remains speculative until the phone is officially announced.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7PksbiS5oVbgs9Pye8kwkk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PksbiS5oVbgs9Pye8kwkk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 crease comparison with their screens on. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is likely going to be an expensive phone. Rumors floating around suggest that it could cost more than the $1,799 starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which wouldn't surprise us.</p><p>If it actually uses all the new tech we expect it to, a $100 price increase is to be expected. As is usually the case with Samsung's launches, the phone will go up for pre-orders once it has been announced, and general availability should be a couple of weeks later. This will vary by region, with certain countries getting it later than others.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 was launched in February 2025 at SGD 2,499, equivalent to approximately $1,900 U.S. The global model is available in a single variant, featuring 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. The main problem here is availability. Except for a few regions, the Find N5 is not available, even in the U.S. This is where Samsung gets to flex its wider market reach as the Fold 7 will most certainly launch in the U.S. and all major global markets.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to get a major design shakeup. Going by the CAD render above, the Fold 7 should be as thin as 4.5mm when unfolded, making it slimmer than even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-is-what-the-z-fold-6-should-have-been">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition (SE)</a>, which only launched in South Korea. The Fold 7 would be the slimmest Fold device yet, but still not as slim as the Find N5, which is 4.2mm when opened.</p><p>The footprint of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is also expected to be slightly larger, as Samsung is anticipated to increase the sizes of both displays. The outer screen is expected to increase to 6.5 inches, while the folding screen is expected to be 8.2 inches. It's still unclear if Samsung will use its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">creaseless foldable panel</a> that it showcased at MWC 2025 in the Fold 7 or if it will save it for a Fold 7 SE, perhaps.</p><p>Another big question mark is whether Samsung will sacrifice S Pen support for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in order to achieve that level of thinness? The Z Fold 6 SE didn't support the S Pen, and for a while, there was talk that the Fold 7 might ditch support too. However, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-7s-fan-favorite-feature-is-here-to-stay">recent rumor</a> now suggests that S Pen support will continue with the Z Fold 7. In fact, Samsung is reportedly working on a new, thicker version of the stylus for the Fold 7.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C67LiPiktwNTxXon7P8go4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What makes the OPPO Find N5 a joy to use is that it doesn't have an awkward in-hand feel when it's closed, thanks to the wider aspect ratio. This makes it look and feel like a regular smartphone, which means apps, typing, and any other interaction feel normal too.</p><p>OPPO has fitted two massive displays on the phone. There's a 6.62-inch OLED outer screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, and an 8.12-inch folding OLED panel with up to 2,100 nits of peak brightness. In our experience testing the phone, OPPO has done a phenomenal job with the displays, as both are equally bright, responsive, and a joy to use.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to get the obvious hardware upgrades, like the shift to the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy SoC for better performance. We're expecting 12GB of RAM once again, with three storage tiers of 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. X <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1909739032264728931">leakster The Galox</a> also suggests that the Fold 7 will have improved dust and water resistance, a larger vapor chamber for cooling, and improved speakers and haptics.</p><p>The battery capacity is expected to stay the same at 4,400mAh, but actual battery life might be better with the more power-efficient chip. Software will also play a big role in determining battery life, and the Fold 7 is expected to launch with One UI 8. This will be based on Android 16, and the Fold 7 should get seven years of OS upgrades.</p>

<p>The OPPO Find N5 delivers amazing performance thanks to the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. There's also ample 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, making this a great media machine. Even though the Find N5 benchmarks lower than a standard phone with the same chip, you'll never notice this difference during actual usage. The phone runs on ColorOS 15, which is based on Android 15. The interface is functional but has a slight learning curve.</p><p>Battery life is one of the Find N5's highlight features as the massive 5,600mAh capacity outlasts pretty much all other foldables, as pointed out by Harish in his review. The secret to this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon battery tech</a> used in the Find N5, which offers better density and longevity.</p><p>Charging speeds are also incredibly quick, with 80W wired and 50W wireless. These are speeds the Galaxy Z Fold 7 can only dream of. The best part is that OPPO bundles the wired charger with the phone.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-oppo-find-n5-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. OPPO Find N5: Cameras</h2>

<p>Samsung is finally expected to upgrade the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. You should expect the same 200MP main sensor found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a>. Many of the leaks so far seem to suggest it, so this might just happen.</p><p>The rest of the sensors probably won't get any change, though, so you should see the 10MP telephoto and 12MP ultrawide accompanying the main camera. We're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">hoping to see an upgraded under-display front camera</a> in the folding screen, which is in desperate need of a quality bump.</p><p>The OPPO Find N5 has an impressive set of rear cameras that deliver excellent details, color reproduction, and telephoto capabilities. For a foldable, Harish deems the N5's cameras to be even better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, which is high praise. The phone also features several AI editing tools, including eraser mode and an unblur option, both of which work exceptionally well.</p>

<p>Based on what we know about the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 so far, the OPPO Find N5 appears to be the better phone, but very few will likely end up buying it. This is because it's hard to get hold of, apart from Singapore and maybe a few other regions. It's also very expensive, which makes it a bit of a gamble if you don't have OPPO's after-sales support where you live.</p><p>Clearly, being the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable</a> is not enough if most can't buy it.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 will likely once again outsell most other foldables for the simple fact that it's more easily available in a lot more regions. We really hope Samsung delivers a knockout upgrade to justify the pricing; otherwise, there will be little incentive to upgrade from an older Fold phone. The launch is not too far away, and I'm sure we should get more substantial leaks by the time July comes around.</p>

<p>Apart from a few leaked renders of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, we don't officially know yet what the new phone will look like or what features it will have. Considering Samsung's cautious approach to its phones over the past few years, it might ultimately resemble the renders after all.</p><p>This is a good thing, as we would finally be getting the edge-to-edge outer display we've all been wanting, among other upgrades. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> should offer enough reason to trade in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>, but the question is, should you do it? We'll be able to answer this for certain once the new phone launches, but till then, we can do a speculative comparison based on what we know and expect from Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phone</a>.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 was launched for $999 in 2023, and last year's Z Flip 6 received a $100 price increase. We're hoping Samsung sticks to last year's pricing and doesn't increase it further, which seems likely. What we'd all love is if Samsung went back to the $999 pricing, which would instantly make the Z Flip 7 more appealing to those who were not even considering it in the first place.</p><p>Aside from the usual spec upgrades, we hope that Samsung finally equips the Z Flip 7 with faster charging, although this seems unlikely. It has begun doing so with its mid-range A series phones, so it'd be laughable if its flagship series still had 25W charging. I'm not pinning my hopes too much on a significantly larger battery, although a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-give-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-a-battery-boost">mild bump</a> is to be expected. The big changes should hopefully be in the phone's design and display.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-alleged-renders" alt="Camera design update on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2mDbY2B8NDmcTp5RaTK8k.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">slightly larger 6.8-inch folding display</a>, and depending on what aspect ratio changes are made, the phone will either be a bit taller or wider when opened. We should expect a brighter screen, and perhaps more sturdier ultra-thin glass (UTG) capable of handling more folds and unfolds.</p><p>The big change we're all curious to see is if Samsung actually goes with a larger, edge-to-edge cover display this time. If it hopes to compete in sales with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola's Razr Plus</a>, it had better do it well.</p><p>The cover display on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is expected to enclose the two cameras in a manner similar to many other flip phones. The big question is, will Samsung limit the functionality to just widgets, or will you be able to use full-fledged apps too? The latter is possible even on the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and 6, but not without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">jumping through hoops</a>. I believe Samsung should at least offer the option to do so for those who want to, rather than dictating what can and cannot be done.</p><p>If the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is anything like the renders, we're in for a boxier design this generation. The corners are less rounded than the Galaxy Z Flip 5, and the sides appear to be flatter and sharper. There's a possibility that the Flip 7 could be less comfortable to hold than the Flip 5, but we'll wait and see.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-5-review-6.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 in Flex Mode with the camera on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AAwomDWq3tVr5PYr4x5K7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3602" height="2026" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Cameras are an area where we're confident the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will best the Galaxy Z Flip 5. The latter has two 12MP sensors on the outside, which are serviceable but not great in terms of capturing very good details. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 will most likely have a 50MP main camera like the Flip 6, but the sensor is still unknown. I'm hoping the ultrawide also gets a resolution bump to 50MP for better low-light performance.</p><p>Samsung has stuck to a 10MP camera in the folding screen for the past few generations, and it's expected to use a similar one for the Flip 7. We can hope for a larger sensor, but for the kind of usage this inner camera gets, it's not a deal-breaker if Samsung sticks to the same sensor.</p><p>More than the hardware, we should expect new Galaxy AI camera features to debut with the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Some of them should roll over to the Flip 6, but I wouldn't expect many to come to the Z Flip 5.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-one-ui-8-preloaded/">reportedly</a> launch with One UI 8, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. The fact that Samsung is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">testing</a> this next version on the Galaxy S25 series, there's a strong chance we might see this debut with the Galaxy Flip 7. It's still too early to tell what new features we can expect, but I estimate it shouldn't be wildly different from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, which was a big overhaul to begin with.</p><p>The performance of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 should be miles ahead of the Galaxy Z Flip 5, thanks to the latest processor. There were talks that the 7 might have an Exynos SoC, but it's possible Samsung will stick to the custom 'Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy' chip from the S25 series.</p><p>The Flip 7 should also have 12GB RAM as standard, which should make the latest software feel more responsive and snappy compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 5. The latter's Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 is still a solid chip for powering through your social and productivity apps, but heavier games should fare better on the Flip 7's newer processor.</p><p>Then there's the concern of battery life. Samsung has to fight certain restrictions on battery capacity due to the very nature of a folding phone, so we're not expecting a massive jump in capacity. We already have that with the Flip 6, and the Flip 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-give-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-a-battery-boost">expected to take it a bit further</a>.</p>

<p>Samsung has made this decision a lot easier by essentially killing off the Galaxy Z Flip 5 from its online store. Samsung U.S. displays a "sold out" message for the Flip 5 and directs you to check out the Flip 6 instead. You can still find the Z Flip 5 on Amazon, but at the same $999 price tag, which is absurd to pay in 2025.</p><p>If Samsung were officially selling it at a lower price, it could be a good low-cost alternative, but Motorola already has you covered with its latest offerings. Additionally, Samsung allegedly plans to introduce a budget flip phone, rumored to be called the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-hold-back-the-budget-galaxy-z-flip-7-model-until-late-2025">Q4 2025 release</a>.</p><p>Debating between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-galaxy-z-flip-6">Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is a lot more interesting as the Flip 6 won't be phased out so soon, and it could drop in price once the Flip 7 is out. In any case, you'll have to wait for Samsung's official announcement before making your decision, and we'll be right here where more great content around the Z Flip 7 to help you with that.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus announced today (Apr. 28) that it will be changing the price for its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3 </a>down to $349.99 in the U.S.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">the company opened sales</a> for a watch with an eye-watering $500 price tag only in the U.S., while all other countries where the watch was being sold kept the original price.</p><p>While we didn't receive any official word from the company regarding the reasoning behind the unexpected price increase for the wearable, it was assumed that it had something to do with the U.S.-China trade war, specifically President Trump's imposition of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/04/10/business/trump-tariffs-stocks" target="_blank">145% tariff</a> on products imported from China.</p><p>However, it was later announced that all electronics were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">exempted</a> from these tariffs, which came as a relief to many.</p>

<p>In an email to Android Central, the company's Head of Marketing & Communications, Spenser Blank, confirmed that the price was "increased to $499.99 in the U.S. due to the current market conditions."</p><p>Without getting into the details of the tariffs situation, Blank said that OnePlus made recent adjustments to its supply chain, which has allowed it to bring back with reduced prices for the Watch 3 in the U.S.</p><p>"The OnePlus Watch 3 in the U.S. is now available at its new price of $349.99; this is the final MSRP price and will not be changed going forward," Blank added.</p>

<p>The company also stated that it will be refunding the additional $170 for those who bought the Watch 3 for $499.99 this month.</p><p>"OnePlus will refund them the difference to their original payment method, and they will be contacted directly by the OnePlus Customer Support team."</p><p>"This change reflects our effort to be transparent, responsive, and committed to bringing the OnePlus Watch 3 to the U.S at a competitive price point, despite the ongoing market conditions."

<ul><li>Nothing launches Buds 2 for £39/₹2,699/€49, Buds 2 Plus for £49/₹3,299/€59, and Buds 2a for £29/₹2,199/€39.</li><li>The pre-orders begin April 28; open sales start May 6 through Nothing's website and retail outlets.</li><li>Users can easily choose from three models tailored to different needs and budgets.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ending the month of April this year, Nothing has announced a bunch of new products under its budget-friendly brand CMF, including the Phone 2 Pro next to the Buds 2 series and Buds 2a.</p><p>The new Buds line-up from CMF this year includes multiple products available for multiple price points, making it accessible to all and that too in an affordable price range as the brand itself originally resonates with. Nothing notes that each model balances performance, design, and promises more control over the audio listening experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XrVDSjiQiLX4yCsAHSQ9q9" name="CMF-Buds-2-series-01" alt="CMF Buds 2 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XrVDSjiQiLX4yCsAHSQ9q9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Firstly, the Buds 2 series contains CMF Buds 2 and a Plus model, and the former claims to be a "versatile companion" for everyday use by offering great sound, comfort, and smart features. The Buds 2 are Dirac Opteo-tuned and include 48dB hybrid ANC and Spatial Audio effect.</p><p>The Buds 2 Plus, on the other hand, ups its game over the Buds 2 with the inclusion of Hi-Res LDAC, 50dB hybrid ANC, and full EQ customization. Lastly, the Buds 2a is a lightweight entry-level offering from the company that also promises high-quality audio, including 42 dB ANC and a 12.4mm bio-fibre driver with deep bass.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FodCsByep5kda2UrM5z4q9" name="CMF-Buds-2-Plus" alt="CMF Buds 2 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FodCsByep5kda2UrM5z4q9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF by Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the battery front, the Buds 2 are primed with 13.5 hours of playback and 55 hours with the case included and ANC turned off. And a quick ten-minute charge could give users 7.5 hours of listening time.</p><p>The Plus model, meanwhile, offers 14 hours of playback on a single charge and an additional 61.5 hours with the case and ANC disabled. Both Buds 2 series are equipped with 6HD microphones, accompanied by Environmental Noise Cancellation, and Noise Reduction 3.0 to ensure clarity in calls in breezy environments.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-52">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a fresh take on budget phones, standing out with a sleek, slim design and vibrant colors.</li><li>Packed with a MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip, a 6.77-inch AMOLED screen, and a 5000mAh battery, this phone is built for heavy use without the constant charging.</li><li>CMF also unveiled new earbuds for all budgets: Buds 2 for everyday use, Buds 2 Plus for audiophiles, and Buds 2a for budget-conscious bass lovers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>CMF by Nothing is back at it, and this time, it's bringing some serious heat. Today, the sub-brand launched the CMF Phone 2 Pro and a fresh batch of earbuds: Buds 2, Buds 2 Plus, and Buds 2a.</p><p>Nothing has been doing what a lot of brands aren’t: actually making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a> feel fresh. You see it right away with the CMF Phone 2 Pro. It doesn’t follow the usual boring playbook — it’s slim, light, and the colors actually pop instead of playing it safe.</p><p>The CMF brand is basically Nothing’s way of keeping prices low without totally ditching its signature look.</p><p>Under the hood, it’s rocking the new MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro chip, plus a big 6.77-inch AMOLED screen that can hit 3000 nits of brightness. And with a 5000mAh battery, you’re good to go for hours of heavy use without worrying about charging.</p>
<h2 id="lighter-faster-and-just-plain-cooler-2">Lighter, faster, and just plain cooler</h2>
<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro is a step up in design. At just 7.8mm thick and weighing only 185g, it’s the lightest phone Nothing has ever put out.</p><p>The Phone 2 Pro rocks an aluminum frame with some sharp stainless-steel details. Furthermore, it’s way more water-resistant now, sporting an IP54 rating, a notch above last year’s model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DuK2ABATVrbLZF9vpWfKe9" name="CMF-Phone-2-Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro in all colors alongside its accessories" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuK2ABATVrbLZF9vpWfKe9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: CMF)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The real standout is the camera setup. The 50MP main camera now pulls in 64% more light than before, as per Nothing. Add in a 20x digital zoom with a telephoto lens, and you’re getting some serious magnification. There’s also an 8MP ultra-wide snapper and a 16MP selfie camera.</p><p>Design-wise, the Phone 2 Pro takes a fresh turn with separate camera lenses instead of one big module. It’s now got a triple-lens setup, though we’re still not sure if a non-Pro version with just two cameras will drop too. The back also gets a dual-tone finish, which really pops, especially in the white color.</p><p>You’ll be able to grab it in four colors: the usual Black and White, Orange, and Light Green. The bright orange back still pops with a bold intensity, making the exposed screws stand out even more. The rotating dial at the bottom is also sticking around.</p>

<p>What’s a bit unusual about this launch is that Nothing has once again skipped the regular model. It did the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and 3a Pro</a>, dropping them before we even heard about the base Phone 3. Now, with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, there’s no standard CMF Phone 2.</p>
<h2 id="the-buds-trio-2">The buds trio</h2>
<p>Alongside the CMF Phone 2 Pro, Nothing has dropped a fresh set of wireless earbuds that cover all kinds of budgets and sound needs. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-cmf-buds-2-are-now-available-as-it-teases-the-cmf-phone-2-pro">Buds 2 are great for everyday use</a>, with Dirac Opteo boosting sound quality, 48dB hybrid Active Noise Cancellation, and a Spatial Audio effect.</p><p>For the audiophiles out there, the Buds 2 Plus bring high-res audio with LDAC support and full control over the equalizer to fine-tune your music. And if you’re after something affordable, the Buds 2a deliver solid 42dB Active Noise Cancellation and punchy bass.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the new CMF Phone 2 Pro, Buds 2, Buds 2 Plus, and Buds 2a kick off today, April 28, with full sales starting on May 6 at nothing.tech and select retailers.</p><p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro will set you back £219 / ₹18,999 / €249 for the 8+128GB model, and £249 / ₹20,999 / €279 / $279 (U.S. Beta Program only) for the 8+256GB version. As for the buds, the Buds 2 go for £39 / ₹2,699 / €49 / $59, the Buds 2 Plus for £49 / ₹3,299 / €59 / $69, and the Buds 2a for £29 / ₹2,199 / €39 / $49.</p><p>You can also grab some extra accessories like the Universal Cover, additional Lenses, and the Wallet/Stand, but keep in mind, these are in limited stock, so it’s a good idea to pick them up quickly if you're interested.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Not the upgrade you want</strong></em></p><p>The DiskStation DS925+ brings several key upgrades, such as dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports at the back, and a quad-core Ryzen platform. The result is that the NAS has a definite edge over the DS923+ if you need a little bit of additional power, but the gains are overshadowed by a controversial HDD policy. Essentially, you can't use any other brand's HDDs with the DS925+, and that severely restricts your choices. Not being able to use regular Seagate and WD drives, and having to buy costlier Synology-branded hard drives just doesn't make sense, and it ultimately makes the DS925+ a non-starter. </p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Still a great choice</strong></em></p><p>If you have to choose a model from these two, I'd suggest going with the DiskStation DS923+. It uses a dual-core Ryzen platform, but it's plenty fast in daily use, and you get the best software platform around. Although the DS923+ is a few years old at this point, the NAS doesn't have any limitations beyond the Gigabit Ethernet ports, and if you need multi-Gigabit connectivity, you can upgrade to a 10GbE card without a hassle. And considering there are no restrictions around HDD use, the DS923+ makes better sense than the DS925+ — so grab it while it's still available. </p></p>

<p>Synology hasn't changed its design in 10 years, so both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">DiskStation DS925+</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a> are practically identical. They both use the same black chassis with a vented design at the sides to allow passive cooling, and there are dual 92mm fans at the rear. <br><br>The design is unobtrusive, and the aluminum construction means it is durable. I haven't had any issues with the DS923+ whatsoever even with extended use, and the DS925+ should be the same. The power button is located on the right, and you get status LED indicators and a USB-A port on the same side.</p>

<p>The drive bays are easy to access, and they can be locked should you wish to do so. Installing 3.5-inch HDDs is about as straightforward as it gets, and it doesn't require any tools. If you need to slot in a 2.5-inch SSD instead, you'll need to mount it to the drive bay.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9KeYecHjbYfmJiXSqec6un" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-5.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9KeYecHjbYfmJiXSqec6un.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching to the back, you get a USB port as standard, and the underside of both NAS servers has two M.2 slots if you want to add SSDs. The DiskStation DS925+ is notable as it comes with two 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports, giving it a good upgrade over the DS923+, which has Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. The DS925+ also uses USB-C to expand drives should you need to down the line, with the DS923+ coming with an eSATA port instead.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it's great to see multi-Gigabit connectivity available by default, the DS925+ doesn't have a way to switch to 10GbE networking — unlike the DS923+. You can easily add a 10GbE card to the DS923+ thanks to the connector at the rear, and it gives the NAS greater flexibility.</p>

<p>Both NAS models have the exact same software, so there isn't anything to differentiate either product in this area. That said, the DiskStation DS925+ comes with a quad-core Ryzen V1500B, and it holds up better with demanding workloads. That isn't to say that the DS923+ is any slouch in this area — it's just that the DS925+ has a little additional headroom. The rest of the hardware is identical, with both NAS systems coming with 4GB RAM pre-installed. <br><br>The main reason to buy Synology NAS servers is the DiskStation Manager (DSM) software, and the brand continues to do a great job delivering useful features and standout mobile clients. It's effortless to upload photos and data from your phones automatically to either NAS, and you get powerful utilities that provide a local alternative to cloud-based solutions. <br><br>The biggest issue with the DiskStation DS925+ is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-brings-severe-hard-drive-limitations-to-diskstation-models-and-im-pissed">limitation around hard drive use</a>. While you can use any Seagate IronWolf, WD Red, or any other hard drive in the DiskStation DS923+, that isn't possible with the DS925+; Synology is now enforcing the use of its own drives, and unless you do so, you won't even be able to install the DSM software and boot into the NAS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cqTszDpeHcMnwvPsAUgKvL" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqTszDpeHcMnwvPsAUgKvL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This arbitrary restriction has huge ramifications, as Synology's drives tend to cost more than their equivalent Seagate and Western Digital rivals. The brand says it is doing this to ensure greater reliability, but it hasn't published any meaningful data around how its drives last longer than other NAS HDDs. <br><br>Both servers do a good job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex NAS</a>; there are no issues with playback, and remote streaming is easy to set up and use. That said, the AMD-based hardware doesn't come with transcoding, so you miss out on this feature. That's true with both the DS925+ and DS923+, so if you use Plex Pass and need transcoding,</p>

<p>It just doesn't make much sense to buy the DiskStation DS925+. While it has better hardware and multi-Gigabit connectivity out of the box, the hard drive restrictions curb its usability to a noticeable extent. Don't get me wrong; the DS925+ is still a great NAS, and if you don't care about the hard drive limitations, you should consider getting it. <br><br>But with the DiskStation DS923+ still available, the older NAS is a better choice in 2025. While the Gigabit Ethernet ports are showing their age, you can add a 10GbE networking card by shelling out an additional $100, and there are no restrictions around HDD use — you can buy any Seagate, Toshiba, and WD drive you want and slot it into the NAS. <br><br>Given the changes with the DS925+, I'd suggest getting the DS923+ while it's still available. It continues to be a reliable 4-bay Plex NAS in 2025, and it isn't intentionally hobbled.</p>

<p>First, I picked through the runner summaries COROS sent for Yalemzerf Yehualaw (3rd place), Emma Bates (13th), Des Linden (17th), Charlie Sweeney (19th), and Reed Fischer (21st), all top-tier runners for one of the most famous races in the world.</p><p>All of COROS' Boston Marathon team wore either the $349 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a> (Linden) or $229 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-3-review">COROS PACE 3</a> (Bates, Yalemzerf, Sweeney). It's pretty cool knowing they use the same tools as everyday runners to analyze their own stats — and that you can directly compare your data against theirs to provide humbling context and insight.</p><p>COROS was also kind enough to send a spreadsheet of per-mile stats for Bates, Fischer, and Linden for their pace, cadence, average/ max heart rate, and the changes from one mile to the next — or lack thereof — is fascinating and enlightening.</p><p>Here's what I gleaned from looking through these pro runner stats!</p>
<h2 id="consistency-is-vital-2">Consistency is vital</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1167px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.21%;"><img id="c7ELnAoa6Apf82YPsdzsy9" name="Reed-Fischer-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Reed Fischer's per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025 and 2022." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c7ELnAoa6Apf82YPsdzsy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1167" height="656" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Reed Fischer's per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025 and 2022 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From miles 2 through 16, Reed Fischer's pace never changed by more than 6 seconds. And from mile 5 onwards, his average heart rate stayed in the same 170–176 range — while his average and max HR were almost always within 1–2 bpm.</p><p>Des Linden's average cadence fell between 188–191 steps per minute for the entire race until the final 0.2-mile sprint to the finish. Even when her pace dipped and stride lost power, she kept the same speed of her form, and her per-mile pace was remarkably consistent even across elevation changes.</p><p>I don't have Yehualaw's per-mile stats, but it's very telling that the gap between her fastest and average kilometer is only 20 seconds. And Linden, a role model for running longevity at 43, only had a 5-second gap between her mile-1 and mile-26 times, and a 33-second gap between her fastest and slowest mile.</p><p>These stats are a great reminder that you don't want to let your fellow runners dictate your pace. Even when you're in the zone and feeling great, you must restrain yourself, stick within your capabilities, and keep your heart pumping to the beat of a metronome.</p>
<h2 id="you-re-probably-trying-too-hard-2">You're probably trying too hard</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1330px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eDdaY4S4hifQmPbsAevC5A" name="Emma-Bates-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Emma Bates' per-mile stats for the past three Boston Marathons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eDdaY4S4hifQmPbsAevC5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1330" height="748" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Emma Bates' per-mile stats for the Boston Marathon in 2025, 2024, and 2023 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't know these athletes' actual max HRs or lactate thresholds, but the "220 minus age" estimate shows me that all these runners were <em>probably</em> running, on average, right at the border between Zone 4 and 5 for most of their run. That's certainly not easy, but they rarely approach their max effort.</p><p>In fact, their heart rate tends to <em>dip</em> in the final miles; they ease off their pace to stick to what their bodies are capable of.</p><p>COROS has an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/stories/athlete-stories/c/effort-pace-the-journey-of-coros-metric-of-the-future">"Effort Pace"</a> metric that combines grade-adjusted pace (GAP) with your ability level to judge how hard you're working to hit a pace and adjusting the speed accordingly. By and large, these runners' effort pace was almost always lower than their <em>real</em> pace; they didn't push harder than their usual abilities, even for the biggest race of the year.</p><p>Fischer's first four miles did show a higher effort pace than actual pace, which I'd guess stems from him trying to stick with the faster leaders for the first 5K. Once he fell behind, his pace became more efficient and within his means.</p><p>Our goal, then, should be to keep at a similarly consistent heart rate and foot speed for our races rather than trying to outperform our capabilities and burn out in the later miles. If you want to go faster, build up your speed and endurance until you can naturally maintain a faster cadence.</p>
<h2 id="there-s-no-shortcut-for-getting-faster-2">There's no shortcut for getting faster</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2034px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.43%;"><img id="cqvYdCxfBVPLuRMfh9FCAA" name="Des-Linden-running-stats-boston-marathon" alt="A spreadsheet of COROS running stats showing Des Linden's per-mile stats for the past five Boston Marathons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqvYdCxfBVPLuRMfh9FCAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2034" height="680" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Des Linden's per-mile stats for five Boston Marathons from 2021–2025 (<em>click the box to zoom in</em>). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I averaged about 25 spm fewer than Charley Sweeney (who is my height) in my recent half-marathon PR, or 14 spm fewer during a max-effort interval workout. That's not a surprise or anything; just like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-i-challenged-olympics-track-and-field-athletes-and-why-you-should-too">I tried to match Olympic paces on my local track</a>, I know my running capabilities are firmly amateur.</p><p>But it did tempt me to consider whether I should try to change my running form to aim for faster step speed...until I remembered the time I asked Garmin Forerunner product manager Joe Heikes<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form"> how to improve my running form</a>. He basically warned me <em>not</em> to.</p><p>Any self-correction to change your natural form will lead to "less economical running," Heikes said, and runners should instead use form data like cadence as a benchmark; the lighter, faster, and stronger you get, the less wasted movement and slow turnover you should see without any conscious changes.</p><p>If there <em>is</em> a way to improve your form, it's with strength training to make your muscles capable of the extra impact. COROS coaches suggest burpees, mountain climbers, and other bodyweight jumps for faster ground contact time and lower-body exercises like squats, deadlifts, and calf/heel raises for a stronger stride.</p><p>The main point being, if I want to emulate these athletes' foot speed, it's arguably just as much about strength as endurance. These stats were a bit of a wake-up call to stop neglecting my cross-training.</p>
<h2 id="emulating-their-approach-only-slower-2">Emulating their approach (only slower)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ" name="Four-watches-20-mile-running-test" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2, Garmin Fenix 8, COROS PACE Pro, and Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting on a bookshelf together, all showing a post-run summary for a 20-mile race that day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbBmCdQNRuocVTfNQAaNuZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I finished my 20-mile race about an hour slower than these runners finished a marathon.

<p>Plenty of amateur runners will look at these stats and get discouraged, knowing they couldn't run one mile as fast as these athletes' <em>slowest</em> Boston Marathon mile.</p><p>I look at it differently. I know that I can't run that fast, obviously, but I <em>can</em> emulate their race tactics.</p><p>My per-mile efficiency or performance condition stats show the turning point when I have to start using more effort at a higher heart rate than I should; the goal is to push that point further back.</p><p>During a race, I need to practice consistent pace and heart rate habits. Rather than just sink into the zone and run at a pace that feels right until my legs give out, I can use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a> data to stay at a pace I can manage, particularly in the early miles when it's easy to get carried away.</p>

While the free tier has an exhaustive feature-set in its own right, you'll need to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/plex-pass">Plex Pass</a> to unlock the best utility, including hardware-assisted transcoding, ability to download content on mobile devices, advanced controls, and skip intros — what I use the most. <br><br>Plex Pass costs $4.99 a month, $39.99 annually, and is available as a lifetime sub that'll set you back $119.99. These prices have been unchanged for the better part of a decade, but Plex is now starting to raise prices across the board. Starting April 29, the monthly plan will cost $6.99, yearly plan is going up to $69.99, and the lifetime option will cost $249.99. <br><br>In addition to the price hike, Plex is moving the oft-used remote streaming option behind Plex Pass, so you will need to subscribe to a paid plan if you share your Plex library with your friends or family. The good news is that the older pricing is still available, so if you use the service and want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/">subscribe to the lifetime plan at $119.99</a>, now is the best time to do it. <br><br>I bought Plex Pass a half-decade ago while it was under $100, and it has easily paid for itself in that time. While I don't use the transcoding option, all the other value additions with Plex Pass make it an easy recommendation, and given that sharing your library requires the paid sub, I'd suggest getting in on the old pricing before April 29. <br><br>On that note, Plex <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/blog/important-2025-plex-updates/">clarified in a blog post</a> that if you're sharing your library, only you'll need Plex Pass; those you share it with will be able to access it on the free tier. That's the right move, so if you've relied on this feature in the past, you may want to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.plex.tv/plex-pass/">getting Plex Pass right now</a>.</p>

<p>Motorola just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">unveiled</a> its new Razr 2025 series, and the company is taking a page out of Samsung's book in North America by launching a trio of devices. After the previous two generations only came with two phones, I think Motorola was smart to tweak its lineup for a more aggressive strategy, and Samsung may want to take note.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a> comprises the base Razr 2025, the Razr Plus 2025, and the Razr Ultra 2025. The latter is the newest addition to the lineup, offering premium specs with a premium price tag. The entire lineup spans a wide range of prices, starting at $699 and ranging up to $ 1,299. By contrast, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which comprises a base S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra, ranges from $799 to $1,299 as the starting prices for each model.</p><p>When I asked Motorola why it decided on three Razr devices for 2025, it said that it's “expanding the family to provide consumers with more options at various price points.”</p><p>This makes sense as Motorola is known for offering devices with plenty of value at a lower price point (Razr 2025) while the company is also trying to better establish itself in the premium Android market (Razr Ultra 2025). This gives Motorola a broad reach with consumers, something Samsung has capitalized on with its flagship series.</p>
<h2 id="three-s-company-2">Three's company</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By now, we're accustomed to Samsung offering three flagship models (excluding the upcoming Edge), a trend it has maintained for several generations. Apparently, it works out well for the company; otherwise, it would have ditched the strategy long ago. In fact, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, Samsung appears poised to double down on this strategy, highlighting how more choice is indeed better.</p><p>Yet, despite the similar naming strategy, Motorola isn't copying Samsung completely. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> phones offer different specs, from the chipset to the camera setup, which is how Motorola has been able to bring the price lower than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. After all, we are dealing with foldable phones here, which often cost more than traditional candybar phones.</p><p>Motorola updated the Razr 2025 chip with the AI-ready <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">Dimensity 7400X</a>, which isn't an expensive flagship chip, but a more cost-effective midrange chip that should be more than capable for a $700 phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-1" alt="The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7bNDiJnnfpHtFReerYVuDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2327" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Razr 2025 next to the Razr 2024. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anshel Sag, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, agrees, noting that Motorola now has the sales volume to support a three-product lineup.</p><p>“They are also moving up market with a true flagship model that beats the competition in every spec while still offering more affordable alternatives, creating the halo effect,” Sag tells me in an email.</p><p>That “true flagship model” costs a whopping $1,299, which is a $300 premium over last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> and $200 more than the already-expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>. It also costs the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, despite offering significantly better specs, including more RAM, increased base storage, and faster charging, among other advantages.</p><p>That's a pretty penny that could give some consumers pause. However, this may not be as much of a deterrent as I initially thought it would be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“I don’t think it will be much of a problem since the company is offering a sliding scale of capabilities and for those who care for the specs, the Ultra is the perfect model,” Sag explains. “The Ultra is very competitive as a flagship, and I think [it] will get the brand a lot of attention.”</p><p>Like Samsung, Motorola clearly wants you to buy its premium offering, while still making it easy for you to get a similar experience with two cheaper models based on what you can afford and what you want out of your phone. Even if that means making meager changes with the Razr and Razr Plus.</p>
<h2 id="middle-child-syndrome-2">Middle child syndrome</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Jzmc9pbgmjbDYe3mh5kaK3" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025-hands-on" alt="Different colors and finishes of the Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jzmc9pbgmjbDYe3mh5kaK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Razr 2025 introduced a few notable changes, including a larger battery and an updated chipset. However, the Razr Plus 2025 is largely the same as last year's Plus model in terms of specs. Just by looking at it, you'd think they were the same phone (because they almost are).</p><p>This was the biggest question mark for me with Razr’s new strategy. We've definitely complained about companies making very few changes with their new phones, and this kinda takes the cake. That's not to say it isn't a good phone; I still love my Razr Plus 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola made sure to point out to me how this 2025 model is still an upgrade from its predecessor.</p><p>“The key improvements include the suite of new Moto AI experiences, the redesigned titanium-reinforced hinge, the first flip phones with Pantone validated color and skin tones, and robust IP48 dust and underwater protection."</p><p>That's not nothing, and the Pantone-enhanced display and cameras actually sound pretty good to me. However, like Samsung's Galaxy S Plus devices, I worry that the new Razr Plus will fall into that same awkward middle child situation.</p><p>Sag says that while this is true to a lesser extent, “the Razr Plus is far more differentiated from the Ultra than the Samsung models are.” Basically, for anyone who still want a flagship-esque experience without paying more than $1,000, this is the phone for you.</p><p>On the other hand, Sag notes that Galaxy Plus phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>, are probably a better deal, as they typically utilize the same chipset as their Ultra counterparts, rather than a less powerful version, which allows for price reductions in other areas.</p>
<h2 id="now-it-s-samsung-s-turn-2">Now it’s Samsung’s turn</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-render-closed" alt="A leaked look at a minty green Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE closed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1668" height="938" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sag believes that Motorola’s new Razr 2025 series still offers great value in regions like China, and “especially in the US market where foldable competition is weak.”</p><p>This gives me hope that Motorola may execute this three-product strategy successfully, leveraging its strengths as a company that still knows how to undercut the competition while also proving it can truly compete with the big boys.</p><p>This is something I think Samsung needs to emulate with its foldable phones. Every year, the company launches one large-screened foldable and a smaller flip phone, and both have done well for the company. However, with last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 6 price hike and the expected price increase for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung will need to continue to offer options that are within reach for consumers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-01" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 and Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CAc8Q22Rwng8nscAwdFLaa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We’ve written about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-really-needs-to-build-a-cheap-flip-phone">Samsung needs to launch a Galaxy Z Flip FE</a>, and we may finally get one this year, with Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">rumored</a> to use a less powerful chipset (among other changes) to achieve a cheaper price tag.</p><p>That’s definitely a start, and we would love to see something similar with the Fold series, with an option that costs a few hundred dollars less to help drive adoption. And just like last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-is-what-the-z-fold-6-should-have-been">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a>, the company could offer some type of ultra-premium model for both Flip and Fold devices for the people who are willing to spend more on the latest and greatest.</p><p>With foldables becoming more mainstream, offering consumers more choices feels like the best option for companies, especially in the U.S., where there are already so few when compared to other regions. So, where Motorola is doing the smart thing by emulating Samsung, Samsung and others need to follow suit and give us more, and not limit us to just one foldable model a year.</p>

The judge presiding over the latest antitrust case hasn't said much about it either way but some politicians seem to think it's the correct way to punish Google for the financial indiscretions it has committed. (<em>Editor's note: are these considered crimes? Let me know what you think in the comments</em>).</p><p>I don't think this is going to happen and my dad always used to tell me it's good to want things. Part of me wants to see Google smacked hard so it stops doing shady stuff, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">smarter part of me</a> knows that there aren't really any companies that could maintain projects like Android or Chrome without being equally, or even more, shady. It's a good thing I'm not in charge of anything.</p>

<p>To make this thing even more of a spectacle, Yahoo! (never forget the !) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/655975/yahoo-search-web-browser-prototype-google-trial-antitrust-chrome" target="_blank">has thrown its hat into the ring </a>and stated that it too would like to "buy" Chrome should Google be forced to sell. I'll give you a moment to remember who Yahoo is and to stop laughing.</p><p>Yahoo has become the quintessential tech failure story. Believe it or not, at one time Yahoo had the power over the web that Google currently has; huge market share, investors and potential partners climbing over each other to grab a bite, and a seemingly endless potential. We saw how that turned out.</p><p>Today Yahoo is a shell of its former self and even the execs at the company are aware of it. One of the big reasons, in its own estimation, is that it lacks any sort of first-party web browser. Well, OK, a real web browser: Yahoo's real owner, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apollo.com/" target="_blank">Apollo Global Management</a>, happens to also own NetScape. You might have heard of it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:347px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.42%;"><img id="p4wxh5NxfuxFjRTDDmquJa" name="Netscape" alt="Netscape Browser window at full size in 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p4wxh5NxfuxFjRTDDmquJa.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="347" height="286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: By User:Ericd, Fair use, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86883" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?curid=86883</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I get its reasoning, 100%. You might, too, even if you don't know you get it. It has to do with the way web searches are done.</p><p>You can open up a web browser, go to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/" target="_blank">Google.com</a>, and type a search into the box in the center of the screen. Millions of people do just that every hour.</p><p>You can also open up a web browser (most of them, anyway) and just type in your search.</p><p>Both get the same results from the same place, one way just saved you some typing and page loading. Yahoo knows how important this is and is said to be actively developing its own browser anyway. I'd bet money that it will be a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-internet-actually-better-android-browser-chrome">Chromium-based browser</a> like most others, too. At least I hope Yahoo doesn't think it can reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Is this good or bad? I'll answer with another question: Can it be both?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apollo Media Group owns a bunch of stuff from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ncl.com/" target="_blank">Norwegian Cruise Lines</a> to web/cloud security provider and hosting company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rackspace.com/" target="_blank">Rackspace</a>. It has the money that would be needed to maintain the Chrome project.</p><p>It would also most likely shape Chrome's future to its own benefit. At least I would expect that to happen should Chrome fall under its umbrella.</p><p>This highlights the real problem corporations that probably shouldn't have so much control over the web, like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, or Google, are the ones with the financial means to lose money year after year building Chrome and its software ecosystem.</p><p>Companies that should be in charge, like Mozilla or Duck Duck Go, can't afford it. Don't get me started on companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/chatgpt-chief-says-openai-would-buy-chrome-if-google-is-selling">Perplexity or OpenAI having any sort of control</a> over anything more important than a TV remote. It's bad enough seeing Google holding it.</p>
<p>Yahoo needs Chrome but it most certainly doesn't need it to be affiliated with Google.  Google needs Chrome because it likes money, and some people say it uses Chrome to extort even more of it away from the competition. We need Chrome, but we don't need it to be affiliated with <em>any </em>web search platform.</p><p>I have no idea what will happen and as I've said, I don't think an American judge would ever force an American company to sell off an American asset, especially in the current political and financial climate. And yes, I know that America is more than the United States and <strong>you</strong> know what I mean.</p><p>I just thought seeing Yahoo jump into the mix was worth thinking and talking about for at least a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>There's a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr </a>on the block.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2025 series arrived this week as a trio for the first time. Showcasing the standard Motorola Razr, the Motorola Razr Plus, and an all-new Motorola Razr Ultra. All three devices are bolstered with Moto AI, which is backed by Perplexity AI. The devices also have access to Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini</a> suite as well.</p><p>At first glance, the phones look a lot like the previous models. Motorola says that the devices showcase a new titanium-reinforced hinge plate, which is 4x stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel. This is paired with an ultra-thin glass that creates a smoother display on these devices. All three models come with Android 15 out of the box, and with an IP48 dust and water resistance.</p><p><strong>Razr Ultra:</strong></p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 </a>arrives with bigger displays when compared to the other two in the lineup. The device features a 4-inch pOLED cover display and a 7-inch main foldable AMOLED display, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic.</p><p>The Razr Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, comes with a 4,700 mAh battery, featuring a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP ultrawide/macro vision camera, and a third 50MP selfie camera.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes in four colorways: Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret. With its premium specs, the Ultra starts at $1,299 and comes with dual storage options of 512GB and 1TB, along with 16GB of RAM.</p><p><strong>Razr Plus: </strong></p><p>Razr's premium model just got demoted to being the middle child. This year's Plus variant comes with almost the same specs as last year. With an interactive 4-inch cover display and a 6.9-inch internal foldable pOLED display. The Razr Plus 2025 comes in three colorways: Pantone Mocha Mousse, Midnight Blue, and Hot Pink.</p><p>The only visible difference is the device's brightness limit. While the cover display achieves 2,400 nits of peak brightness, the main internal display reaches 3,000 nits. At the heart of the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-gen-3-announced">Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 </a>chipset, similar to the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch"> Razr Plus 2024. </a>It gets a 50MP primary camera, a 50MP 2x telephoto lens, and a 32MP front-facing camera.  The device has a 256GB built-in storage and 12GB of RAM. As of now, this device will only be available in the U.S. for $999.99.</p>

<p><strong>Razr 2025: </strong></p><p>As for its standard model, the company is keeping it simple while also integrating some premium specs into it. The Motorola Razr 2025 arrives in different finishes and four colorways: Pantone Spring Bud, Pantone Gibraltar Sea, Pantone Parfait Pink, and Pantone Lightest Sky.</p><p>The standard model features a smaller 3.6-inch pOLED cover display and the same internal 6.9-inch AMOLED screen. At its core, the phone is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a>, a notch higher than its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">predecessor</a>. Regarding its rear cameras, the standard model features a 50MP primary camera system and a 13MP ultra-wide camera equipped with a Macro Vision lens. The device retains its 32MP front camera from its predecessor.</p><p>The standard model is priced at $699.99, with prices varying based on the carrier in the U.S. and Canada. The Motorola Razr 2025 series will be sold in stores starting May 15. Pre-orders begin on May 7 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Motorola's online store.</p><p>Along with its clamshells, the company also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-buds-loop-watch-fit-spotlight-details-launch">launched</a> the Motorola Buds Loop, Watch Fit, which are expected to drop in stores this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is officially removing Assistant Driving Mode from Android as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> transition. The feature has undergone numerous changes since its introduction in 2019, most recently losing the app dashboard that was a crucial part of the Driving Mode experience. Now, it's no longer available as part of the Google Maps app for Android, the company told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/25/google-assistant-driving-mode-maps/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>As of February 2024, the app launcher that featured large, easy-to-touch icons while driving was removed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/assistant-driving-mode-change-coming-soon">most recent version of Assistant Driving Mode</a> only offered a media playback bar and the a control button. It was mostly used by Android users that didn't have a car with Android Auto functionality, since Driving Mode offered similar utility at one point.</p><p>In fact, Assistant Driving Mode was initially seen as a replacement and alternative to Android Auto for Phone Screens, was killed in 2021.</p><p>The Assistant Driving Mode app launcher was one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-to-lose-some-set-of-features">many Google Assistant feature removals announced in January 2024</a>. "Using app launcher in Google Assistant driving mode on Google Maps to read and send messages, make calls, and control media," the company explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?visit_id=638405824903310620-1049243567&p=assistant_is_changing&rd=1">support document</a> at the time. "You can still use voice control on Google Maps the same way."</p>

<p>Over a year later, not even the Assistant Driving Mode's playback controls or voice control button are available as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>. This is an intentional removal that is part of the Gemini transition, per the company. At this point, it means Assistant Driving Mode in Maps is gone for good.</p><p>The move is part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">larger transition from Google Assistant to Gemini</a> that was announced officially in March 2025. It's currently underway, and will see most mobile devices ditch Assistant in favor of Gemini in the near future.</p>

The company will offer discounts to affected users that want to upgrade to the 4th-generation Nest Learning Thermostat, it said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Support-changes-to-our-earliest-generation-Nest-Learning-Thermostats/ba-p/713068" target="_blank">community post</a> dated April 25, 2025.</p><p>The decision, which will take effect October 25, 2025, means that the 1st-gen and 2nd-gen Nest Learning Thermostat models will no longer receive software updates or support remote control via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. The hardware will still work as a traditional thermostat, but smart features are going away this fall.</p><p>"We're incredibly excited about the future of Nest and the innovative experiences we're building for your smart home," the company explained. "To fully invest in these advancements and bring you the most cutting-edge features on our latest generation of Nest thermostats, we will be transitioning away from supporting three of our oldest devices, each over a decade old."</p>

<p>"All other Nest thermostat models are unaffected and will continue to receive security updates," Google continues. "Later this year you also will be able to create and adjust schedules for these devices in the Google Home app for the first time."</p><p>Google aims to "ease the transition" by offering U.S. customers $130 off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">new 4th-generation Nest Learning Thermostat</a>, bringing the cost down to $149.99 (MSRP $279.99). In Canada, customers get $160 off the new thermostat, which would then cost $219.99 (MSRP $379.99 CAD).</p>

<p>European customers can't buy a new Nest Thermostat, but Google is offering 50% off a third-party thermostat with Google Home Support.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-google-no-longer-selling-nest-learning-thermostats-in-europe-2">Why is Google no longer selling Nest Learning Thermostats in Europe?</h2>
<p>As part of the announcement, Google said it will no longer sell new Nest Learning Thermostat models in Europe. The third-generation Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Thermostat E will both continue to be sold in Europe while supplies last. After that, it'll be up to third-party Google Home partners to fill the gap.</p><p>"Heating systems in Europe are unique and have a variety of hardware and software requirements that make it challenging to build for the diverse set of homes," Google said. "Therefore moving forward we’ll no longer launch new Nest thermostats in Europe."</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I was a Motorola fanboy. This was back in the day when basically everyone was, as it was in the company's hayday. We had the Moto X and Moto Maker, the Motorola-made Nexus 6 was ahead of its time, at least in screen size, and then all of the fun just went away. For me, Motorola had a brief resurgence with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-z">Moto Z</a> devices, even if the idea of magnetic accessories didn't catch on until Apple did it with MagSafe.</p><p>But then, Motorola just faded into obscurity, focusing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">sub-$300 market</a>, and for the most part, doing a good job at it. By then, Motorola had been purchased by Google, before being stripped down and sold for parts to Lenovo. Since then, I've never even had so much of a peripheral desire to use a Moto phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wsZEcLuivUBdgGL2DEvm4U" name="nexus-6-black-and-white" alt="Motorola Nexus 6 in Black and White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wsZEcLuivUBdgGL2DEvm4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And then the company released its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-razr-review">first foldable phone</a>, complete with the ability to make the dial pad look like the old-school RAZR that I used in high school. The needle moved a bit, but after using a couple of clamshell foldables, I decided that the book-style was my preferred design.</p><p>However, given just how long it's been since I've used a Motorola phone, I have to admit that I'm intrigued by what the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra</a> brings to the table. Over the past couple of years, Motorola has beaten Samsung to the punch when it comes to offering a bit of innovation in the space. Mostly, when it comes to the cover screen, it continued to get bigger and simultaneously more useful.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-05" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4SKK4pMU3d5DEjsMzpqELe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing though, it's still just a regular sized phone that folds in half. There's no appeal in that for me, especially since I rarely even leave my house, let alone travel outside the confines of my state. So the idea of being ultra portable and pocketable is lost on me from the get-go.</p><p>Instead, I wish Motorola would have debuted its first book-style foldable phone. The Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold are both great in their own rights, and the OnePlus Open still holds up for most tasks. But, the Oppo Find N5 isn't being rebranded, and we don't know when the next OnePlus foldable will even arrive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8yVVWui3NnjnCSU96atTn4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola is so far removed from my mind that it wasn't until now that I thought about where it could release a Galaxy Z Fold competitor. That's with folks like Android Central Managing Editor and Resident Moto Nerd, Derrek Lee, heaping praise on Motorola whenever they can.</p><p>So there are a few reasons why I think Motorola could excel, with the first being the experience it already has. Foldable phones aren't for everyone, and at the same time, they aren't for every company. However, Moto has been in the game since it joined the ranks with Huawei and Samsung back in 2019, longer than Google and OnePlus.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-cover-screen-1" alt="Instagram on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3y2gqgQXwrfKbCuJyG3Xqn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3807" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's important, as Motorola has the experience of dealing with varying screen sizes and accounting for foldable states. Granted, they've been confined to the height and width of traditional candy bar phones, but still, that should count for something.</p><p>Another reason why I think a Moto book-style foldable would be neat is that until the Razr Ultra, the company has pretty much managed to stay under the $1,000 price point. The Ultra throws that notion out the window, with its $1,299 price tag, coming in slightly higher than the Z Flip 6 with the same amount of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-cover-screen" alt="YouTube Music on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dmdDb4YECXHeboj5jPDjc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, with that, you're getting a larger cover screen, a better and less finicky experience on said cover screen, and flagship specs. That includes the Snapdragon 8 Elite, paired with 16GB of RAM and either 512GB or 1TB of storage.</p><p>Motorola even beats out Samsung in the camera department, relying on dual 50MP sensors, compared to the 50MP + 12MP combination of the Flip. So if you ask me, the Razr Ultra should take the crown for best clamshell foldable, unless Samsung manages to pull a rabbit out of its hat with the Z Flip 7.</p><p>I'd even venture so far as to say that I'm intrigued to the point that I'm actually considering picking one up. For one, it's probably time that I pay more attention to what Motorola is doing, as I can't even remember the last Moto phone that I used. But I'm also interested in trying out the form factor again, seeing as its been a couple of years since I last used a flip phone.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Motorola told us all about the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">2025 Razr</a> phones, and now we can stop guessing what will be there and what won't. The biggest twist was a new expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024">Ultra model</a> while maybe the real news is the lack of significant changes from 2024 to 2025 on the "regular" Razr and the Razr Plus.</p><p>First off, I do not hate this. Not one tiny bit. When you make a product that you're confident in and sell it at a price you think is fair, there shouldn't be a lot to change year in and year out. A 2025 Razr is simply a 2024 Razr with newer, easier-to-obtain components inside and a vehicle for a new software platform and business partnership.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything can stay the same. You get a new MediaTek processor and camera parts, neither of which will live up to any promises or make any difference in day-to-day use because they never do, and the big thing for the software is a partnership with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity AI</a> to make it able to be the default agent on your phone.</p><p>Nothing to sneeze at for sure, but nothing worth rushing out to upgrade if you have last year's model. The saving grace is the price; it's a new foldable that should work well under $700. Again, just like last year's model.</p>

<p>Don't buy one for $699 unless you just gotta have it today, though. I think the secret weapon feature is going to stay the same — that price was meant to change and there is either plenty of profit margin in this one or it's being used as a loss leader. I predict you'll soon be able to buy it for a song and dance.</p><p>That's what happened last year. The Razr is a good buy at $699 compared to the price of other phones. It's an even better buy at $599 or $499, but it's a crazy bargain at $299. And a $299 Moto Razr, even an unlocked model, was not hard to find.</p>
<p>I have no plans to run out and get a new phone because that's something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-havent-switched-phones-for-almost-a-year-and-i-love-it">I hate doing</a> and I don't need one right now. If I were looking for one, the Razr is the one I would be looking at. Not only because it's what I know and like using every day, but because it's a great value.</p><p>When people say Moto messed up by not making the 2025 Razr different from last year, I disagree and think the company did just what it should have done: same great phone, same great price, and hopefully, the same deals to come.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out its newest tile redesign in Meet, which we've heard previously.</li><li>The redesign will sample colors from a user's profile picture when their camera is not in use, creating a classier, modern take on the old bland gray background.</li><li>This "color-sampling" feature was highlighted during Google Meet's large update announcement in late March alongside "Dynamic Layouts."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to have a slight design revamp rolling out for its video calling experience on desktop.</p><p>The redesign in Meet was spotted for its tiles by Android Central's Editor-in-Chief (EIC), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/shruti-shekar">Shruti Shekar</a>, earlier today (Apr. 25). According to her discovery, this particular tile revamp only concerns users who aren't using their camera. Previously, this would default your tile to a gray background with your circular profile icon in its center.</p><p>However, today's update brings a little more pizazz.</p><p>We've observed a more appealing, vibrant coloring behind our profile icons when in a Meet call. While the coloring may seem random, it's actually taking colors from our Google account pictures to produce a classier appearance. For our EIC, it sampled the brown brick coloring of her background.</p><p>Android Central's News Editor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/nandika-ravi">Nandika Ravi</a>, had a bluish coloring in her portrait's background sampled and implanted onto the tile. Another interesting change is that the user's profile icon is taken and blown up in the background of the colored tile. It's then blurred to complete the more modern take on an otherwise bland gray history.</p><p>You can take a look at Meet's before and after photos. While we've noticed this today, our EIC states the change was only seen on her Mac laptop. Perhaps this is rolling out for iOS desktops to start before Windows PCs receive it — keep your eyes peeled.</p>

<p>Google's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">slowly rolling out updates</a> for Meet that improve the experience significantly. In August 2024, the company brought upgraded on-the-go calling for users who are, for example, driving. The feature arrived for Android and iOS devices, bringing enlarged buttons and an audio-only mode to ensure you're not distracted (but still paying attention).</p><p>On a more fun side, Meet gained "stacked" effects. Users can add unique "accessories" to their video stream during a call, like characters, costumes, and more.</p><p>Regarding the new tiles in Meet, that was wrapped in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-now-uses-ai-to-show-more-faces-in-dynamic-layouts">another large update</a> from late March. In its Workspace post, Google said the "visual upgrade" would bring "color-sampled tile theming for users with their cameras off." We're not seeing to what extent this color sampling function will go for users and their diverse profile pictures. Additionally, the update leaned heavily on AI with "Dynamic Layouts."</p><p>These layouts will crop out useless background space in your video stream to prioritize your face and the faces of others.</p>

The company's CEO and Co-Founder, Adrian Li Mow Ching, stated, "Clicks for Razr has quickly become the most popular physical keyboard for Android smartphones."</p><p>As such, the post says the newly announced physical keyboard attachment for the Razr Ultra 2025 "builds on the hype" the company experienced when it launched the Razr/Razr Plus 2024 version.</p><p>Users interested will be able to pre-order the Clicks keyboard and case combination. You can quickly slot the Razr Ultra into the case and use its keyboard on its cover display, or open it and use it in a more practical scenario. Clicks says its designed its back-lit keys are designed to be "ergonomic" and "contoured," meaning consumers should have a comfortable typing experience.</p><p>Moreover, as if it were a full-fledged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-external-keyboards-android-tablets">keyboard for a tablet</a>, Clicks says there are shortcuts available to launch apps and more without tapping your display.</p>

<p>The Clicks keyboard for the Razr Ultra 2025 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discover.clicks.tech/products/clicks-keyboard-for-motorola-razr-2025">available for pre-orders</a> beginning today (Apr. 25). Consumers will find the product in Onyx, which the post states is an "off-black," for $139. Keep in mind that Android Central has tried accessing the page, but it doesn't appear to be working properly at the time of writing. However, the case/keyboard combo isn't prepared to ship until <em>after </em>May 31.</p><p>You might benefit from checking again later on to see if it's up and running.</p><p>If you remember BlackBerry, the Clicks keyboard for the Moto Razr <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/the-clicks-keyboard-for-my-motorola-razr-can-turn-my-phone-into-what-ive-been-missing">kind of brought that back</a>. The product gives users a new (old?) way to utilize their phones, especially if they miss the feeling of a physical keyboard on a mobile device. Moreover, Clicks' keyboard lets Razr and Razr Plus 2024 users unlock a brand new experience with their cover displays.</p><p>Adrian Li Mow Ching added the case and the phone work together to create a "pocketable productivity pairing" for consumers.</p><p>Last year's Razrs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">weren't the only ones</a> Clicks brought into the physical keypad fold. The company looped in the Google Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, and the Galaxy S25.</p>

<ul><li>CMF by Nothing has continued to tease its upcoming Phone 2 Pro; however, its latest post might allude to a unique camera add-on.</li><li>The sub-brand posted what appears to be a camera lens attachment, but offers no additional information, leaving only speculation.</li><li>CMF by Nothing's latest teasers showed off the Phone 2 Pro in two-toned orange and white colors, as well as confirmation of "Essential Spaces."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>We're on the cusp of the next CMF by Nothing reveal, but the company just teased something that might shake up your next trip.</p><p>The sub-brand has been teasing its upcoming products all week on X, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1915707413123993949">its latest one</a> seemingly teasing a camera addition. CMF by Nothing's post is short, only offering the tagline: "3 days until we announce..." What's most important is the image, which shows what we, and many others on X, believe to be a camera lens attachment.</p><p>The company hasn't clearly stated what this is and, if it is a lens attachment, what its specifications could be. CMF by Nothing has been hyping up its camera, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1913155928951505011">a previous teaser</a> said, "Built for light, depth, and detail. Redesigned from the inside out." This teaser regarded the CMF Phone 2 Pro.</p><p>There's a chance this lens attachment (should it be true) will help consumers take more detailed shots with enhanced zoom, aperture, and other additions.</p><p>The CMF by Nothing Phone 2 Pro is slated to debut on April 28.</p>

<p>CMF <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-its-cmf-phone-2-pro-days-before-launch">posted a clearer look</a> at its Phone 2 Pro earlier this week. The short clip showed off the device in two colors: orange and white. The device looks to sport a two-tone design, with the top half adopting a brighter, vibrant look. The next CMF Phone keeps its screws and other "modularity" aspects, which was confirmed in a recently highlighted post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AkisEvangelidis/status/1915706006610288746">Akis Evangelidis</a>.</p><p>Another key aspect of the CMF Phone 2 Pro is its <em>triple </em>camera array. Right now, rumors allege the device's array will contain a 50MP 1/1.57-inch primary lens, a 50MP 2x telephoto camera, and an 8MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The device is also expected to debut with Nothing's new suite of AI features under its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a>" moniker. This collection of AI software debuted first on the Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Phone 3a and 3a Pro, </a>giving users tools to capture on-screen content and store it away for later. The AI contains its own organizational tools, so users can easily find what they've taken previously.</p><p>The sub-brand also released its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothings-cmf-buds-2-are-now-available-as-it-teases-the-cmf-phone-2-pro">CMF Buds 2</a> in mid-April, a few weeks ahead of its next major phone launch.</p>

<p>So far, most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-google-pixel-9a-deals-of-the-month">Google Pixel 9a promos</a> have been requiring things like trade-ins and new wireless lines to receive the savings, so it's nice to see a straightforward phone deal come down the pipeline. </p><p>No matter which offer you choose, however, you'll be getting a midrange beauty with a vibrant 6.3-inch pOLED display, the super-efficient Tensor G4 chipset, and a larger battery than the more-expensive Google Pixel 9. Google will also hook you up with seven years of OS/security upgrades and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> straight out of the box. </p><p>If you can afford it, the base model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> is obviously the better device, but for folks who are looking for modern Pixel technology in a budget phone package, this Best Buy deal presents a unique opportunity.</p>

<p>Meta, on Thursday (April 24), laid off an unknown number of employees from its Reality Labs division, which includes employees working in Oculus studios, who are responsible for creating mixed reality wearables as well as games for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/homeworld-vast-reaches-arrives-on-meta-quest">Meta’s Quest VR </a>headsets.</p><p>In an email to Android Central, Meta spokesperson said, “Some teams within Oculus Studios are undergoing shifts in structure and roles that have impacted team size,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>These cuts are meant to help the Oculus studios work more efficiently on delivering mixed reality experiences, Meta added.</p>

<p>Reuters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/meta-cuts-jobs-its-reality-labs-division-2025-04-24/">noted</a> that employees working on Supernatural, a VR fitness game, are among those impacted in the latest round of cuts. This was confirmed by Meta's spokesperson as well.</p><p>They further added that, despite these cuts, "We remain committed to investing in mixed reality experiences, including fitness and games, and our drive to deliver the best experiences possible for the Quest and Supernatural communities remains unchanged."</p><p>As of December last year, the company's headcount <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investor.atmeta.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2025/Meta-Reports-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-2024-Results/default.aspx">grew</a> by 10%, to 74,067. This comes after Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, said that he would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/meta-reports-upbeat-quarterly-revenue-2025-01-29/">cut</a> 5% of Meta's lowest-performing employees and warned them that more cuts were slated for this year.</p>

<p>During Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Q4 earnings call </a>in January,  the company stated that Reality Labs experienced a record-breaking revenue in 2024. This was driven by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s">Meta Quest 3S</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> sales, with Zuckerberg commenting that "the number of people using Quest and Horizon is steadily growing." He further described 2025 as a "pivotal year for the metaverse" and teased the company launching more "visually stunning content" soon.</p><p>However, it is important to note that despite its great overall performance, the Reality Labs division operated at a loss in Q4, with operating expenses totaling nearly $5 billion.</p><p>In other news, Meta is slated to announce its Q1 earnings for this year on April 30, which could give us more insight as to what Reality Labs' revenue looks like for this quarter.</p>

But I also found new settings to change based on my preferences, plus some tips from Google's reviewer guide on new features to test.</p><p>From basic settings to Gemini tricks, these are the first nine things to do with your Google Pixel 9a after unboxing it!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-your-display-settings"><span>Update your display settings</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="RKXEX5735XkJttz5XJ2hMh" name="Google-Pixel-9a-settings" alt="The display size settings menu on the Google Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RKXEX5735XkJttz5XJ2hMh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the first things I did with my Pixel 9a was go to <strong>Settings > Display & touch</strong>, lengthen the <strong>screen timeout</strong> from the default 30 seconds to two minutes, and toggle the <strong>smooth display</strong> option to unlock 120Hz for certain apps. The Pixel 9a has the battery life to handle the extra power draw for better visuals, and I like that I can set my phone down for a minute and then pick right back up without a login delay.</p><p>Many of my colleagues dislike adaptive brightness on any phone, preferring to adjust it themselves in the Quick Settings. If you agree, you can <strong>untoggle Adaptive brightness</strong> in this same Display & touch menu. Then you can <strong>swipe down twice</strong> from the home screen to find the brightness slider anytime.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="frtqi8nGB6g6fx2ofAJ5b7" name="pixel-9a-display-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to lengthen the screen timeout or turn on the Dark or Night Light themes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/frtqi8nGB6g6fx2ofAJ5b7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, you can choose between the popular <strong>Dark theme</strong> or the <strong>Night Light</strong> setting with an amber hue that prevents blue light. In either case, if you only want to use it at night, tap the text to find a <strong>Schedule</strong> option for bedtime, sunset to sunrise, or a custom time. You can also adjust the amber intensity of Night Light.</p><p>Another way to prevent eye strain is with the <strong>Display size and text</strong> settings under Appearance; here, you can make the UI font bigger, make the font <strong>bold</strong> or <strong>high contrast</strong>, or make <em>everything</em> bigger like icons.</p><p>Finally, open the <strong>Lock screen</strong> settings and toggle "Always show time and info" for a basic always-on display (AOD) that also includes the weather, notification icons, and battery percentage.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QZ53m5TwsxP9UhvA9JaFcg" name="Google-Pixel-9a-charging-optimization-settings" alt="The Charging optimization settings menu on the Google Pixel 9a held next to a charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QZ53m5TwsxP9UhvA9JaFcg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By default, the Pixel 9a uses charging optimization, studying your sleep and charging patterns so that it hits 100% around the time you usually wake up. This prolongs your battery life but can also lead to moments where it's not fully charged if you wake up early.</p><p>In the Settings app, tap <strong>Battery > Charging optimization</strong> to toggle off Adaptive Charging, if you prefer. Then you can go into <strong>Battery Saver</strong> options and toggle off <strong>Use Adaptive battery</strong>, which can "reduce performance and delay notifications" based on your usage habits to "extend battery life." Your 9a will be faster, but may need a battery replacement down the line.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iucUdxH5auGWNzNZEJwBd7" name="Google-Pixel-9a-charging-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to turn on or off Charging optimization, schedule Battery Saver mode, and turn off Adaptive Battery mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iucUdxH5auGWNzNZEJwBd7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Conversely, you can permanently <strong>Limit charging to 80%</strong> in the optimization menu. Because the Pixel 9a has enough battery to last a full day with plenty left over, this option ensures the best possible battery longevity, but could lead to a shortage if you spend all day taking photos or gaming.</p><p>If you're trying to extend your Pixel 9a to two-day use, one thing to consider is tapping <strong>Battery > Battery Saver > Schedule</strong> and increasing the percentage where it toggles on to, say, 30% or 40%.</p>

<p>If you don't already have your <strong>Bedtime routine settings</strong> ported from your last Pixel, go to <strong>Settings > Digital Wellbeing > Bedtime mode</strong> and toggle open <strong>Bedtime routine</strong> to change which hours and days it toggles.</p><p>You can also make it so Bedtime mode auto-activates when you charge your Pixel 9a or turns off when your first alarm goes off. And under <strong>Customize > Screen options</strong>, you can trigger specific Bedtime changes like turning off AOD or dimming the wallpaper at night.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WUguprPDHcddpJ7J5WLMb7" name="Google-Pixel-9a-bedtime-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing the Settings for Bedtime Mode, Focus Mode, and App Limits." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WUguprPDHcddpJ7J5WLMb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But Bedtime isn't the only mode you should consider if you have a problem with endless doomscrolling or Instagram/TikTok feeds at night. Tap <strong>App limits</strong> to set a hard time limit to any specific app or turn on <strong>Screen time reminders</strong> for "gentle reminders when you're spending a long time in an app."</p><p>You may also want to use <strong>Focus mode</strong> to limit distracting notifications during work hours. First, choose "distracting apps" with notifications you'd like to hide, then tap <strong>set a schedule</strong> to choose when you'd like to filter them out. Alternatively, a Focus mode toggle should appear in the Quick Settings if you want to trigger it manually.</p><p>My personal favorite? <strong>Flip to Shhh</strong>, which toggles on Do Not Disturb if you put your phone face-down on a flat surface, such as during a meeting; toggle it on if that sounds useful!</p>

<p>Your Pixel 9a comes with a few free Google goodies. You only get <strong>three months of YouTube Premium</strong> if you haven't gotten a free trial before, but even returning customers will get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium</strong> so long as you're not currently subscribed; simply open the Fitbit app to accept the offer, and set a reminder to cancel in six months if you don't end up liking it.</p><p>Unfortunately, only the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro get free trials of Google One or Google One AI Premium, respectively. But at least the Pixel 9a gets free access to the <strong>VPN by Google</strong>, a former Google One perk that's now Pixel-exclusive. This lets you have secure mobile browsing on both public and private networks, even if it's not as robust as our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">favorite (paid) VPNs</a>.</p><p>To turn on the VPN, go to <strong>Settings > Network & Internet > VPN by Google</strong> and tap the <strong>Allow</strong> option at the bottom. You can then choose to <strong>Pause VPN on selected networks</strong> (such as your personal network) since it may use more data than normal browsing. You can also toggle the VPN on and off in the Quick Settings menu by swiping down from the Home screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-scam-detection-screening"><span>Scam detection & screening</span></h2>
<p>The Google Phone app has a ton of AI-backed smarts that you'll want to turn on straight away. Open the app, tap the <strong>top-right ellipsis</strong>, then <strong>Settings</strong>. Caller ID & spam should be on by default — though check it to be sure — while other useful tricks need to be toggled on.</p><p>Spam calls are identified, but if you want to fully screen them, tap <strong>Call Screen</strong> and toggle <strong>Automatically screen calls</strong> to filter first-time callers, Spam numbers, and possibly faked numbers. A pop-up like "Screening unknown number" will appear, which you can tap to see a real-time transcript of Assistant speaking to the (alleged) person. If Assistant thinks the person is real, they'll send the call over to you.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-emergency-features"><span>Set up emergency features</span></h2>
<p>If you're like me, you'll procrastinate on setting up emergency Pixel 9a features until you "have time" and then never do it. Rip off the band-aid and spend the next five minutes making sure these features are all set up!</p><p>In <strong>Settings > Safety & emergency</strong>, turn on Emergency SOS so that either pressing the Power button five times pulls up the emergency menu, so it'll auto-call <strong>911</strong> and (if you toggle these features) <strong>share info with emergency contacts</strong> and <strong>record emergency video</strong> of whatever's happening.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WbapdbhebPFhb8JL2K98Nd" name="google-pixel-9a-emergency-settings-screenshots" alt="Google Pixel 9a screenshots showing how to turn on Emergency SOS and Emergency Sharing, as well as add your Medical information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WbapdbhebPFhb8JL2K98Nd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, add your <strong>Medical information</strong> like your blood type, allergies, medication, medical notes, and whether you're an organ donor to be shared with emergency responders. Then go ahead and <strong>add emergency contacts</strong> like family or roommates that you'd like notified in these moments.</p><p><strong>Car crash detection</strong> may be enabled by default, but tap it to toggle on <strong>Emergency Sharing</strong> of your location and status to your contacts. And while you're in this menu, you can toggle <strong>Silence notifications while driving</strong>, which uses your device's "motion and Bluetooth connections to figure out when you're in a moving vehicle" — though this won't work if you regularly take a bus or subway.</p>

<p>If you haven't used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a> yet, you're missing out. On any photo, tap <strong>Edit</strong>, then the <strong>rainbow icon</strong> in the bottom-left. You can tap an object or person to resize it or move it around the frame; personally, I like to tap the bottom-middle <strong>magic wand icon</strong> that pulls up options like Auto reframing, reimagined backgrounds, stylized filters, alternative water layers, shifted Portrait blurring, and other contextually relevant changes.</p><p>Of course, Magic Editor is old news for Pixel 8a users, as is Magic Eraser, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser">Audio Magic Eraser</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Best Take</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-photo-unblur-pixel">Photo Unblur</a>, and other AI tools; those linked guides will help if you're new to Pixels.</p><p>But in terms of what's new to the Pixel A-series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9"><strong>Add Me</strong></a> is a useful trick that lets everyone into a group photo, including the one taking it.

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-camera-macro-focus" alt="The Google Pixel 9a camera viewfinder, with a close-up of a gnome thanks to the Macro Focus mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Macro Focus</strong> is even easier to use! If you get your 9a close enough (within 5cm or 2 inches), a flower icon will appear in the top-right corner and the viewfinder should auto-adjust to put the entire subject into clear focus. There's no extra settings required.</p><p>The third new feature is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel"><strong>Astrophotography mode</strong></a>, with which you set your Pixel 9a up somewhere stable — ideally with a tripod — and take a drawn-out shot of the night sky. To use it, swipe to the <strong>Night Sight</strong> option next to Photo, tap the <strong>moon icon</strong> in the bottom-right, and then push the slider that appears from Auto to <strong>Astro</strong>. Once your phone is stable, tap the <strong>5-second countdown button</strong> and the 9a will take a four-minute shot of your subject!</p>

<p>I tend to use the default wallpaper on my phones for years, something that my partner frequently mocks me for. If you want to let your personality fly, <strong>tap and hold</strong> any empty space on the home screen, then tap <strong>Wallpaper & style > More wallpapers</strong>.</p><p>Google has hundreds of curated wallpapers available in categories like Motif, Living Universe, Landscapes, and some European football teams for some reason. To get more personal, tap <strong>My photos</strong> and choose a favorite family pic or some cool art you downloaded from online. Or, you can try your luck with the <strong>AI wallpaper prompt</strong>, choose a theme like "Painting" or "Imaginary," and then change the prompt words until you find something less creepy than the teddy bear watercolor Google came up with.</p><p>As a side note, if you're a fan of AI art prompts for inspiration, be sure to install the <strong>Pixel Studio app</strong> that creates general-purpose art, not just wallpapers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E7PKYutSdDgzmCNGxbLWrg" name="Google-Pixel-9a-widgets" alt="Gmail, Chrome, and Photos widgets on the Google Pixel 9a sitting on a brick surface." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E7PKYutSdDgzmCNGxbLWrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once you've finished sprucing up your home and lock screen wallpaper, I highly recommend adding <strong>widgets</strong> by (again) tapping and holding the home screen and tapping that menu option.</p><p>I mostly use the vertical app drawer to find apps I want, so the secondary home screens full of apps are wasted space for me! So I instead fill that space with widgets that let me preview the information I'm most likely to need, like my upcoming Google Calendar reminder, today's weather, music playback controls, or most recent Gmail emails.</p><p>Widgets can also be sources of fun, like the "Your memories" box from Google Photos, the Chrome Dino game, or a Strava widget showing my weekly mileage. To add them, simply tap and hold any widget and then drag them onto your home screen!</p>

<p>Gemini has become the default assistant for Android.

Either way, this lets you ask Gemini about what's on your screen, like summarizing a YouTube video or...this article, if you wanted!</p><p>Otherwise, you'll get the best Gemini responses by opening the Gemini app. There, you can type out questions or tap the <strong>Gemini Live icon</strong> in the bottom-right for an in-depth conversation that remembers past questions for context. You can even upload images and ask Gemini about them, or use your Pixel 9a camera to ask for information about the world around you.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this Google Pixel 9a beginner's guide has given you the tips and tricks necessary to take full advantage of your new phone!</p><p>My last bit of advice is something that applies to most new phone purchases, but especially the Pixel 9a: Make sure you buy a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">Pixel 9a case</a> and/ or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">Pixel 9a screen protector</a>! The 9a isn't as wide as some flagship phones, and its thick sides aren't hard to grip, but all it takes is one drop to ruin that camera sensor or crack through the outdated Gorilla Glass 3 display protection.</p><p>Otherwise, if you're curious how else the Pixel 9a compares to its predecessor, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">Pixel 9a vs. 8a vs. 7a camera review</a> or our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a vs. 8a feature guide</a>!</p>

This plays on Motorola's strengths in the market and ushers in a new chance for the company to break into the premium segment once again, something it hasn't tried since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr 2025 family</a> continues to improve the specs, ingress protection, durability, and even offers more variety than ever before. Because of this, we have some ideas of what to expect from Motorola in 2026 when it launches the inevitable Motorola Razr 2026 line.</p><p>Here, we'll be compiling all the rumors, leaks, and what we expect to see from Motorola's successful flippable foldables in the coming year.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-motorola-razr-2026-what-s-likely-to-be-the-same"><span>Motorola Razr 2026: What's likely to be the same</span></h3>

<p>Unless the Motorola Razr Ultra 2026 is a complete failure, we fully expect Motorola to continue offering multiple models at different price points. Motorola has shied away from making a full-on premium phone for the U.S. market for a few years now, and it's good to see them return with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6">Razr 2025 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Motorola has also been expanding its repertoire of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-vegan-leather-phones">alternative materials on phones</a>, particularly on the Razr line, and we fully expect to see that make a comeback in 2026. If Motorola can offer vegan leather on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">phones that are less than $200</a>, there's no reason to expect the company to return to breakable glass on its foldable line.</p><p>We also don't expect Motorola to stray from the "flip" form factor any time soon. While Motorola continually experiments with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-rizr-rollable-phone-updated-fingerprint-patent">different smartphone form factors</a>, it's pretty clear it thinks that phones are best in a vertical form factor rather than expanding to look like a tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2025" alt="Motorola Razr Plus 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cyKcMLrmUsrF8EZyRdJ5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there should be a chip upgrade in next year's Motorola Razr Plus 2026, don't expect the company to bring it up to "proper" flagship levels like it did with the Ultra. If there's any kind of upgrade in the middle model, we expect Motorola to pull a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> and use the previous year's flagship processor as a means of keeping the price low.</p><p>Motorola also already offers significantly faster charging than its biggest rival, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip, which means we expect 68W Motorola TurboPower to continue to be offered.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This year, Motorola isn't just using specs to differentiate the Ultra from the rest of the Razr 2025 lineup. It's also packing the Ultra with more AI features than the other two models, but I don't think that's going to be the case in 2026. If Nothing's budget CMF Phone 2 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-shows-off-its-cmf-phone-2-pro-days-before-launch">can have a dedicated AI key</a>, so can the more budget-friendly Razr 2026 phones.</p><p>Likewise, we expect some of the spec upgrades on the Ultra to trickle down to the rest of the line. This could include different materials, like wood or proper leather, as well as processor upgrades, bigger batteries, and even more enhancements to the IP dust and resistance ratings.</p><p>We're also expecting some bigger spec bumps for the Razr Plus 2026 versus what we saw on the 2025 model. As Derrek Lee said in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 hands-on</a>, "Aside from the new hinge, IP48 certification, and Pantone-validated display and cameras, the core specs (of the Razr Plus 2025) are largely the same as those of the Razr Plus 2024." In other words, there's little reason to upgrade if you've got a Razr Plus 2024, but that should change in 2026.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-20" alt="Holding the Razr Ultra 2025 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gmhSgVXRgbnH96842LxVUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, we're hoping the Razr Ultra 2026 feels just one more "ultra" feature than this year's: a third camera on the back. Motorola already out-specced Samsung in this department, offering the first 50MP triple-camera system on a flip phone, but we think the company can push it a little further and include a 50MP triple-camera system <em>on the back</em>.</p><p>That would give the Ultra the best cameras from the entire rest of the lineup, as the Ultra features a standard and <em>ultrawide </em>lens, while the Razr Plus features a standard and <em>telephoto</em> lens. Having both an ultrawide and a telephoto lens would truly make the Razr Ultra 2026 feel like a massive upgrade.</p><p>And if we're talking wishlist items, any additional customization is always welcome. Motorola set the bar for customization over a decade ago <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-decade-moto-x">with the Moto X</a> and, given the climate in the U.S. surrounding manufacturing, it would be incredible to see Motorola once again offer the Moto Maker tool so people can fully customize their Razrs in the future.</p>

<p>Last year, Motorola released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr 2024 line</a> in June, while this year's line bumped that up to May 15. We saw something similar happen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9</a>, but we don't expect Motorola to continue to move it up every single year.</p><p>The company has often released phones in the April/May timeline, and with the continuing shift in the company's flagship release strategy, it's no surprise seeing the successful Razr take over the Edge's release window. That being said, we expect a Razr 2026 announcement in April 2026 unless something big changes.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Remember a few weeks ago, when I said that I was worried about the slow and painful demise of ChromeOS? Yeah, let's just pretend that never happened. Since then, we've seen new Chromebooks from both Acer and ASUS, and there's more on the way.</p><p>Robby over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromeunboxed.com/finally-snapdragon-x-plus-chromebooks-are-on-the-way/">ChromeUnboxed</a> is a master when it comes to digging through the Chromium Repositories. The latest discovery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromiumos/platform/depthcharge/+/6483287">was a commit</a> that brings "initial support for Qualcomm X1P42100 SoC," which is just the codename for the Snapdragon X Plus chip.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4110px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TZ2dfXBuPkxHWjxUK9hZZN" name="chromeos-snapdragon-x-plus-its-happening-meme" alt=""It's Happening" meme from 'The Office' using the Chrome and Snapdragon X Plus logos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TZ2dfXBuPkxHWjxUK9hZZN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4110" height="2312" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: NBCUniversal | Google | Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before I get too ahead of myself, this isn't confirmation that such a Chromebook will ever actually see the light of day. We've seen it countless times where a device almost makes it to the finish line, only to fall just short and basically disappear. However, I'm really (and I mean REALLY) hoping that isn't the case here.</p><p>The commit message doesn't really say anything else, so there's no indication of what a ChromeOS Snapdragon X Plus device looks like. All we really know and care about, for the moment, is that the work and development are underway.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.34%;"><img id="9bAJdaYSeb8PNUHMrZZvRN" name="snapdragon-x-plus-chromium-gerrit-commit-message" alt="Commit message of Google beginning support development for Snapdragon X Plus SoC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bAJdaYSeb8PNUHMrZZvRN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1160" height="468" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chromium Gerrit)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not like this is the first time we're seeing a new ARM chip make its way to the platform. Recently, MediaTek announced its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/mediatek-is-doing-what-qualcomm-shouldve-done">Kompanio Ultra processor</a>, specifically geared towards the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a>. It offers almost 20% faster CPU performance, while consuming "up to 50% less power" than the competition. As a result, MediaTek claims it's able to offer up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge.</p><p>This is what makes the idea of an ARM-powered Chromebook so intriguing: a device that is as powerful as its Windows counterparts, with a battery that lasts all day. Plus, these ARM-powered laptops are much smaller and lighter than "traditional" offerings, making them ideal for school and travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7Kewdnugz2BGBDdun2LicX" name="lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-review-9" alt="Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid next to Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Kewdnugz2BGBDdun2LicX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Up to this point, we've been seeing MediaTek inch more and more into the Chromebook space, with a smattering of Intel, and the occasional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-zoom-calls">Snapdragon 7c</a> from Qualcomm. Notably, the Lenovo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-tablets/lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review">Chromebook Duet 11</a> is powered by the Kompanio 828 and performs admirably, but the truth is that it could be better.</p><p>Provided that Google doesn't end up changing its mind, we could eventually have the ChromeOS equivalent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Surface Pro 11</a> or Surface Laptop 7. And hey, here's an idea: Google should dust off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/its-time-for-a-pixelbook-2">Pixelbook 2</a> it shelved back in 2022, and release it with the Snapdragon X Plus at the helm.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="42gv2h4vb7yJAffMg8vdyB" name="pixelbook-go-vs-pixelbook-2.jpg" alt="Pixelbook Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42gv2h4vb7yJAffMg8vdyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the sake of not diving down that rabbit hole again, there are a couple of other factors to consider. First, we might not actually ever see a mass-produced Snapdragon X Plus Chromebook released. It's entirely possible that Google is using the X Plus as a development base, in anticipation of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/snapdragon/news/welcome-to-the-future-with-snapdragon-x-unveiled-at-ces-2025-">Snapdragon X chip</a> that Qualcomm announced at CES 2025.</p><p>Why would this be the case? Money. You can't find a Snapdragon X Plus device for less than $700, at least without scouring through the second-hand market. Google and its partners have also shied away from releasing Chromebooks that cost more than $700, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> and Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 714 hovering right around there.</p><p>So, before you get too excited, temper your expectations because I don't think we're going to see a Snapdragon X Elite Chromebook. However, utilizing the Snapdragon X Plus lets Google work out any potential kinks with the platform before it makes its way into any devices.</p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>The best camera phone</strong></em></p><p>There's no question that the Find X8 Ultra is an imaging beast. The phone has one of the best camera packages around, and the 1-inch main sensor takes truly outstanding photos and videos in challenging scenarios. The trio of 50MP auxiliary cameras are among the best you'll get on any phone, and you get plenty of versatility. The hardware is on par with the best 2025 phones, you get IP69 ingress protection, and the massive 6100mAh battery lasts at least a day and a half. My biggest issue with the Find X8 Ultra is that it's only on sale in China — OPPO still isn't launching the device globally, and that's a real shame. </p></p>

                    <p><p><em><strong>Outmatched</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is a good phone, but it just doesn't deliver much in the way of upgrades. You can pick up last year's S24 Ultra and have a phone that's nearly the same, and Samsung didn't do enough to differentiate its marquee product this year. The deficiencies are exacerbated when pitting the S25 Ultra against the Find X8 Ultra; the latter has a much better AMOLED panel with DC dimming as standard, same internals, better battery life, and better battery life. But it's around the cameras where you'll see the real difference, with the Find X8 Ultra delivering much better photos and videos in just about any situation. It's a good thing, then (at least from Samsung's point of view) that the phone isn't launching in global markets. </p></p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ADfct9XkxrELALibYe8i7F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ADfct9XkxrELALibYe8i7F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern phone design has coalesced into a sea of similar-looking flat-sided devices, and that's true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> as well. That said, the Find X8 Ultra has some differentiation thanks to the massive camera island at the back. The camera housing definitely dominates attention, and as it's centered, it doesn't lead to any wobble when using the phone on a table. <br><br>Although the device looks distinctive, it doesn't quite have the same elegance of its predecessors. I still prefer the dual-tone design of last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, and the leather back combined with the glass insert around the camera housing gave it much better flair.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jEodEMbfBb8GAunnh93F5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jEodEMbfBb8GAunnh93F5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the Find X8 Ultra looks better than the S25 Ultra, with Samsung once again using the same design aesthetic as the last four years. The phone has a flatter profile this year, but other than that, there isn't much in the way of visual changes. While Samsung pioneered ingress protection on phones, the S25 Ultra misses out on IP69; the phone has the usual IP68 dust and water resistance. The Find X8 Ultra gets both IP68 and IP69, allowing it to be immune to pressurized jets of water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X8 Ultra is thicker and heavier than the S25 Ultra but the difference isn't noticeable in daily use, and the upside is that you get a massive battery boost; Samsung still used a 5000mAh battery on its phone, while the Find X8 Ultra gets a 6100mAh unit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a better in-hand feel with the Find X8 Ultra, and there are two dedicated buttons on the device; the alert slider is now a button, and it is similar to what you get on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. The button is heavily customizable, and it allows you to toggle the flashlight, launch the camera, trigger DND, and so on. The other button is on the right, and it acts as a camera shutter. <br><br>While I didn't see much use out of the camera shutter key, the action button is quite decent. On the whole, the Find X8 Ultra has the better design and in-hand feel, and even though it doesn't look quite as distinctive, it outshines what Samsung is selling.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t36NmJtU5brhoGi2GnLGBF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t36NmJtU5brhoGi2GnLGBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 6.9-inch AMOLED panel, and it nails the basics; it has 120Hz refresh, great colors, and good brightness levels. But Samsung doesn't have any meaningful eye care protection, and the phone misses out on PWM dimming. So if you're sensitive to DC dimming, you will get headaches with extended use of the device. <br><br>Thankfully, Chinese brands are doing a much better job in this area, and the Find X8 Ultra gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels. This is a big deal, and it genuinely makes a difference in daily use. The panel also gets brighter, has outstanding colors, and has ultra-thin bezels. <br><br>Both devices get stereo sound, but I found the X8 Ultra to be louder in general use. They both do a great job with gaming as well, and there are no issues in this regard.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6PjoEAxtyVLuuBzSnbY8AF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6PjoEAxtyVLuuBzSnbY8AF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If there's one area where both devices are evenly matched, it's the hardware. Both phones use the same Qualcomm silicon, and they have outstanding potential. There isn't any lag or slowdown as such, and while overheating is an issue, it isn't a huge problem unless you're gaming. <br><br>Outside of that, there isn't much that's different. I prefer the ultrasonic reader on the Find X8 Ultra as it's demonstrably faster than the one on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and it has better accuracy.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage with the Find X8 Ultra is that it has a 6100mAh battery, delivering easily a day and a half between charges. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is decent enough as well thanks to the 5000mAh battery, but it doesn't last as long. The Find X8 Ultra uses silicon battery tech to good effect, and with 100W charging, it takes less than half as long to charge as the S25 Ultra — Samsung just doesn't measure up when it comes to battery and charging tech.</p>

<p>There's no doubt that the Find X8 Ultra has a better camera package than the Galaxy S25 Ultra — OPPO once again managed to deliver a fabulous quartet of 50MP cameras at the back. The main camera uses a 1-inch module, and it is easily one of the best you'll find on any phone today. But it's the rest of the sensors that make the device stand out so much; thanks to dual tele lenses and a good wide-angle module, the phone has better versatility than just about any other Android device I tested in 2025.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra doesn't quite measure up when it comes to the cameras. It's still got a great overall package and takes detailed shots and videos, but you don't get the same caliber of photos. Samsung needs to do a better job tuning its devices if it wants to challenge its Chinese rivals, because right now, it just isn't doing enough.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-good-lock-one-ui-7-multitasking-01" alt="The grid multitasking UI from a Good Lock module in One UI 7 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNVxrGyt4S5oKQyVt8uZB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only reason I can't recommend the Find X8 Ultra as enthusiastically is because of its availability. The device is limited to China, and as such, it doesn't include Google's mobile services out of the box. That said, the Play Store APK is included with the package, and it was straightforward to install it and access all the other Google services. <br><br>But because they're not seen as system utilities, there are inconsistencies when using the device. However, the Chinese version of ColorOS 15 has good optimization, and it holds up incredibly well in daily use. I didn't have issues with Google Pay or navigation, but it isn't quite as easy to use as the global flavor of the skin. <br><br>Samsung has the definite edge with the software; the Galaxy S25 Ultra runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> out of the box, and you get the full slate of Galaxy AI features as standard. The interface is familiar, and it runs well on the device. Best of all, you get seven Android OS updates, with the S25 Ultra carving out a lead in this regard.</p>

<p>Out of these two devices, the Find X8 Ultra is the obvious winner. It has a better design, better AMOLED panel, better battery life, and better charging tech. The cameras run rings around the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and there's no doubt that the Find X8 Ultra is the device to get if you need a fantastic overall camera package. <br><br>That's what makes its limited availability so annoying; you'll need to go the reseller route to get the device outside China, and it ends up costing the same as the S25 Ultra as a result — which isn't the case if you buy the device in China. I wouldn't suggest getting the S25 Ultra unless there's a good trade-in deal, because it just doesn't make sense to shell out anything close to retail for this device.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/happy-birthday-youtube-20/">YouTube turned 20</a> this week and celebrating its two decade milestone, the streaming platform shared some fun facts about its inception along with latest features that are being testing and coming to users soon.</p><p>What began as a 19-second video back in 2005 has now evolved into a full-blown streaming giant, with over 20 million video uploads each day. YouTube has also become a hub for people to have conversations and comment, and react to all sorts of videos, whether they like it or not. According to the streaming platform, "in 2024, YouTube users averaged over 100 million comments on videos daily. And we discovered that last year, creators received comments from an average of 10 million viewers every day.”</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cMcEB3VWKLDjtewfe6366Y" name="ask-gemini-about-video-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-1" alt="Ask Gemini about YouTube video on Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMcEB3VWKLDjtewfe6366Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, YouTube seems to be giving back to its avid users as well. In its blog post, YouTube said that in a few weeks, YouTube TV users can test out multiviews on their account. They can build their personalized multi-view window that showcases non-sports channels as well. Considering that YouTube is testing this feature out, YouTube says that it is starting "with a small group of popular channels and expanding in the coming months."</p><p>For its Premium users, the streaming platform is immediately rolling out 4x playback speed on mobile devices. This was being tested out in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-new-experimental-features-4x-speeds-and-jump-ahead">February</a> and has now finally landed.  More creators will have the ability to voice-respond to comments on their videos.</p><p>Furthermore, users can start creating their personalized radio station with the AI-powered tool called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-musics-personalized-radio-stations-are-getting-even-smarter">Ask Music</a>". You can speak or ask YouTube to create a playlist for you with "upbeat songs for a morning run," "calm jazz for studying," "80s-inspired indie," or even something more specific to your mood. Ask Music is available on iOS and Android for all YouTube Premium and YouTube Music users.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1696px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.54%;"><img id="UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg" name="YouTube-TV- redesign" alt="YouTube player redesign for TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UkU6HvbNAcuoHNACNSZicg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1696" height="942" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, the YouTube TV app is getting a full redesign this summer, the blog post added."Easier navigation, playback, quality tweaks, plus streamlined access to comments, channel info, and subscribing are heading to your screens," YouTube stated.</p><p>The company shared a quick glimpse of what the new UI would look like, featuring video from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl">@LoFiGirl. </a>The controls on the new UI are more spread out when compared to the current version. The channel, description, and subscribe buttons are on the left, the play/pause and next controls are in the center, making it more accessible and prominent. While the other controls, like settings and the like/dislike toggles, remain on the left of the screen, as seen above.</p>

<p>Alphabet, Google's parent company, announced its first-quarter earnings for this year today (April 24).  The company's revenue exceeded expectations and grew by 12% year-over-year, with consolidated revenues of $90.2 billion, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://abc.xyz/assets/34/fa/ee06f3de4338b99acffc5c229d9f/2025q1-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf">its earnings report</a>.</p><p>This number is more than what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">analysts were expecting </a>to see ($89.12 billion). If currency fluctuations aren't considered, the company's earnings actually went up by 14%.</p><p>Alphabet's dividend (regular cash payment to shareholders) saw an increase of 5%, so each share will now receive $0.21 per quarter. Google's stock also went up by 2.38% after the market closed this evening. Its net earnings increased by a large margin of 46%, coming up to $34.54 billion.</p><p>"We’re pleased with our strong Q1 results, which reflect healthy growth and momentum across the business. Underpinning this growth is our unique full-stack approach to AI," said CEO Sundar Pichai</p><p>All of the company's main products saw an overall increase in revenue. To start, the first-quarter earnings report stated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtubes-affordable-ad-free-premium-lite-officially-rolls-out">YouTube's </a>advertising brought in $8.93 billion to the company and overall advertising brought in $66.89 billion, which is up by 8.4% from the same quarter last year, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">CNBC</a>.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-labs-english-speaking-practice-ai-experiment">Google's Search</a> also saw gained $50.7 billion in revenue this quarter which is up from $46.16 billion in 2024. "Search saw continued strong growth, boosted by the engagement we’re seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-anthos-cross-platform-cloud-strategy-threat-microsoft-azure">Google Cloud</a> also took the spotlight during this quarter, with its revenue jumping by 28% to $12.3 billion. According to the report, this was driven by the company's core cloud services, AI infrastructure, and new AI-powered solutions</p><p>With respect to AI, during the earnings call, Pichai also stated that they're seeing healthy growth and momentum across all their AI-powered products. Specifically speaking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Overviews</a>, the feature provides you a quick summary of your search has seen "over 1.5 billion users per month, and we are excited by the early positive reaction to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode"> AI mode</a>."</p>

<p>During the call, Pichai was asked about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">company's ongoing trial </a>with the Justice Department. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/googles-gemini-user-numbers-revealed-court?rc=bdqvyp">revealed</a> that Gemini has 35 million daily users, while 122.58 million people use ChatGPT every day, which is a pretty big margin.</p><p>When asked what Google is doing to increase Gemini's daily metrics, Sundar said, " I think we have the best model out there now, and I think I think that's going to drive increased adoption as well."  He noted that they are innovating with AI mode, an exciting roadmap ahead with the Gemini app as well.</p><p>Lastly, Alphabet's ventures outside of Google's products that are capped under "Other Bets" saw a decrease in revenue this quarter. This segment <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/24/alphabet-googl-q1-earnings-report-2025.html">generated</a> $450 million in revenue, which is much lower than the $495 million that it made in Q1 last year.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus launched its 13T smartphone in China with a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, a 50MP primary lens, and a 50MP telephoto.</li><li>Internally, the phone rocks the Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC with loads of AI advancements for photos, notetaking, and more via ColorOS 15.</li><li>The OnePlus 13T focuses on games, too, offering 120 FPS for MOBAs and optimizations for many popular games.</li><li>The company has not listed a global launch yet for the OnePlus 13T.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is rolling out another phone for its consumers; one that's touted with a small screen, but big power.</p><p>Earlier today (Apr. 24), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/cn/13t">the OnePlus 13T launched</a> in China following the company's slew of social media teasers. The latest T-series phone takes things down a notch by offering a smaller form factor for those who love that style. Unlike the flagship OnePlus 13 and its 6.8-inch QHD Plus display, the 13T delivers a 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen with a 120Hz max refresh rate.</p><p>OnePlus is also highlighting the device's lightweight feel, saying users can hold the device one-handed without fatigue.</p><p>A more standout detail is the new "shortcut key." The OnePlus 13T says goodbye to the fabled Alert Slider for this new multipurpose, frame-integrated button. Placed on the top left side of the phone's edge, the shortcut key gives easy access to your flashlight, sound/vibration (Alert Slider-esque), One-click flash memory, DND, recording, camera, and more.</p><p>OnePlus hopes the 13T's small frame won't disappoint as the phone packs a wallop: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>
<h2 id="gaming-ai-power-2">Gaming & AI Power</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8" name="oneplus-13t-color-options" alt="The OnePlus 13T in a variety of colors: Morning Grey, Heart-pounding Pink, Cloudy Ink Black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this strength has to go somewhere, and OnePlus says the Snapdragon 8 Elite benefits the 13T's gaming capabilities. The company states users can reach up to 120 FPS during MOBA games (think League of Legends) and up to 60 FPS in open-world games (think Genshin Impact).</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus 13T has rich optimization for games such as the ones described to give users a smooth experience when playing.</p><p>The other side of the new phone involves AI advancements, like OnePlus' reflection removal on photos. The 13T also receives AI Elimination (machine-translated), which functions like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, letting users quickly remove people and other objects from photos. OnePlus states ColorOS 15 on the phone is smooth, packing more AI features like AI Call Translation, Flash Memory (for notetaking), and more.</p>
<h2 id="long-lasting-glacier-tech-2">Long-lasting Glacier Tech</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:572px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:101.40%;"><img id="YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD" name="oneplus-13t-rendering-official" alt="The OnePlus 13T in gray." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YSmbEHxzrs5sMvWzmYk8BD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="572" height="580" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With so much under the hood, OnePlus tries to invoke a sense of calm in its users by stating the 13T features its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery technology</a>. However, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-to-sport-a-gigantic-battery-in-its-smaller-form-factor">company recently confirmed</a> on Weibo, the OnePlus 13T is unlike the 13 and 13R counterparts. Each of those features a 6,000mAh battery, while the 13T offers a larger 6,260mAh battery.</p><p>Joining this is 80W super fast charging to ensure users aren't out of the action for long.</p><p>Other specifications include IP65 dust and water resistance, as well as a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto camera. The front-facing lens comes in at 16MP. Users will also find the following RAM/storage configurations: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, 16/256GB, 16/512GB, 16/1TB.</p><p>For now, the OnePlus 13T has observed a Chinese market launch for 3,999 Chinese Yuan (~$548). There's a chance the company will bring it overseas to the U.S. and other areas, but that remains to be seen. If this does happen, perhaps we're in for a global launch toward the summer.</p>

<p>Motorola's new Razr 2025 lineup is here, and it includes a new member: the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025. While the Razr Plus isn't going anywhere, the Razr Ultra now represents the company's top-of-the-line foldable offering. If you have the Razr Plus 2024, you'll want to compare the last-generation model to the Razr Ultra 2025 — not the Razr Plus 2025.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr Ultra 2025</a> earns its new name with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a bigger internal display, and a 50MP selfie camera. However, all of that comes at a high cost. Specifically, the $1,299 sticker price of the Razr Ultra could be a deterrent for some, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> is only getting cheaper by comparison. That's why the older version could actually be the better value.</p><p>Let's break down the differences between the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024, so you can decide which one to buy or whether to upgrade.</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">will become available starting May 15</a>, and pre-orders will start on May 7 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, Amazon, and through Motorola's online store. It starts at $1,300, with a higher-priced 1TB storage configuration available and various carrier and trade-in deals optional. It's available in four Pantone colorways: Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret.</p>

<p>The last-generation Motorola Razr Plus 2024 is still available and has an official retail price of $1,000, but isn't sold at that price often anymore. Motorola, Best Buy, and Amazon all currently have the Razr Plus 2024 priced at $800, and that could drop lower once the Razr 2025 lineup is available. It's sold in one 256GB storage configuration in five colorways: Midnight Blue, Hot Pink, Spring Green, Peach Fuzz, Paris Hilton Edition, and Mocha Mousse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have extremely similar dimensions, with the biggest differences between them being their weight. The Razr Plus 2024, at 189 grams, is 10 grams lighter than the Razr Ultra 2025. This could be enough to notice in your hand or a pocket, especially when the phone is closed. Otherwise, the Razr Ultra is slightly thicker, but the two clamshell foldables have the same general footprint.</p><p>Motorola significantly improved the Razr's durability with this year's lineup. The Razr Ultra 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof">now has an IP48 certification</a>, adding dust resistance for the first time. It does have the same water-resistance rating as the Razr Plus 2024, but the older model is IPX8 and this has no dust protection.</p><p>Additionally, the Razr Ultra 2025 has a new Gorilla Glass Ceramic covering for the cover display. The Razr Plus 2024 only offers Gorilla Glass Victus, and lacks the titanium-reinforced hinge and new foldable display covering found on the new model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-18" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuyQUn9CEfDpMLw4EWxpCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first glance, you might think that the Razr Ultra 2025 and the Razr Plus 2024 have the same cover screen. They do, for all intents and purposes, as they're both 4-inch pOLED panels with LTPO technology and 165Hz refresh rates. But the Razr Ultra 2025 has improved peak brightness capabilities, as it can hit 3,000 nits. The Razr Plus 2024 can only peak at 2,400 nits, which could make it harder to use outdoors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3754px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-09" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RohBotZnfQzj9EcAas6UNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3754" height="2112" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other small display tweak is that the Razr Ultra 2025 has a slightly larger inner screen. It's now using a 7-inch pOLED panel, which is ever-so-slightly bigger than the Razr Plus 2024's 6.9-inch pOLED screen. More importantly, the Razr Ultra 2025 can hit 4,500 nits of peak brightness, a significant improvement over the Plus 2024's 3,000-nit capabilities.</p><p>Motorola is deepening its collaboration with Pantone by offering unique colorways and an Alcantara material on the Razr Ultra 2025, but both that model and the Plus 2024 variant have equally-eccentric color and finish options.</p>

<p>Motorola is offering a truly flagship-caliber flip phone with the Razr Ultra 2025, and that starts with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> on the inside. It's built using Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores for improved performance and features an AI engine for on-device processing. Plus, the phone now has 16GB of memory for all that AI.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2024 is using a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chip that's now a generation old, but it still should be more than capable for daily use. That's paired with 12GB of memory, which again should suffice. Both phones support 5G, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and NFC.</p>

<p>In a way, the Razr Plus 2024 actually has a better camera system than the Razr Ultra 2025, since the former has a telephoto lens. It's a 50MP, f/2.0 telephoto that provides 2x optical zoom on the Razr Plus 2024. There's no optical zoom on the Razr Ultra, as the phone's secondary camera is a 50MP ultrawide with a 122-degree field of view.</p><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 has a new main camera: 50MP, f/1.8 sensor with Instant all-pixel PDAF and optical image stabilization. The Razr Plus 2024's main lens is quite similar, though, as it's also a 50MP sensor but with a f/1.7 aperture and only dual-pixel focus. The Razr Ultra 2025 is equipped with a 50MP selfie camera, while the Razr Plus 2024 has a 32MP selfie camera.</p><p>Of course, since these are foldables, you can always use the rear cameras as a selfie camera with the cover screen.</p><p>The new model ships with Android 15 out of the box, while the Razr Plus 2024 shipped with Android 14, and both are using Motorola's Hello UI skin. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> rollout for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> is said to be ongoing, but the update has had numerous issues this far. Both phones have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-receive">meager update promise of 3 years of OS upgrades</a> and an extra year of security updates.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4089px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-15" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 AI key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hgU4hPwJptqeQeMjBMRSMe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4089" height="2300" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 certainly has the specs to command a $1,299 price tag, but there's no doubt that the Razr Plus 2024 is the better value. The phone still offers the same size cover screen, a capable Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 processor, and a telephoto lens for $500 less than the Ultra 2025 at the time of publishing. It's only getting cheaper, too.</p><p>But if you spring for the Razr Plus 2024, you're accepting a waning software support window that could only see your phone get two more Android OS upgrades — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update that's just months away.</p><p>For those that are willing to pay a lump sum for the best clamshell foldable money can buy in the U.S., the Razr Ultra 2025 is there. There are plenty of durability, performance, and display improvements that can be used to justify the upgrade.

<h2 id="can-border-patrol-search-your-phone-at-the-u-s-border-2">Can border patrol search your phone at the U.S. border?</h2>
<p>Something a little different this week, but it's in the news cycle and is a subject full of questions with very few answers given. I'm talking about crossing into the U.S. and getting your phone searched.</p>
<p>This isn't anything new, or anything because of Donald Trump and Elon Musk. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/cbp_directive_3340-049.pdf" target="_blank">started in 2009</a>, and according to what senior intelligence officials have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/american-citizens-u-s-border-agents-can-search-your-cellphone-n732746" target="_blank">told NBC News</a>, ramped up in 2016 when the FBI was unable to stop American citizens from conducting attacks inside the country they call home.</p><p>It's also not unique to the U.S. and many countries will want to look at your phone, tablet, and laptop upon arrival. I can only speak of what I know, though, so this is going to be very U.S.-centric.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/travel/cbp-search-authority/border-search-electronic-devices#:~:text=CBP's%20border%20authorities%20permit%20the,devices%20crossing%20our%20nation's%20borders." target="_blank"><strong>The United States Customs and Border Patrol can search any object, without any specific level of suspicion, within 100 miles of the U.S. border. That means your backpack, wallet, car, and phone.</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>Civil rights groups and lawmakers are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Letter%20to%20DHS%20re%20border%20searches.pdf" target="_blank">split over the constitutionality</a> of this, but the Department of Homeland Security stands firm that it can conduct warrantless searches of electronics at the U.S. border and they have more guns so they win.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5312px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad" name="airport.jpg" alt="Dulles International Airport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/suvvP7ZTdYzWir6gygJQad.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5312" height="2988" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="can-i-refuse-should-i-2">Can I refuse? Should I?</h2>
<p>Yes, you can refuse but not without consequences. Those depend on your citizenship status.</p><p>If you are an American citizen your electronics can be forcibly removed from your person, but you can not be compelled to provide the password. I said <strong>password</strong> intentionally here because court cases have affirmed that law enforcement can force you to provide a fingerprint or other form of biometric authentication but can not compel you to give up your password.</p><p>Your device can be held for an undetermined amount of time or even denied entry, but you can not be because you did not provide your password. they'll have to find another reason if they want to deny you entry or detain you, and they probably will.</p><p>If you are not a U.S. citizen the answer is easier; turn over the phone and the password if asked or go back home. The government says you have no right to enter the country and you have to follow all rules and directives to gain access. If you don't, you are turned away.</p>
<p>As for what you should do, well that's not for me to say. I know what I would do and why: I would tell them I am a U.S. citizen and they can pound sand, let them hold me against the wall and pull my phone out of my pocket, and never tell them the password. I will never give up an inch of my liberty willingly and unless they helped pay for the phone or the service, they aren't getting it.</p><p>That's a narrow and possibly dangerous way to think and I can't recommend it. But you need to ask yourself the same question and form your own answer.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7" name="android-enterprise-recommended-hero.jpg" alt="Android Enterprise" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2gGtboCUmgFz22uo33T7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>The first thing to do if you carry a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-enterprise-recommended">work phone</a> is ask your boss what to do. Your company probably has very strict access rules for its information and may have an existing policy; a large car manufacturer has told its employees to refuse and get on the first plane back to Germany, for example.</p><p>For your personal device, you can do a few things to minimize your personal risk. There are two levels of search, a basic search and a seizure. For a basic search an officer will gain access and look through your device, They will look at your photos, messages, social media, etc. to see if they find anything suspicious.</p><p>The next level involves an agent connecting your phone to equipment that clones the data so it can be looked at more thoroughly. This requires "reasonable suspicion" though what that is has never been defined.</p>
<ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security"><em><strong>See our guide to the best phones for security in 2025</strong></em></a></li></ul>
<p>What I would do if I were a foreign national on the way into the U.S., and what I'll recommend to you isn't difficult at all: don't give them any reason to be suspicious.</p><p><strong>Do not wipe your phone</strong>. Presenting a phone that's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-factory-reset-android-phone">reset</a> is the opposite of not acting suspiciously. Don't do it.</p><p><strong>Turn off biometrics</strong>. this doesn't protect you if you're not a citizen, but it's a hurdle that's not suspicious. If they want in, make them ask and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-disable-biometrics-on-your-android-phone-from-the-lock-screen">allow access on your terms</a>.</p><p><strong>Make sure you haven't turned off encryption</strong>. That's not easy to do and unless you did something you found on the internet, you probably didn't. This goes for your apps, their associated data, and the entire contents of the phone itself. When the screen is locked, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-googles-backup-encryption-works-good-bad-and-ugly">everything should be encrypted</a>.</p><p><strong>Don't delete your social media</strong>. Clean it up instead. Delete any posts you think might cause you trouble in case they are saved on your phone.</p><p><strong>Delete your local data</strong>. Go through your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-now-lets-you-spice-up-your-pictures-with-ultra-hdr-glow">photos</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-and-when-clear-app-cache-or-data-android">application cache</a>, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-clear-browsing-data-shortcut">browser history</a>, and anything else that stores what you're been doing and erase it.</p><p><strong>Disconnect your phone</strong> <strong>from the internet</strong>. CBP is not allowed to look through your online data, but your apps often present it when opened. If you're not connected, they can't. Legally, an officer is required to ask you to disconnect from the internet before a search of your phone is started. Don't wait for them to ask.</p><p><strong>Don't be a jerk</strong>. It might be tempting and I know I would do or say something stupid, but try not to. If you're acting like a jerk they might, too. Follow directions and ask questions respectfully no matter how you feel about the situation.</p>

<p>Realistically, your phone probably isn't going to be searched upon entry. Certain groups have a higher chance (no, we're not diving into that plie of racism and xenophobia) and are treated differently, but at most expect a cursory look at your phone when you come into the country.</p><p>If it does happen, be prepared. It's a price you might have to pay if you want to visit the U.S.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Rumors claim Samsung's development of a Galaxy S25 FE continues, but with some older internal tech.</li><li>The device may feature the company's toned-down Exynos 2400e, the same chip found inside the S24 FE.</li><li>Samsung has done this before, like the Galaxy S23 FE, which features the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors say Samsung's next flagship series' FE device is real, but it might not excite you with raw strength.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-m36-5g-soc-leak-3546771/">Android Authority</a> through a "reliable source" states internal code points toward the existence of a Galaxy S25 FE. The post says Samsung typically attaches an "R" modifier to devices belonging to its FE series. With that in mind, there's reportedly code with the name "R13," which seemingly points toward the S25 FE.</p><p>A more usual/normal codename that we're used to hearing about wasn't readily available, but this might be our first glimpse of its development.</p><p>More importantly, Samsung's internal code details another important aspect of the phone: its potential SoC. Sources lead the publication to believe the device could launch with the Exynos 2400e SoC due to its internal tag appearing alongside code for the S25 FE.</p>
<h2 id="year-old-tech-again-2">Year-Old Tech... Again?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-mint-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtxvdX499hQ8iyMTHK6Yj4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We can take these rumors with a grain of salt, considering how the device might not launch for a while. However, there's a chance this could come to fruition, considering Samsung has a past of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">using year-old tech in its FE phones</a>. One device we can look back on is the Galaxy S23 FE. After launching in the fall of 2023, its detailed specs showed Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 SoC, the flagship chip choice for phones launching in 2022.</p><p>What's arguably the most relevant example is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>. The alleged chip for the S25 FE, the Exynos 2400e, is currently featured inside Samsung's latest fan edition phone. It's worth keeping in mind that while it wasn't a bad chip, for its time last September, the 2400e is roughly 100MHz slower than its stronger 2400.</p><p>The chip clocks in at 3.11GHz, which is far slower than Samsung's recent choice of the Snapdragon 8 Elite with a 4.47GHz in its flagship S25 trio.</p><p>The idea of a "Fan Edition" phone is to appeal to the more affordable market, so it's expected not to hold the same power as a flagship. We'll have to see where things end up, as rumors claim the Galaxy S25 FE could see a launch in the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>Anyone my age will likely recall seeing Toy Story for the first time. I had just celebrated my 10th birthday a few weeks before its release, and to say I was thrilled to see toys come to life in fancy new CG animation was an understatement. It also helped that Pixar was a master at storytelling.</p><p>The idea of toys themselves moving around and playing was a concept that continued to stick with me over the years. Toy Commander, a 1999 Dreamcast release, remains one of the most memorable games of my childhood because it shares that same theme, and now some recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest 3 games</a> have caught my attention in the same way.</p><p>Recently, Plastic Battlegrounds has been trending <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@plasticbattlegrounds">on TikTok</a>, racking up millions of views with shorts that perfectly recreate those moments when you played with plastic army men as a kid. The difference is that now you're not just moving the little guys around, you're actually fighting alongside them, commanding them, or just seeing what it's like to pretend to be Sid.</p>

<h2 id="plastic-battlegrounds-2">Plastic Battlegrounds</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8frQwGO665I" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Plastic Battlegrounds debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/plastic-battlegrounds/7796723770415439/">on the Meta Quest platform</a> on October 14, 2024. While it's a sandbox game still very much in development, the classic theme and the impulse buy price of $9.99 quickly rocketed it to success. The game describes itself as "<strong>the</strong> newly commissioned sandbox toy-based battle simulator where your plastic soldiers engage in intense set piece battles of your imagination."</p><p>That last part is key. Plastic Battlegrounds isn't going to blow anyone's minds with its advanced AI or cutting-edge graphics. The game looks fine enough on a Meta Quest 3S, but the real joy is recreating scenes from your childhood and, maybe even more relevant today, <em>making content</em> from those ideas.</p><p>Because, let's face it, there's something fun about making your own version of Toy Story with your own ideas at the helm. Since you can choose either to embody a toy soldier or get a kids-eye view of the scene and command them, there are plenty of ways to work the angles and come up with a creative story along the way.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tv37Nb54D6M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The video above embodies the true spirit of the game and what I think is the real fun in playing it: pretending. There's something truly amazing about seeing plastic soldiers come to life. Being able to spawn them and command them just adds a cherry on top, and the game's different levels all help realize a childhood fantasy of being a tiny toy in a giant room.</p>

<p>The developers specifically note that Plastic Battlegrounds was designed as a sandbox game, but two other modes are currently available and in active development. "Sandbox would be the optimal game mode to get the most out of the Plastic Battlegrounds experience," they note, and it's clear from social media posts that people love playing this way.</p><p>In this mode, you embody a plastic soldier and can spawn, command, and fight your own way through an unlimited number of enemies and scenarios. A bunch of different maps — kitchen, basement, hallway, backyard, etc. — give you different parts of the house to play in, and each of the two alternative modes gives you additional options.</p><p>Spawning in units is simple, but you'll want to be careful not to spam that spawn button too many times. While a Quest 3 or 3S can handle lots of units just fine, a Quest 2 will have a tougher time managing a decent framerate. I look forward to seeing where this game's development takes it, especially if the developers can get a good multiplayer mode going.</p>

<p>Plastic Battlegrounds might be trending right now, but it was Toy Trains VR that gave me the first "Toy Story" feelings more than a year ago. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/toy-trains/5655022154520888/">Toy Trains VR</a> is an absolutely brilliant puzzle game that's polished in a way most Meta Quest games wish they could be. The goal is to assemble a toy train track to connect all the towns in an area, helping to transport goods between each location.</p><p>The game sports a uniquely toy-like quality with excellent graphics — complete with a fur-shaded carpet — all of which takes place in your grandfather's attic. I can remember venturing up to my grandparent's attic when I was a kid and finding similar sets of trains, so this one immediately evoked a sense of nostalgia for me.</p>

<p>What I love about Toy Trains VR is that it's not just a sandbox game, although there is a sandbox mode if you love that sort of thing. Rather, the main single player mode follows a heartwarming story that's well put together AND well voiced, something that adds a rather intriguing bit of character to what would otherwise be "just a puzzle game."</p><p>And that brings me to the mechanics. The available tracks are cleverly laid out for you to grab, letting you know exactly how many, and what type, of pieces are available for you to finish each puzzle. The introductory levels are quite easy and give you a good idea of what to expect, while the later levels will provide sufficient challenges for even hardcore puzzle fans (that is a thing, right?).</p>

<p>Before both of these other games, though, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/lego-bricktales-meta-quest-3-impressions">LEGO Bricktales</a>. This brilliant puzzle platformer puts a life-sized LEGO diorama in front of players' faces, letting you control a LEGO character that traverses each area as you build the missing pieces.</p><p>It was originally shown off as one of the premier mixed reality titles when the Meta Quest 3 was first announced, and the result was even better than I had hoped. While some might have just wanted a plain sandbox LEGO game, I far prefer this style of storytelling that melds nicely with LEGO construction.</p><p>While most LEGO games are the same — third-person action games with lots of combat and collection but little brain usage — LEGO Bricktales rewards players who enjoy exploration and puzzle solving. It's particularly amazing being able to fully walk around these life-sized dioramas and find the secrets hidden within.</p><p>There's a serious childlike wonderment that bubbles up inside me while playing this game, and it made me freshly appreciate the spatial nature of VR games. It's even nicer that you can have the whole game hover in front of you no matter where you stand (or sit), giving you the freedom to fully explore or build each piece as if it were real.</p>

<p>Watch faces on Wear OS are one of the best ways to let your personality shine, and I frequently swap between them based on my mood. But one thing I hadn't considered before someone asked me was which Wear OS brand had the <em>best</em> watch faces.</p><p>So I fired up my Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Google Pixel Watch 3 to look through every watch face, complication, and color variations available, and compare what style and data they bring to the table.</p><p>Then I bullied my colleagues Andrew Myrick and Nick Sutrich into looking through every watch face on their TicWatch Atlas and OnePlus Watch 3, respectively, since I wanted every Wear OS brand (besides the Eurasia-only Xiaomi) represented.</p><p>Let's dive in and compare first-party Wear OS watch faces for style, variety, customization, and quantity.</p>

<p>The sheer diversity of watch faces in the Galaxy Wearable app is impressive. Virtually every non-gimmicky Samsung-made watch face has dozens of colors, several customizations, and more system complications than any other brand, while the downloadable third-party options have more limited variations but give you a wider range of styles.</p><p>I highly recommend using the Wearable phone app to look through and edit your watch faces; the on-watch customization options work well enough, but some "premade" variations only show up in the mobile app.</p><p>Specific to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, you'll find some Ultra watch faces that take advantage of the extra space to fit up to eight complications. I typically use this for my Samsung Health data, but there's a wide range of Google- and Samsung-made toggles for popular apps.</p>

<p>More generally, Samsung has more animated or "live" watch faces than other Wear OS brands, like Funny faces, My style, Live Wallpaper, or Friends. They're quite cool (if a bit distracting), with unique smarts like pointing out when you have unread notifications or swapping patterns with a tap.</p><p>Once the novelty wears off, I avoid animated watch faces, not only because of battery drain, but also because they rarely leave room for any non-clock data fields. The latter also applies to custom faces like Google Photos or Bitmoji.</p><p>Out of Samsung's watch face categories, I'm a fan of the Analog and Informative faces: they squeeze in tons of useful information while making that crowdedness look intentional and stylish. For something more colorful and minimalistic, the Numbers faces are great.</p><p>I'm less of a fan of the Classic and Simple faces, because they look a bit too minimalist and don't really fit the <em>look</em> of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or Ultra; they'd be better suited to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>.</p>

<p>Google made the smart choice of making every premade watch face customization visible in the main "Add watch faces" menu. So even though it has half as many official watch faces as Samsung, it <em>looks</em> like hundreds because each face has 5–10 premade variations.</p><p>Plus, Google lets you look at and customize faces before committing to one, while Samsung makes you add them to your watch before you can see your options.</p><p>Logistics aside, half of Google's watch faces follow the Material You aesthetic with bright colors and large clocks that run up against the edge of the rounded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3 </a>display. The rest either fall into data-heavy fitness or traditional classic/ analog faces that you see on most smartwatches.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick said that Pixel Watch faces "have the best style because they fit so well with the watch's aesthetic, but a lot of them are pretty useless other than to tell the time."</p><p>I'm quoting him because I couldn't put it better myself: faces like Digital Bold, Big Time, Abstract, and Vista look striking enough, but some — especially Large Scale and Prime — are a bit too simplistic with their sans-serif fonts and empty space.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-main-watch-face.jpeg" alt="The default Active watch face on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/djRQVHZ4MWGxuunYgjQAQ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Active watch face </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google made "Active" the default face for a reason, I think. Its rounded fonts and bright colors look Google-ish, but it leaves plenty of room for Fitbit complications or Google app shortcuts that people buy Pixel Watches for. I tend to like the busyness of the Field and Adventure faces more than the minimalist look of faces like Index and Utility.</p><p>Whichever watch face you end up with, I think Google does the best job of making its AOD-mode faces look like a stylish inverse of the active face, while other brands' AOD mode simply dims the screen or removes elements.</p>

<p>Nick looked over each of the 19 OnePlus watch faces, but admitted that after his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3 review</a>, he's continued to stick with the default watch face, whereas he didn't care for the main Watch 2 face.</p><p>"I feel like all of the best ones on this watch take full advantage of the 1.5-inch screen size and cram a bunch of info onto it," Nick explained, "whereas my favorite Pixel Watch faces are very minimalist because they look good on the shape."</p><p>While OnePlus has a decent amount of variety and plenty of complications, none of its alternative watch faces have tempted Nick to switch. It's been a while since I've taken out my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>, but I also don't recall its official watch faces being particularly striking during that review stretch.</p><p>OnePlus does have a unique video watch face feature, but like Samsung's animated faces, I doubt people will stick with this battery-draining gimmick. I think a bigger priority for OnePlus is to add more stylish watch faces in general that match with its Classic titanium chic.</p>
<h2 id="mobvoi-ticwatch-faces-2">Mobvoi TicWatch faces</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-1" alt="TicWatch Atlas sitting in dirt and rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Andrew, like Nick, isn't that impressed with the watch faces on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-review">TicWatch Atlas</a>. Of the 15 available — including the TimeShow app — he says that he regularly switches between five of them. That's not a bad rotation, but he "doesn't have much of an opinion on the other 10 besides them just taking up space." Ouch!</p><p>His favorite, shown in the photo above, is the same sort of data-heavy, fitness-focused face that you'd expect on any fitness watch, focused on cramming in a lot of information. Compared to that, the faces that "try to look like an 'actual' watch just aren't that appealing" to Andrew.</p><p>Part of this comes down to preference, of course, but it's also fair to point out that because Mobvoi has fewer first-party watch faces than most Wear OS brands, you're less likely to find many that fit your tastes.</p><p>Thankfully, Mobvoi does at least have plenty of Google and TicWatch complications available, if not quite as many as its Wear OS rivals. You also get an ultra-basic watch face on the battery-saving secondary screen that does, at least, come in dozens of color options.</p>
<h2 id="which-is-the-best-wear-os-brand-for-watch-faces-2">Which is the best Wear OS brand for watch faces?</h2>

<p>Objectively, it's hard to argue against Samsung Galaxy Watches here. Whether you prefer classic, analog, minimalist, data-heavy, or gimmicky motion watch faces, Samsung gives you the most options, with different fits to match the standard, Classic, or Ultra models.</p><p>Google prioritizes style over ruggedness, and the lack of a bezel makes its faces stand out more prominently than other brands' faces. But your opinion of them will depend on what you think of Google's modern Material You theming. You get very few "classic" faces, and it's hard to differentiate between faces when every single one has a black background.</p><p>Either brand gives you plenty of customization options, but I think Samsung lets you choose one to match your personality while Google railroads you a bit to its style.</p><p>Ultimately, I'm happy with what both brands bring to the table, but I still think that Google needs to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-blocks-facer-and-makes-watch-faces-boring">unblock Facer</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> so that it's easier to find third-party options outside of the messy Play Store. And I'm also curious if Google will consider letting us use Gemini to generate pretty watch face backgrounds.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a 7-inch, 1,224p AMOLED HDR10+ Super HD inner screen with adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 4,500 nits peak brightness. It’s a Pantone-validated display so you’ll get Pantone-validated colors and skin tones. The outer screen is a 4-inch pOLED HDR10+ 417ppi screen with the same adaptive 165Hz refresh rate and 3,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Available in Pantone colors, including Rio Red, Scarab, Mountain Trail, and Cabaret, you can choose from luxe satin-inspired or durable leather-inspired finishes. It’s the first phone to use Italian Alcantara material, the same you’ll find on items like Louis Vuitton bags. There’s also an option for FSC-certified wood so you can choose the design and material that suits you.</p><p>Covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic, the phone is durable, marking the toughest external display of any Razr to date. The phone meets an IP48 rating for dust and water resistance. It has a titanium-reinforced hinge that Motorola says is four times stronger than surgical-grade stainless steel and can withstand up to 35% more folds than the previous generation device. Ultra-thin glass also ensures a smoother display.</p><p>Customize the external display with dedicated panels for things like contacts, communications apps, streaming music, weather, and more. The phone also has dual stereo speakers that support Dolby Atmos and three microphones.</p><p>Equipped with 512GB or 1TB storage, you can load tons of games, apps, photos, videos, and more onto this 5G foldable phone. It charges via USB-C and has a 4,700mAh battery that supports 68W TurboPower charging (get a full day in just eight minutes) as well as 30W wireless charging and 5W reverse charging.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes in Blue, Yellow, Mint, or Silver Shadow, plus Samsung exclusive colors Crafted Black, White, and Peach. The foldable design consists of a 3.4-inch 720 x 748 inner Super AMOLED screen with a 90Hz refresh rate and 1,700 nits peak brightness that unfolds to reveal the larger 6.7-inch 2,640 x 1,080 FHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2x 120Hz main screen with 2,600 nits brightness.</p><p>Slim and compact with a floating design, the phone is relatively durable, sporting an IP48 rating for resistance against dust and water as well. The screen is made of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and it has a reinforced folding edge with the FlexHinge for easily opening and closing it along with an Armor Aluminum frame with a matte finish. Derrek Lee says in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">review of the Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> that the hinge is stiff and sturdy, as is the phone in its entirety. He adds that the crease is hardly noticeable.</p><p>Lee isn’t fond of the design of the external screen, however, finding that it offers limited ability to interact with notifications or even scroll through details or select different days. He also finds that apps feel condensed, making navigating UIs awkward.</p><p>Equipped with 256GB or 512GB non-expandable storage, the 5G device charges via USB-C, the port of which also works as an ear jack. Other specs include Bluetooth 5.3, GPS, NFC, and stereo speakers. The dialogue booster feature is appreciated, and Lee says it does “exactly as it states, and works surprisingly well.” He also loves the haptics that emit a slight vibration when you type, swipe back, or open the sidebar.</p><p>The phone runs on a 4,000mAh battery and supports 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and 4.5W reverse wireless charging. It lasts all day on a single charge: Lee would get from about 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. before needing to recharge. But it charges much more slowly than the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025, so this is worth keeping in mind for power users.</p>

<p>As a newer phone released in late April 2025, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 comes loaded with Android 15. If following the pattern of other Razr devices, you should get three years of software and four years of security updates, which is decent but not quite as long as Samsung’s standard.</p><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 runs on a Snapdragon 8 Elite octa-core processor, making it the most powerful foldable phone on the market today. It also comes with an impressive 16GB RAM. It also supports Motorola’s RAM Boost feature which allows you to convert available storage space to RAM when needed, though we’ve had mixed experiences with this feature in the past.</p><p>The phone is built with moto AI, which includes tons of cool AI-powered features leveraging the dedicated on-device AI engine, like Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This. Next Move takes advantage of the external display, recognizing what’s on the screen and offering suggestions for the next step. It could be, for example, generating a playlist with Playlist Studio while you bake a cake from an online recipe, or creating an image or wallpaper in Image Studio that’s inspired by an upcoming trip.</p><p>There’s also Smart Connect with AI that allows you to use voice or text commands to do things like pull up a video on your big screen TV or mirror content to a secondary device like a PC or tablet for multitasking. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 even has a dedicated AI key that you can press to access moto AI at any time. In his initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">hands-on review of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a>, Lee says he appreciates this dedicated button versus having this feature double on the power button.</p><p>Flip the phone into stand or tent mode and chat hands-free with moto AI to ask questions, summarize notifications, or transcribe conversations. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 also comes with Google’s Gemini and Gemini Live access so you can use this smart assistant and all the features that come with it as well. Lee is impressed by the addition of even more AI apps, like Meta’s Llama, Microsoft Copilot, and even Perplexity. Motorola is really upping its AI game with this phone.</p><p>We’ll provide more details on the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 once we have had more time to spend with it and can deliver a full review.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Comparatively, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 comes loaded with Android 14 with One UI 6.1.1 since it’s already a year old. However, you get seven years of software and security updates. So, you can not only update to Android 15, you’ll be able to continue updating for another six years to come.</p><p>Running on a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 octa-core processor, Lees says it performs “exceptionally well…this phone breezes through everything you throw at it.” It has a Vapor Chamber to keep it cool while multitasking or gaming, marking a first for a Galaxy Z Flip device. Lee says it occasionally gets warm while gaming, but never uncomfortably hot. Equipped with 12GB RAM, this phone can keep up with the most demanding tasks and games.</p><p>Built with Galaxy AI and Google Gemini, you get the same Google Gemini AI experiences that are available in other AI-powered phones, like Circle to Search, live translate, and transcript assist. You can use the Gemini assistant for everything from help composing e-mails to summarizing webpages and booking vacations. But there are also some unique Galaxy AI features that make use of the foldable design.</p><p>There’s interpreter, for example, that leverages the Flex Window for real-time language translations, one of the top features for making use of the external display. Lee finds that it works well. With Chat Assist, you can send messages directly from the FlexWindow, even choosing from suggested replies that are curated by the content-aware AI.</p><p>Lee loves features like Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image, which he calls “truly fascinating,” turning your doodles into works of art. He’s less impressed with Portrait Studio but loves the Live Effect feature for transforming 2D photos into cinematic videos. Other worthwhile features include Slo-Mo for saving clips, Composer for writing comments, e-mails, and more based on past conversations and prompts, and the Recorder app.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3953px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-02" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 in a red ring stand case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPhLx9TFxTKf3sUC29ECvd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3953" height="2224" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For taking photos and videos, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 has a triple 50MP camera system that includes a main 50MP camera, a 50MP ultra-wide camera with Macro Vision, and a 50MP front camera. You get features like Super Zoom and plenty of the usual camera modes.</p><p>There’s also Group Shot for capturing multiple frames within a second and seamlessly blending them together for a perfect shot. With Action Shot, you can get blur-free photos of subjects on the move as the shutter speed adjusts automatically based on lighting conditions. And there’s Air Gesture for capturing photos and videos using hand gestures to start, stop, and pause recording. Leverage Flex View positions as well for things like tripod shots, gesture controls, and external previews.</p><p>We haven’t been able to spend significant time with the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just yet to provide feedback on the camera experience. Stay tuned!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-06.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 in Camcorder Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3wga9PVH57KmCYYXtjYrm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4197" height="2361" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Take photos from the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 using the 50MP main camera along with the 12MP ultra-wide and 10MP front “selfie” camera. There are options like Nightography, instant slo-mo, and live effect, all of which make use of the ProVisual Engine. There are plenty of photography features powered by AI as well, like generative edit.</p><p>Lee finds that photos have plenty of contrast, depth, and vibrancy with this phone, though he says the camera does struggle with dynamic range. Skies in photos, for example, will often appear blown out. The cameras also struggle with movement, so you may end up with blurry images that lack detail and with some distortion at the edges of the image if the subject is moving. But he was able to capture some great moving images of objects like cars and animals like a cat.</p><p>The camera handles zooming and low light well, he adds, but he isn’t a fan of how his darker skin looks when taking selfies with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. Given the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025’s focus on skin tones, this gives it a massive leg up in this department.</p><p>For recording videos, Lee loves the feature that turns the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 into a camcorder when you fold it 90° and hold it sideways. The UI adjusts to fit the viewfinder at the top half while you can use a zoom slider on the bottom while recording. Neat! He recommends downloading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a> to get more useful features, including a 2x button for faster zooming, auto HDR, and a faster shutter button.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3878px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="J8ZiCbu3S8MbeR34ZNnQ4d" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-07" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with a ring around the cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J8ZiCbu3S8MbeR34ZNnQ4d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3878" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes down to specs of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is the all-around better phone. It has larger screens yet isn’t that much bigger. It has a bigger battery, a better front camera, and tons of AI features through both Gemini and moto AI.</p><p>It has more RAM, more storage, charges more quickly, and comes in tons of finish and material options. If you’re not already within the Samsung ecosystem and you’re looking for a solid foldable phone, it’s the better model to consider. But it’s also more expensive so it will make a bigger dent in your wallet. That’s the one early concern Lee has, despite noting that the phone is a huge step up with “the best hardware and all the AI it can include in its phones.”</p><p>Plus, this phone won’t be supported for as long as the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6, which will be up to date for another six years. If longevity is your main concern, you’ll get more bang for the buck with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6. And it has some really impressive features, too.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 currently ranks as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">the best foldable phone</a>, but the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is prepped to give it a run for its money. If you have the money to spare and you’re looking for an ultra-durable, feature-rich foldable phone, the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 is certainly one to consider.</p>

<ul><li>Google has kickstarted an Extended Repair Program for users with a Pixel 7a.</li><li>This comes off the back of it identifying issues of "battery swelling," which could lead to a bulging rear panel and quicker than normal battery drain.</li><li>If users have an impacted device, they must run through the checks to see if they're eligible to see their next steps.</li><li>Google's had to run similar programs for the Pixel 8 and Pixel 4 XL, as well as a few Fitbit devices earlier this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly identified a problematic battery issue plaguing the Pixel 7a and is detailing your next steps if affected.</p><p>The company published a support document for the Pixel 7a's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453">Extended Repair Program</a>, which concerns a "battery swelling" issue (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/23/pixel-7a-extended-repair-program/">9to5Google</a>). User reports may have tipped Google off about this issue. The company states it has "determined that certain Pixel 7a phones may experience unexpected battery swelling." Battery swelling is a serious issue that consumers should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">deal with accordingly</a> should their device shows signs of it.</p><p>Google states you can identify instances of battery swelling if the back of your phone is bulging/appears thicker than usual. Moreover, you'll notice small gaps around the edge of your phone, indicating the battery is pressing against and lifting its back panel.</p><p>Once you've checked to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone?p=pixel7a_battery_flow&sjid=3542098779619822395-NA">if your Pixel 7a is eligible</a>, Google says impacted devices can receive "one battery replacement at no charge" through its battery replacement program. Additionally, Google will conduct a thorough inspection of the device to ensure you can receive this treatment. Keep in mind that if your battery displays any sign of liquid damage, sharp object exposure, or "excessive force," that may void your eligibility for a free replacement through the program.</p>

<p>Once you've gone through the checks, Google says users should find mail-in and walk-in repair center options. Those in the U.S. and India will find both options available; however, others in Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, and Singapore will only have the repair center choice available.</p><p>Also, these countries, excluding the U.S. and India, will find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16043453#:~:text=and%20warranty%20status).-,Appeasement%20options,-Carefully%20select%20your">a few appeasement options</a> for their Pixel 7a troubles. Such options include a $200 payment (converted to a user's local currency).</p><p>Google has a history of running repair programs for its Pixel phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-goes-all-in-on-fixing-pixel-8-screen-issues-with-a-warranty-extension">like the Pixel 8</a> in 2024. Users reported screen issues for a few months, prompting the company to take action and solve the issues: vertical lines and randomly turning green. If consumers had an "Impacted Device," Google was granting a three-year extended warranty to cover users.

<h2 id="how-to-pick-the-right-shade-of-the-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-to-buy-2">How to pick the right shade of the Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 to buy</h2>
<p>Motorola has finally released a proper flagship, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">top-of-the-line foldable</a> with a thousand-dollar price tag to match. It only makes sense that the most exciting foldable of the year so far should come in four colors that are the opposite of cliche. The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 color is available in a quad of striking colors. Choosing the right one involves listening to your inner desires and color matching the Razr Ultra to your style.</p><p>Rio Red is all class and elegance. This deep brick red hue is warm, luxurious, and rich. It isn't as bright as some of the other reds we've seen from Motorola, but this might be a good thing for folks who prefer more muted shades. It's the most striking colorway to go for, especially in that timeless vegan leather finish.</p><p>The other hue that demands attention this time around is the wooden Mountain Trail variant in all of its champagne gold glory. It's almost deceptive to the eye because the wood somehow emanates a metallic texture. This captivating Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 colorway is my second recommendation if the Rio Red just isn't doing it for you. Mountain Trail has oomph and pizzaz, sure to dazzle you for all the years you hold on to your Razr Ultra.</p>
