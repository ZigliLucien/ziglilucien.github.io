                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I dislike Google TV with a passion; Google took a clean Android TV interface and riddled it with ads and unwanted recommendations. That's why I still use the Shield TV Pro — it's the one Android TV box that actually does a good job, and doesn't automatically lag if you use the TV for more than a few minutes. <br><br>Regardless of whether it's high-end projectors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-aura-2-is-the-ultimate-ust-upgrade">XGIMI Aura 2</a> or budget TVs, Google TV just doesn't feel great to use. Indian brand Lumio is looking to change that with the debut of its TVs; the brand rolled out the QLED Vision 7 and the Mini-LED Vision 9 in the country earlier this month, and both models have plenty of differentiated features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJfz83p9UYTxAfhtbPfke4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJfz83p9UYTxAfhtbPfke4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what I like the most about Lumio is the software; it's still using Google TV, but the brand outfitted all of its TVs — even the base model — with 3GB of DDR4 memory, and it made several tweaks to the interface to make it fluid. The result is the only TV I've ever used that doesn't feel slow; Lumio is calling its products the fastest TVs in India, and that is actually true.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fm4kfJr5rMR2NVNh2vKfm4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fm4kfJr5rMR2NVNh2vKfm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lumio says that its TVs will continue to be fast even after several years, and that's something I will put to the test. While Lumio itself is a new entity, it consists of Xiaomi India veterans, and it's clear that the brand knows what it's doing in this category — and has the requisite manufacturing contacts and after-sales network to go up against established manufacturers.</p><p>In fact, Lumio's TVs are manufactured at Dixon — the same as Xiaomi. What's great to see is that there's a standard two-year warranty on all of Lumio's TVs, and the brand established an after-sales network in the country.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GxHaYiniUngPsMBHa3jVd4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GxHaYiniUngPsMBHa3jVd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't talk much about the quality of the hardware as I was sent a pre-production unit for testing, but the picture quality itself is among the best in its segment. The Vision 9 in particular is a good choice, going up to 550 nits in regular use and 900 nits with HDR content. It handles Dolby Vision and HDR content well, and it has a dedicated quantum dot layer with 2,000 mini LEDs housed inside the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBYuoLGshoD9gLCAMvrms4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBYuoLGshoD9gLCAMvrms4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lumio did a decent job with its image engine, and colors are calibrated out of the box. Sound quality is pretty decent as well, and Lumio managed to deliver a clean sound that doesn't distort even at high volumes. The Vision 7 is a great value, delivering 400 nits and a dedicated quantum dot layer. Clearly, Lumio is aiming to differentiate its devices with the picture quality, and being a new brand taking on much bigger rivals like Xiaomi, it needed to do that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBcVHGJwjeUEQRscGoXmr4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBcVHGJwjeUEQRscGoXmr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TVs get HDMI 2.1 ports as standard too, but the key omission is variable refresh — they're locked to 60Hz. That's annoying as the rest of the hardware is quite decent, and Lumio says it is targeting a mainstream audience with the Vision 7 and Vision 9, so it didn't include VRR. That's also the reason why the Vision 9 is only available in a 55-inch variant, with the Vision 7 retailing in 43 inch, 50 inch, and 55 inches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="imzeW9kHRkKuHZftrJ2ob4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imzeW9kHRkKuHZftrJ2ob4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's entirely likely we'll get a 65-inch model down the line with VRR, but at launch, the size is limited to 55 inches. That isn't much of a downside considering the intended audience, and honestly, Lumio did a good job with the basics. On that note, the brand's TVs are powered by a quad-core silicon that uses Cortex A75 cores, and it gets AV1 decode as standard — a necessity these days.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AbAeewyYL29sEEtRhyUwX4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbAeewyYL29sEEtRhyUwX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the biggest differentiator with Lumio's TVs is the software; the Google TV interface is much better to use than just about any other TV I used, and that's no exaggeration. I use Xiaomi's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-qled-tv-75-review">75-inch Mi QLED TV 75</a> in my living room, and it has been a constant source of frustration. It regularly freezes with the most mundane of tasks — powering on and switching sources to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Shield TV Pro</a> — and I have to cold reset the TV every other day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sURsvoVjSSAeSMARov5BX4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sURsvoVjSSAeSMARov5BX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Android TV interface on that TV is so slow that it just doesn't make sense to use Xiaomi's software, the panel quality is good enough that I continue to use it daily. That's why I'm excited about Lumio's entry into this category; even Sony, Samsung, and LG mid-range TVs have issues with stability and lag, and it's great to see a brand address that issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CMHJNviwctDzG2dQUbZtg4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMHJNviwctDzG2dQUbZtg4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another standout addition is TL;DR, a custom hub that pulls sports scores into a unified dashboard. It does a fantastic job, and offers a vast overview of the action across several leagues. Lumio is doing a similar thing with music as well, collating various sources so you can just listen to music without having to muddle through various playlists and services. The music tech plugs into YouTube Music as of now, but Lumio says it is trying to get other music providers onboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cz5fiCZ5JcJWkQ4R2FX8r4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cz5fiCZ5JcJWkQ4R2FX8r4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, Lumio did all the right things with the Vision 9. It's aimed at a mainstream audience, but the TV has great picture quality, decent sound, and the best software of any TV around. What's noteworthy is that it made a Google TV product I actually want to use — now I just need Lumio to build a streamer to take on the Shield TV Pro.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>After rolling it out in Korea, Samsung is now kicking off the April 2025 security update for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra in Australia.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series update, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">first hit South Korea late last week</a>, weighs in at 762MB and bumps up security to April 2025. It sneaks in a couple of tweaks—though Samsung’s official notes only mention improved system stability.</p>
<h2 id="a-fresh-charging-animation-2">A fresh charging animation</h2>
<p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1914184457273090505" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the April 2025 update brings a few fresh One UI 7-style features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">latest and greatest Samsung phones</a>. One standout is the revamped charging animation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-april-2025-update-expansion/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). Once exclusive to One UI 7 Beta testers, it is now rolling out to S25 owners.</p><p>This means that the battery icon up top on the right now gets a slick animated glow with a green background. It’s a much cleaner, more polished look than what shipped with the Galaxy S25 at launch.</p><p>The update also refreshes the media player in the notification panel. Now, when you're playing something, a live Now Bar pops up in the top-left corner showing what’s playing. Tap it, and you get full playback controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-19" alt="Not Bar on the Galaxy S25 Plus with music controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As with previous software versions, the media widget still lives in the Quick Settings panel. Both of these new tweaks are already part of the stable One UI 7 build running on the Galaxy S24 series.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-shuffled-priorities-2">Samsung shuffled priorities</h2>
<p>Samsung is usually quick with monthly security patches for its flagships, but this month has been a bit different. Instead of pushing the April update to the Galaxy S25 lineup right away, the company focused on finally getting the stable One UI 7 build out for its 2024 flagships, which had been running fashionably late.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-rollout-continues-new-build">pushing out the Android 15 update for Galaxy S24 devices</a>, Samsung is now turning its attention to the S25 series with April's security patch.</p><p>To spot the latest Galaxy S25 update, look for a build number that ends in AYD9. To install it, open Settings, tap on Software update, and then hit Download and install.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe, but we're likely just months away from Samsung releasing a new foldable: the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. As the expected launch window gets closer, more rumors and leaks will continue to roll in, giving us a better picture of what the upcoming foldable might offer.</p><p>Aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7's expected price point and specs, buyers are going to want to know how the phone will shake up against major competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. That's why we're here to provide an early, speculative look at how these two phones compare based on current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumors and leaks</a>. Let's dive in!</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AFKgVKgEBrWZkAbDja2ruS" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-on-crease.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 crease comparison with screens on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFKgVKgEBrWZkAbDja2ruS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 crease comparison with their screens on. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the thing everyone wants to know about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">when the foldable will be released</a>. If we use the Galaxy Z Fold 6 release window as a gauge, it's likely that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be revealed sometime around July 2025. Unless something changes, we can guess that Samsung will almost certainly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event around that time, where the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, and perhaps other products will be revealed.</p><p>As for price, it appears that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could bring along a price hike compared to the $1,899 Galaxy Z Fold 6. This might be attributed to the rumored new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip inside, which has a higher cost for manufacturers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold was released in Fall 2024 at a starting price of $1,799. You can get it in either 256GB or 512GB storage configurations, and in Porcelain or Obsidian colorways. We'll likely see more Pixel 9 Pro Fold deals and discounts as the phone gets older.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's design and displays are two areas of the smartphone that have been prominently leaked ahead of its official reveal. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, the image above is a CAD rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. While it might not look like a major visual departure from the Galaxy Z Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">there's more than meets the eye here</a>.</p><p>For starters, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to offer two new OLED panels that are bigger than those on the previous model. The main, foldable screen is said to be an 8.2-inch OLED panel this year, possibly of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless variant Samsung showed off at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>. On the outside, there is expected to be a 6.5-inch OLED cover screen.</p><p>It may also be the thinnest Samsung foldable ever, per the latest leaks and rumors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded, making it thinner than even the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which measures 150.2 x 155.2 x 5.1 mm.</p><p>It could also be a few grams lighter this year, with current estimations listing the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at 236 grams. That's significantly lighter than the 257-gram Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold features an 8-inch main screen by comparison. It's an OLED, LTPO panel supporting variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz. The panel is bright, supporting up to 2,700 nits peak brightness. On the outside, you get a similar 6.3-inch OLED cover screen, but this time with variable refresh rates ranging from 60 to 120Hz.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a sleek design with flat side rails and curved corners, whereas the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to retain its boxy, rectangular design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-closed-angled" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in its closed form, showcasing a slightly thinner form factor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="788" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the inside, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chipset</a> and 16GB of RAM. That's expected to be more memory than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will offer, as it is rumored to stick with 12GB. However, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is tipped to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> — possibly even a "for-Galaxy" variant. That should ensure that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 handily beats the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in gaming and general performance.</p>

<p>Current rumors predict that Samsung won't change the Galaxy Z Fold 7's charging or battery specifications, sticking with a 4,400mAh capacity. It'll also supposedly keep its 25W wired charging speed. Both figures are less than what the Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers, with 45W wired charging speeds and a 4,650mAh capacity.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first time in a while, Samsung is expected to upgrade the main camera sensor on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In all likelihood, it'll be the same 200MP main sensor found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> launched in China and Korea. It'll likely be joined by the same 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephoto lens as the current Galaxy Z Fold 6. The latter will enable 3x optical zoom.</p><p>How does that stack up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-saw-the-northern-lights-for-the-first-time-thanks-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras</a>? Google's foldable device offers a 48MP primary camera, paired with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. That telephoto lens notably offers 5x optical zoom, which is more than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to offer. While the 48MP primary camera may sound inferior to the 200MP camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, sensor size and other specifications will help determine which one is truly the best.</p>

The upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is said to include a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, bigger main and cover screens, and a new main camera sensor.</p><p>That could make it better equipped to beat the Pixel 9 Pro Fold than its predecessor.

<p>Samsung's foldable lineup has become known for its incremental upgrades, which don't amount to much from generation to generation. However, if you wait two or three years for upgrades to accumulate, a new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold device becomes significantly more appealing. So, how does the unreleased Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 factor into this pattern?</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung is expected to provide a few tangible upgrades that will make it a compelling foldable compared to prior models. Current rumors and leaks suggest that this generation will feature larger screens, a chip upgrade, and a new camera. That could make it an enticing upgrade for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> owners. Let's break down how these two models might compare in this early look.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-15.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs Fold 5 crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung typically hosts two Galaxy Unpacked events each year — one just after the new year and another in midsummer. The latter is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">where we expect to see the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 announced</a>, most likely in July 2025. Per recent leaks, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may arrive with a price hike compared to its predecessor, which retailed for $1,899.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a powerful but expensive processor, could be the reason for the rumored price increase. This would be a price hike beyond the raised prices announced last year with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The previous model, the Galaxy Z Fold 5, cost $1,799 in 2023.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 was available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage configurations, which are the same we expect to see on the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are expected to have a similar appearance, featuring a triple-camera system on the back. However, that's where the similarities end. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 may adopt the new, boxy and rectangular design introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It may also feature a redesigned hinge that closes completely flat, whereas the Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have a slight gap between the two displays when closed.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 also sports the narrower cover display, measuring 6.2 inches with a 1:9 aspect ratio. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to offer a wider 6.5-inch OLED panel. We can likely expect the Galaxy Z Fold 7's cover screen to match the specifications of recent Galaxy foldables, such as Dynamic AMOLED 2x and variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wAXQ3crVZZHAz2fr3Lk5DC" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-folded-in-tree.jpg" alt="Folded Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wAXQ3crVZZHAz2fr3Lk5DC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The outer display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is tipped to be larger, too. Current rumors indicate Samsung will add an 8.2-inch foldable OLED this year, and it's possible this display will have no visible crease. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">previewed a creaseless foldable display at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, but it has not been confirmed to arrive on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 only offers a 7.6-inch foldable screen.</p><p>According to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report, the image below represents a CAD rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 design. The foldable is set to measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded and weigh just 136 grams. These leaked dimensions indicate that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be significantly thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which measures 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6mm when unfolded and weighs 253 grams.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1405px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="bcSKm4AWGgRu9KjHXe5SxP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-front-back" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7's internal display, rear panel, and cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bcSKm4AWGgRu9KjHXe5SxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1405" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first time, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to be one of the first Samsung phones to ship with a new version of Android. It's said to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors">One UI 8</a>, which will be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. This is made possible due to Google's new rollout pace for Android, which sees new version upgrades released in the second quarter of each year.</p><p>The phone will reportedly be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, which brings overall improvements and superior AI processing. It's a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, which powers the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, current rumors predict that both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have the same battery capacity and charging speeds. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has a 4,400mAh capacity and can charge at up to 25W wired, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't expected to improve on those figures.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BvCPynz2thd8NNqdUtwdjC" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-in-tree.jpg" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvCPynz2thd8NNqdUtwdjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been notoriously complacent with its foldable cameras, but that's finally starting to change this year. The company is expected to swap the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in favor of a new 200MP sensor. Rumors suggest that the 200MP primary camera on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> — exclusively sold in China and Korea — will be introduced to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 globally.</p><p>It replaces the old 50MP primary camera sensor found on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Otherwise, the Galaxy Z Fold 7's camera hardware is rumored to be the same as the Galaxy Z Fold 5's lenses. That means both devices would have a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto lens with up to 3x optical zoom.</p><p>We haven't heard anything about Samsung changing up the front-facing cameras, so these will likely be the same 10MP cover camera and 4MP under-display camera we're familiar with on the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5-will-it-be-worth-the-wait-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5: Will it be worth the wait?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-closed-angled" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in its closed form, showcasing a slightly thinner form factor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="788" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For existing Galaxy Z Fold 5 owners, the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to bring along major changes that might be worth an upgrade. It may be significantly thinner and more durable, with advanced foldable display technologies, a better hinge, and dust resistance. The likely chip upgrade, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, and rumored 200MP primary camera round out the improved experience.</p><p>However, it's a tall ask to pay potentially more than $1,899 on a new phone just two years after investing $1,799 in a Galaxy Z Fold 5. That's even tougher when you consider that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are expected to have the same charging speeds and battery capacity. As such, it's far from a slam-dunk upgrade at the moment — but plenty can change ahead of Samsung's official announcement this summer.</p>

<ul><li>Google is collaborating with researchers at Georgia Tech and the Wild Dolphin Project to help them understand Dolphins better.</li><li>Dubbed DolphinGemma, the LLM is based off of Gemma— Google's open source language learning model.</li><li>DolphinGemma will wade through several audio files to understand sounds and clicks that these aquatic mammals make.</li><li>The improvised LLM will then identify patterns of communication and also predict what the dolphin might say next.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>If Dory can talk to a whale, then why can we bridge the gap of communication with real dolphins? Seems like Google and a group of scientists have been hard at work trying to make sense of the squeaks and clicks of these aquatic mammals.</p><p>For National Dolphin Day earlier this month, Google, in collaboration with researchers at Georgia Tech and the field research of the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP), has been working on training a large language learning model called DolphinGemma. This LLM is helping scientists study how dolphins communicate — and in the future, it could find out what they're saying, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V3NuAg7JosWzaA5UNV5Vf7" name="Dolphin-gemma" alt="DolphinGemma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V3NuAg7JosWzaA5UNV5Vf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/dolphingemma/">Keyword blog</a> states that the primary focus of WDP is observing and analyzing the dolphins' communication and social interactions. For instance, they have been able to correlate certain sounds with behaviors of these mammals. For instance, signature whistles (unique names) are usually used by mother dolphins to reunite with their young, while burst-pulse "squawks" are often seen during fights, and "Click buzzes" are often used during courtship or chasing sharks.</p><p>Where does the AI come in, you ask? Building on its open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Gemma</a> model, Google has created DolphinGemma, which is essentially an AI that processes audio that it receives.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8GdEVVvXyE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>WDP scientists have collected tons of acoustics of wild Atlantic spotted dolphins, and to help them interpret them better, these clicks and squawks are fed to the LLM.</p><p>After that, the AI model looks for patterns in these sounds. For instance, if a squawk is followed by two whistles, how often is the dolphin "communicating" that way? What's more is that once DolphinGemma understands these patterns, it will try to predict the sound that the dolphin might make next.</p><p>DolphinGemma is making it easier for scientists to spot these patterns, lessening the need for human intervention, which would essentially take longer. "The model can help researchers uncover hidden structures and potential meanings within the dolphins' natural communication," the post added.</p>

<p>After a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">messy March update rollout</a>, Google plans to finally merge Pixel Watch owners onto one late-April Wear OS 5.1 versuib — and remove a key feature from Wear OS that isn't working as intended.</p><p>The March Pixel Watch update added several new features, including a new "enhanced step count algorithm" designed to better track steps in "challenging situations" like using a walking stick, stroller, shopping cart, or wheelchair.</p><p>Unfortunately, it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">triggered several bugs</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> units like delayed notifications, battery drain, and artificially inflated step counts for some users. And many Pixel Watch owners never received it.</p><p>In early April, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-pixel-watch-models">pushed an update</a> to fix the battery and notification issues; now, this latest update, "BP1A.250305.019.W8," will fix the step-counting issue by returning to the old algorithm.</p>

<p>People stuck on the old November 2024 patch will receive the <em>other</em> March 2025 features: menstrual tracking in Fitbit, a media controls upgrade, new dev tools, some UI changes, auto bed-time mode on the Pixel Watch 2, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch/2025/2025-03-01">high-severity security fixes</a>. Only the step count algorithm algorithm is excluded.</p><p>Google promises that you'll receive a smartwatch notification when the update becomes available. If you want to check for it now, put your Pixel Watch on a charger, go to Settings > System > System Update, and rapidly tap the screen for about 15–30 seconds to see if the update appears.</p><p>Based on past Pixel Watch update rollouts, older models or LTE models will take longer to receive this April 2025 Wear OS patch.</p>

<p>Ironically, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">tested the enhanced step count algorithm</a> on my Pixel Watch 3 last week. I knew Wear OS 5.1 had caused some bugs, but didn't know that people's watches were adding tens of thousands of steps or tracking movement while removed.</p><p>Despite my ignorance, I approached my test with some skepticism about whether Google's "exceptional accuracy" claim was true, and I put it through some tough tests.</p><p>My results weren't perfect, but in every scenario, my step count was <em>below</em> the actual step count. It was 100 steps short after 10,000 steps, 143 steps short after hiking up hills with a trekking pole, and a couple hundred steps short while walking through a store with a shopping cart.</p><p>My takeaway was that the algorithm had room to grow, but that it did a decent job of recognizing abnormal step movements, better than other brands that can only interpret natural arm swings as steps. And I appreciated that Google was trying to account for scenarios like pushing a wheelchair, stroller, or walker, not just able-bodied athletes.</p><p>That's why I find it a shame that Google has reverted to the old algorithm, which we've typically found to be less accurate for <em>normal</em> step tracking. I asked my Google rep about what "certain scenarios" were causing issues and why the algorithm had to be reverted rather than fixed; I'll update this post if I hear back.</p><p>Hopefully, they'll be able to re-add the enhanced algorithm in the future, resolving the source of the false-positive steps while still helping Pixel Watches to recognize unorthodox steps and movement.</p>

<p>While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn't bring major upgrades over its predecessor, there's a chance that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 might be a different story. We expect Samsung to release its next big-screen foldable sometime this summer, and leaks and rumors shed light on the upgrades set to arrive.</p><p>But will the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> be a worthwhile upgrade over the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>? There may be enough changes to warrant an upgrade, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 expected to feature a chip upgrade, a new camera sensor, and larger displays. However, the price might make it cost-prohibitive to purchase. Let's break down how these two devices will shake up in this early, speculative comparison.</p>

<p>Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, we're expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to be officially revealed</a> at a Galaxy Unpacked event sometime this summer. It could be in July 2025, which tracks with past Galaxy Z Fold releases. According to the latest predictions, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could cost more than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is priced at $1,899. The price hike could be a result of the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Currently, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starting at $1,899, with three different storage configurations available: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. It's available in Silver, Shadow, Pink, and Navy colorways.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-closed-angled" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in its closed form, showcasing a slightly thinner form factor." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtyCmJKLo7RwHmMt2AotPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="788" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the leaked CAD renderings for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>), you might not notice a ton of changes compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Samsung appears to be retaining a similar design language, with flat sides and sharp corners. That said, while the rear camera arrangement looks similar, virtually everything else is different.</p><p>The differences start with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 allegedly offering a much thinner profile than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The foldable phone will reportedly measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded, making it the thinnest Samsung foldable to date. While not thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>, it could be the thinnest foldable in the U.S. It may also be slightly lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, weighing in at 236g.</p><p>Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which measures 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be a considerable improvement.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V542e3d8XE6pnuayyneDpk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V542e3d8XE6pnuayyneDpk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The upgrades don't stop there. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to ship with a bigger main screen and cover screen. The foldable, inner panel is rumored to grow to 8.2 inches this year, and it's possible that it has a creaseless look, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">the version previewed by Samsung at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>. On the outside, the cover screen will apparently be a 6.5-inch panel.</p><p>While we don't know the exact specifications of the displays yet, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 might give us some idea. The current model sports a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x inner display with a variable refresh rate between 1 and 120Hz. On the outside, there's a 6.3-inch cover screen with the same specs, but higher pixel density. It's likely that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will retain many of these specifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GF3QPWY4hxvMrmFA36Ljkk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GF3QPWY4hxvMrmFA36Ljkk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung is also expected to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's newest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> to the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This upgraded processor is capable of handling more demanding AI tasks and features Qualcomm's best custom Oryon cores. It'll be superior to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip inside the current Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the phone is rumored to have the same 12GB of available memory.</p><p>Despite the delays associated with Samsung's One UI 7 rollout, current rumors point to Samsung launching the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a>, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>.</p>

<p>The battery and charging specs appear to be unchanged, with Samsung unlikely to make changes between models. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to feature the same 4,400mAh capacity and 25W wired charging speeds. It's an underwhelming part of the Galaxy Z Fold 7's rumored specs for people hoping for faster charging and longer battery life.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zUEBcjrcBUJwjP9dX5hD2n" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Camera open on Galaxy Z Fold 6 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zUEBcjrcBUJwjP9dX5hD2n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the past few generations, Samsung hasn't upgraded the camera system on the Galaxy Z Fold product line, aside from the Special Edition model. As of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 generation, the camera system still includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. However, this appears to finally be changing with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>Current rumors suggest that Samsung will utilize a 200MP main sensor on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which could be the same sensor found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> — a premium variant exclusive to China and Korea. The other sensors are said to be unchanged, though, still remaining as a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto. This is an improvement, but the secondary lenses still leave something to be desired.</p><p>There are no leaks or rumors suggesting the front-facing cameras will change, either. They'll likely remain a 10MP sensor for the cover display and a 4MP under-display lens for the folding display.</p>

<p>With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumored to cost even more than the pricey Galaxy Z Fold 6, it probably won't make sense to upgrade if you already have the current model. That being said, users of earlier Galaxy Z Fold models — or those trying to buy a Samsung foldable for the first time — might be pleased by the Galaxy Z Fold 7's rumored upgrades.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that when the Galaxy Z Fold 7 officially releases, it's possible that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will become massively discounted. As such, if you're willing to compromise a bit, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could offer a better value proposition than the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7. Until Samsung officially debuts the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it's impossible to know the exact details.</p>

<p>In its usual Nothing way of things, the company dropped several social media posts showing off its upcoming CMF Phone Pro 2. For the past few days, Nothing has been teasing the phone, first giving us a close-up of the device's cameras, then the pictures it can click, the way the phone feels, and more.</p><p>Today, it released a video showcasing the phone from all angles, featuring the tagline "Playful and Powerful." As for the design,  the phone looks much like its predecessor; however, it comes with a powerful camera setup.</p><p>The company stated in its community forum that the phone is redesigned inside and out. As for the exterior, the CMF Phone Pro 2 features rounded corners and a triple camera array on its rear panel, accompanied by an LED flash positioned below the third lens, located off to the side. The camera lens appears to be encased in metallic rims, adding definition to its camera array.</p>

<ul><li>Lenovo has started teasing its Legion Tab (4th-gen) for consumers on Weibo, which confirms an 8.8-inch display, single-rear camera, and AI software.</li><li>Another teaser highlighted Lenovo's focus on making the next tablet even "thinner" and "lighter."</li><li>The company's AI for the next Legion Tab could focus on gaming, which was a strong focus for the 3rd-generation when it launched in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Lenovo is already teasing its next-gen small tablet on social media, which is shaping up to be thin and loaded with new features.</p><p>The company posted a couple of teasers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://h5.video.weibo.com/show/1034:5156720561815570">on Weibo</a> (Chinese), which involve a short video clip and a poster about its form factor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/lenovo-legion-tab-y700-gen-4-ai-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). Lenovo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5981912323/PofI451QY">image teaser</a> reportedly states its upcoming Legion Tab (4th Gen) will be "thinner" than its previous iteration and "lighter."</p><p>Specifics on both of these important specs are sitll unknown; however, Lenovo dives deeper into what consumers can expect in its video clip.</p><p>The highlight of the Legion Tab is its small form, which is how the video begins: showing a model pulling the tablet out of their pocket like a phone. The clip shows it in hand and an apparent single-camera lens on its back panel. The video also confirms the 4th-gen Legion Tab will feature an 8.8-inch display.</p><p>Lenovo teases AI software for its Legion Tab, too. The publication states its teaser highlights an upcoming feature dubbed "AI combat support." The running theory is that this could concern an assistant for mobile games like PUBG or League of Legends: Wild Rift.</p><p>That's unconfirmed at the moment in the teasers. The company then reportedly alluded to an upgrade in its SoC — and it seems Lenovo is sticking with flagship quality. The Chinese teaser suggests a "new Qualcomm" chip will enter the tablet, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>Rumors claim the next Legion Tab could launch in May (Chinese market first), and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/17/lenovo-legion-tab-2025-screen-battery-upgrades-report/">recent leak</a> speaks of its power supply. A prominent Weibo tipster suggested the tablet could pack a battery between 7,000mAh and 8,000mAh.</p><p>There are a few things that appear similar between the 4th and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">3rd-gen Legion Tab</a>, which debuted back in January. First, the 8.8-inch display seems to live once again for the tablet while a single-rear camera was spotted, too. The latest tablet offered a 13MP camera. It seems likely we'd see that again, but we'll have to wait for more information. The battery of the 3rd-gen is also smaller than what we've seen rumored for the 4th-gen.</p><p>Lenovo's January launch offers a 6,500mAh battery with 45W fast charging. While we <em>could </em>see an expanded capacity, its charging remains unknown.</p><p>Moreover, gaming was a cornerstone with the last tablet, and Lenovo seems poised to focus on that aspect once more. The 3rd-gen tablet offers the Legion Coldfront Vapor Chamber for the influx of heat it generates during longer gaming sessions. This vapor chamber was said to enable gamers to go longer without worry. If Lenovo is looking to pack AI features, the next Legion Tab could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">quite the secondary option</a> for tablet gamers.</p>

<p>For a flat pad, Belkin has made a comeback in the wireless charging space over the last year, with a variety of 10W and 15W wireless chargers that are Made for Google. They support the EPP charging profile used by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> and previous models, while also maintaining wireless charging profiles like those used by Samsung and Apple for their phones.</p><p>The Belkin 2-in-1 wireless charging pad features Qi2 15W charging technology and can charge both your Samsung and iPhone. Also, the 5W Qi pad can charge your AirPods at the same time.</p><p>The iOttie iON Wireless Duo is another good option, especially if you charge your true wireless earbuds next to your phone whenever possible. This stand supports 15W EPP charging to Pixel phones, and the design and texture are wonderfully premium for an entirely reasonable price.</p><p>The Anker MagSafe Charger Pad is an affordable and compact wireless charger that comes with a cable built in, so it's a clever and versatile little charger. You can use the latest charging technology to charge your iPhone. While this model is made specifically for iPhone, other chargers fall into the category of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones" target="_blank">best MagSafe accessories for Android</a>.</p><p>If you plan to use your wireless charger on the go, we recommend getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-qi-wireless-charging-power-banks">best Qi wireless portable chargers</a> in addition to a larger wireless charging pad or stand.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-to-take-note-of-before-buying-a-wireless-charger-2">Some things to take note of before buying a wireless charger</h2>
<p>Wireless chargers have a dozen different charging standards and protocols that are hard to condense down to a product name or a bullet-pointed list. Still, we've tried to sum up the most important things to know right here.</p><p>Let's start with the most important standards on a Qi charger, the actual charging specs:</p>
<ul><li><strong>15W EPP</strong>: This is the Qi Wireless Consortium's "Extended Power Profile," and it's a relatively open standard, the list of compatible phones continues to grow, including LG phones, the Google Pixel 5 and up, and the OnePlus 8 Pro and up (when not using OnePlus's charger for proprietary 30W or higher wireless charging).</li><li><strong>15W Samsung</strong>: This is technically the Samsung Fast Charge Wireless 2.0, and while still limited, there are some chargers with this speed specification outside of Samsung's own 15W Wireless Charger Stand.</li><li><strong>10W Qi</strong>: Of the 10W charging specs, the standard 10W is what most chargers and Android support. This can sometimes be using the EPP profile, sometimes it's not, and sometimes it's not the standard Qi because it's the Samsung profile instead.</li><li><strong>10W Samsung</strong>: This is technically Samsung Fast Charge 1.0, and for many wireless chargers, it's the 10W standard they refer to when they say they're a 10W charger. The charging speed you'll see on a compatible Samsung device is closer to 9W than 10W.</li><li><strong>7.5W Apple</strong>: 7.5W is the charging speed used for iPhones, and as such, it is now a standard charging speed offered on almost all wireless chargers. Wondering where the 15W Apple charging is? It's currently limited to first-party Apple chargers.</li><li><strong>5W Qi</strong>: This is the basic Qi profile that all Qi chargers are compatible with. Even if you can't fast-charge your phone with a specific charger, you can always get 5W charging if your device supports Qi charging.</li></ul>
<p>Since we haven't yet found a wireless charger that supports all of these, we have to try to pick a charger that meets the particular standards our devices can use now and in the future. If you're a Galaxy or iPhone user, your task is easy, since most chargers have your protocols. The rest of us should look for a charger with 15W EPP or 10W standard Qi charging.</p>

<p>After having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shows-off-the-oneplus-13t">sneak peek</a> at the OnePlus 13T last week — thanks to the teaser from the company — new information now reveals the upcoming flagship’s giant battery capacity.</p><p>According to OnePlus through its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/3871046669/PofsUshDh">Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13T-Company-confirms-large-sized-battery-with-bypass-charging-support.1002535.0.html">Notebookcheck</a>) and its Chinese <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opposhop.cn/cn/web/products/33886.html?wake_app=0&utm_campaign=oneplus13t&_tf_code=1909082230753206272&wake=miniprogram&utm_medium=banner&utm_source=oneplusguanwang">website listing</a>, OnePlus will be featuring a massive 6260 mAh battery capacity. It is even bigger than its siblings — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">13R</a>, which each have a 6000 mAh battery.</p>

<p>While having gigantic batteries isn't new to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, the OnePlus seems to be achieving it in a rather compact form factor with the OnePlus 13T. The compactness comes from its 6.3-inch screen, lighter design, as the upcoming handset will weigh only 185 grams. Small-screen phones until now have not been so battery efficient, which was a major turn-off for those who preferred <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact phones</a>.</p><p>It appears that shouldn't be the case with the OnePlus 13T as it is coming with a sizable battery. All thanks to OnePlus' proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery technology</a>, which was announced by the company last June. For the unaware, it is built upon the silicon carbon anode battery technology co-developed by OnePlus and Ningde New Energy — and tailored for high-performance phones.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13T is taking a good shape as it is going to be as compact as it can — and operating the device with one hand should be hassle-free. Alongside the massive battery, the device is also confirmed to be shipping with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset and ColorOS out of the box. The upcoming handset is likely to have a matte finish and three possible wcolorways — Black, Pink, and Silver.</p><p>The device will feature rounded corners, and a new camera visor is seen from the teaser, which differs significantly from its other OnePlus 13 siblings. And, it incorporates dual camera lenses accompanied by a flash. OnePlus already confirmed that its popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">Alert Slider</a> is going away in favor of a new customizable button, and the OnePlus 13T could be the first one to incorporate it.</p><p>Lastly, the launch is just around the corner, as OnePlus is launching the handset in China on April 24.</p>

<p><em><strong>Lev asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Jerry I appreciate the ways to save money that you share and I have a question. I need a phone and was thinking about buying used. Is there anything special i should know or need to look out for?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Heyo Lev! It's great to hear from someone else who likes to be a little frugal; that can be tough if you're a tech enthusiast.</p><p>This is an awesome question because yes, there are a few extra steps you should take if you're buying a used phone, especially if you're buying it through a private sale via online classifieds or eBay. Getting a great piece of equipment at a good price is important, but knowing how to keep from getting ripped off is even more important.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-refurbished-phone">Buying a used phone</a> gives you access to high-end devices and features without paying the early adopter tax. It's also more eco-friendly, if that's your thing, and it avoids the instant depreciation a phone experiences once it's sold. Phones are a lot like cars and are worth significantly less as soon as you've bought one.</p><p>Sadly, people are people, and there are folks out there trying to move their junk to you and your money to them. Here are a few things you can do to prevent it.</p>
<h2 id="do-these-things-first-2">Do these things first</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.75%;"><img id="Cfgow9hz7KYu2AWCxj7DZ8" name="ebay-san-jose-hq.jpg" alt="eBay San Jose HQ" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cfgow9hz7KYu2AWCxj7DZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="558" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: eBay)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Look at a reputable seller first</strong>. There's a very good chance that a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us" target="_blank">Back Market</a> will have the phone you want. You also might be able to buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-certified-re-newed">recertified</a> from the manufacturer or on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17871142011" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. It may cost a little more, but buying from a place you can 100% trust can be worth a few dollars.</p><p><strong>Understand any return policy</strong>. A private party sale probably won't have any sort of return policy, but other ways to shop might. Make sure you know what that policy is and how it works before any money changes hands.</p><p><strong>Ask questions</strong>. Make sure the photos you see are of the actual device for sale. Ask if there has been any exposure to liquid or third-party repairs. Anything you can think of, just ask. You might feel like a pest, but if a seller wants your money, they can put up with a few questions.</p><p><strong>Check the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-imei-number-your-phone"><strong>IMEI/ESN</strong></a>. <em>Especially</em> for any private sales. You can use these numbers to make sure the phone isn't blacklisted due to non-payment, reported lost, or even worse, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">stolen device</a>. Call your carrier with the number, and they will run a check for you before you buy anything.</p><p><strong>Ask for a photo showing the phone being charged</strong>. Ideally, make sure today's date is shown, too. This lets you know the port isn't broken or the battery hasn't gone squirrelly.</p>
<p>Don't feel like any of this is you asking too much. You're about to spend a good bit on money and there are some answers you need to make sure this is the right phone to buy. Anyone selling a phone should understand.</p>
<h2 id="other-things-to-keep-in-mind-2">Other things to keep in mind</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7u6Y4S28aV7Je6tehARRRk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-battery-chart" alt="A battery usage chart on the Google Pixel 9a, showing the progression of battery life across a few days." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7u6Y4S28aV7Je6tehARRRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Saving money is sweet, but there are a few downsides to buying a used phone. Some are obvious, like it will have a shorter update and customer care period because it's already a bit older. Others aren't as obvious.</p><p>There is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">wear on the battery</a>. I always talk about the battery in a phone, and that's because it's what goes bad first. Unless you damage something, the reason you stop using an old phone will be the battery. The battery starts to degrade the first time the phone is powered on and cannot be improved. This matters because the person who had it before you might have used the dickens out of it, and there could be more wear and tear on the battery than you realize.</p><p>Be prepared for some cosmetic imperfections. The glass will be covered with tiny scratches you can't see, but there may be some you can. Don't buy a phone with obvious mechanical damage, but know that even one that looks perfect probably isn't.</p><p>With these two things in mind, I suggest you <em><strong>never</strong></em> buy a used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a>. It's damn near impossible to change the battery, meaning only the company who made it can do it and they love to charge out of warranty prices whenever they can. Wear and tear also means something different for foldables because those tiny scratches on the glass cause stress that leads to breaks and fractures near the hinge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUPtiQZW2BKhoTBaMEUdWQ" name="samsung-motorola-razr-plus-2023-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Green line of death on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUPtiQZW2BKhoTBaMEUdWQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Companies making foldables are working on making things better, but today I would suggest you only buy your foldables new — <strong>with a warranty</strong> — from the manufacturer or your phone carrier.</p><p>None of this should scare you away from buying a used phone, because the positives outweigh the negatives. Spending half as much to get what was touted as the very pinnacle of tech just last year sounds like a good idea to me!</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want an affordable smartphone with a stunning AMOLED display, great cameras, and multiple days of battery life. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;d prefer a midrange phone from Google or Samsung; you need a device with wireless charging or all the latest AI software features.</p><p>A direct challenger to Google&apos;s new Pixel 9a, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> packs a ton of flagship-level specs into a stylish, midrange package.

The OnePlus 13R isn&apos;t jam-packed with all of the latest AI software features, and you&apos;re missing out on wireless charging and seven years of OS upgrades. But if you&apos;re simply looking for an affordable Android phone that&apos;s good at, well, being a phone, then the OnePlus 13R is one of the best options around.</p>

<p>Google is responding to the U.S. federal court's ruling from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ad-tech-space-monopoly-antitrust-us-judge-violation"> last week </a>(April 17), which stated that Alphabet, Google's parent company, violates antitrust laws in the ad-tech space. It states that this ruling will not only affect Google as a company, but would "hurt America’s consumers, economy, and technological leadership."</p><p>Leonie Brinkema, a U.S. district judge, issued a ruling stating that Google's parent company had illegally monopolized the online advertising space. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-partially-loses-us-advertising-tech-antitrust-case" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> brought the ruling to light, noting that this violation pertains to "advertising exchanges and tools used by websites to sell ad space." The judge also states that Google isn't allowing other companies to enter the ad space, let alone compete with them.</p><p>By stating that, the company "willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets."</p>

<p>Google outlines several points in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-apr-2025/">Keyword blog</a> regarding how this judgment would negatively impact the company as it competes with AI technologies like ChatGPT, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek" target="_blank">DeepSeek</a>, and others.</p><p>To start, Google states that this judgment would force phones and browsers to use alternative search engines, such as Bing and Yahoo!, making it more difficult for users to access Google Search, despite it being their primary option.</p><p>Secondly, the government aims to prevent Google from paying phones or browsers, such as Mozilla, to maintain Search as the default search engine. Google claims that this move will exacerbate the situation for users, as companies may start charging customers to compensate for the revenue loss resulting from Google's actions.</p><p>Additionally, Google states that the Department of Justice (DOJ)'s proposal will also require them to share user information with unknown companies, which could, in turn, jeopardize users' privacy and safety. The DOJ has also asked Google to separate Chrome from Android and wants the company to sell Chrome. It also suggested splitting Android from Google Search and Play without forcing a sell-off.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Google states that this move could disrupt the platforms they've built over the years and offered to users for free, harm businesses built on them, and compromise security. For instance, splitting it off would disrupt its integration with other Google services within Chrome.</p><p>Lastly, the company says it would also "hamstring how we develop AI, and have a government-appointed committee regulate the design and development of our products.</p><p>The Justice Department and a group of states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/doj-lawsuit-google-ad-business">sued Google in 2023</a>, arguing the company monopolized three display advertising markets online: ad servers, exchanges, and networks. As of now, Google says it disagrees with the decision and will appeal to the court to look for ways to mitigate this judgment.</p><p>The new trial for Google to prove that it isn't in violation of these antitrust laws begins today (Apr. 21). And if Google ends up losing its plea, it could drastically change the way users interact with Google and its products in the future.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is busy rolling out its latest Android Auto update; however, previous glimpses of an intriguing new feature have reportedly vanished.</p><p>The update was spotted rolling out earlier today (Apr. 21) by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/android-auto-14-2-rolling-out-glasses-removal/">9to5Google</a> for Android Auto drivers as version 14.2. The patch doesn't appear to be substantial, nor does it feature any noteworthy features for drivers to enjoy. The publication states v14.2 only offers "bug fixes and other minor tweaks," so it seems Google is keeping things lighthearted in mid-April.</p><p>However, what is noteworthy is the supposed removal of a previously discovered (and once assumed) feature in development.</p><p>The post says Google has removed all mentions of "Glasses" within Android Auto's code as v14.2 rolls out. It conducted another teardown of its APK, which discovered a lack of its previous barebones code. Speculation says there may have been a few "alternate translation" issues with the code that could've forced the idea of "Glasses" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>.</p><p>With things still woefully unclear, it'll be worth playing things by ear and seeing if this feature surfaces again in the future.</p>

<p>If you missed it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-smart-glasses-integration-code-rumors">there were rumors</a> that Google was developing a smart glasses-based feature for Android Auto. Leveraged from the Hindi version of the app, a tipster found two strings that mention "Glasses" and the ability to "start navigation to launch Glasses." However, the way the strings are mentioned, as highlighted by 9to5, could point toward that "alternate translation" issue.</p><p>Its post states the English version didn't match with what was found in the overseas version. So, while it doesn't seem like Google is working on smart glasses integration, maybe there's a future where this changes.</p><p>Nothing else was found in that teardown earlier this month. What we were able to chew on was Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 demo</a>, which was all about its Android XR ambitions. At its core, the demo featured the company's "memory" feature for smart glasses. With them on, the glasses were recording and making mental notes about the placements of items. This is for the betterment of its rediscovery capabilities.</p><p>If you lost something, users could ask Gemini where it is, like "Where did I leave my hotel room key?" In the demo, the AI was able to inform the user where their key card is through descriptors and items around it to help them.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/the-fourth-beta-of-android-16.html" target="_blank">latest update</a> drop didn’t really spill much about what’s new under the hood. And since we’re this close to the stable release—likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">lining up with Google I/O in May</a>—it’s safe to say we’re not expecting any big surprises. This build is probably just about tightening screws, squashing bugs, and making sure everything runs smooth for launch day.</p><p>Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, locking down two stealthy bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. Google has also dropped the factory images for those who like the manual route, and the OTA rollout is already underway (look for build BP22.250325.007).</p>
<h2 id="bug-hunt-wins-2">Bug hunt wins</h2>
<p>Android 16 Beta 4’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta4" target="_blank">official notes</a> reveal fixes for some pretty key bugs, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">weird battery drain</a>, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also squashes system stability issues and random launcher crashes some folks were dealing with.</p><p>Additionally, a few Pixel users have taken to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1k1phxe/android_16_beta_4/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-16-beta-4-quietly-removes-small-useful-pixel-feature/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>

<p>If you’ve got a Pixel, from the 6 series all the way up to the new 9 lineup (including Fold, Tablet, and A models), you’re good to go with the Android 16 Beta 4 update.</p><p>A big highlight in this release is the first-ever beta build for the freshly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, which is now part of the Android Beta Program’s device lineup.</p><p>Google is sticking to its Q2 2025 launch plan and letting beta testers know they’ll get automatic OTA update notifications once it’s ready to roll.</p>
<h2 id="beta-goes-global-2">Beta goes global</h2>
<p>Following in the footsteps of OnePlus and Xiaomi, Google is opening up the Android 16 beta to even more brands. Now, iQoo, Lenovo, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Vivo, and Honor devices are also getting in on the pre-release action.</p><p>To check if Android 16 Beta 4 is ready for your Pixel, head to Settings > System > Software updates, then tap "System update." From there, hit "Check for updates" to see if it's available.</p>

<ul><li>With Hybring Reasoning, developers can enable or disable the 'thinking' process, maintaining speed while improving accuracy.</li><li>The new Gemini model claims to be faster and more cost-effective than previous versions.</li><li>Gemini 2.5 Flash also outperforms competing AI models in benchmark tests across various tasks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Late last week, Google shared that it is releasing the Gemini 2.5 Flash — a new version of the Gemini AI model. It highlights the hybrid reasoning capability, which further allows developers to control the level of reasoning applied to a given prompt.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">announcement post</a>, Google notes that developers can now start building with the new Gemini 2.5 Flash model, which is also a faster and cheaper model. It is released in preview through the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to being cost-effective, the new model is also a low-latency thinking model that is reasonably priced, particularly considering its solid benchmarks. This is because the new model is based on the popular foundation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0</a> Flash.</p><p>As mentioned, it is a hybrid model, which allows developers to turn on thinking or disable it. Despite disabling it, the company promises that it can still maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash and simultaneously improve performance.</p><p>As for the thinking model, the Gemini 2.5 models are capable of reasoning before responding. This means it doesn’t immediately generate an output; “the model can perform a ‘thinking’ process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response.” The complex tasks here can include solving math problems or analyzing research questions. The thinking process claims to allow the model to give more accurate and comprehensive answers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:490px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:122.45%;"><img id="vMKWxwQZeEkt2HbDt5dAoe" name="Gemini-2-dot-5-flash-benchmark-test" alt="Gemini 2.5 Flash benchmark" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMKWxwQZeEkt2HbDt5dAoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="490" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google has also shared the Gemini 2.5 Flash model’s benchmark tests in comparison with some of the competition, which includes tasks based on mathematics, science, code generation, code editing, and visual reasoning — and does outperform the rival AI models.</p><p>Other than the developers taking advantage of the new Gemini 2.5 Flash, regular consumers can also try it out in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>, alongside Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental models, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">were unveiled</a> in February this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Having an external SSD is highly convenient when traveling, and as I started going back to events in 2025, I collated all the drives I have to see which would be best. There's been a steady rise in stick SSD drives in recent years; I used SK Hynix's Tube T31 last year, and it was pretty great — while it looks identical a regular USB drive, it houses an SSD inside, and is able to deliver 1000MB/s transfers. <br><br>But the drive I ended up using the most over the course of 2025 is TeamGroup's X1 Max. TeamGroup debuted the drive in Q2 2024, and the SSD is now available globally. The base 256GB model costs $28 on Amazon, and the 512GB variant is $53 as of writing. The model I tested is the 1TB version, and that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Interface-Compatible-Smartphone-TX1MAX3256GB01/dp/B0D3HBPJWT">available for $73 on Amazon</a>. By contrast, Samsung's T7 Portable — the best-selling external SSD by some margin — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8">costs $99</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ou3ysqmGgSnddc2USrUVme" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ou3ysqmGgSnddc2USrUVme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The distinctive design feature of the X1 Max is that it looks like a regular flash drive. SK Hynix's Tube T31 is noticeably bigger and bulkier than the X1 Max, and there's just no way to tell by looking at the X1 Max that you're getting a 1TB SSD; TeamGroup deserves a lot of credit for the sleek design of the SSD.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJLdrZZGaTc3W3fiDkzRne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJLdrZZGaTc3W3fiDkzRne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another thing the brand nailed is the connectivity; the X1 Max has the standard USB-A connector at one end, but you also get a USB-C port on the other side, giving it much better versatility. This was an annoyance on the Tube T31, but there are no problems in this regard with the X1 Max; in the four months I had the drive, I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and an assortment of Windows devices including my gaming rig.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CTYmc5JBvyUYckeSgLake" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CTYmc5JBvyUYckeSgLake.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In all that time, I didn't have any issues whatsoever with the drive, and it's this versatility that makes the X1 Max stand out, and why I use it as my to-go external drive while traveling. It's significantly smaller than other external SSDs, and the fact that you can just plug it in to any device without having to use a cable makes it highly convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sgy3DeBT8zAyrSvz5x9Tme" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sgy3DeBT8zAyrSvz5x9Tme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Measuring 6.3cm and coming in at just 12g, the X1 Max is small and light enough that you can take anywhere, and portability is not an issue. If anything, I had to leave it in a side pocket on my bag so it wouldn't get lost. The shell itself is made out of aluminum, and the connectors on either end get a plastic cap to protect against dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCrSKNnGt6WAngKqByyNoe" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCrSKNnGt6WAngKqByyNoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive gets up to 1000MB/s when reading data, and it is able to hit 900MB/s during writes. I had no problems moving hundreds of gigabytes of photos and videos from phones, documents and other vital data from my Windows devices, and assorted multimedia to and from phones and tablets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ux9hvQpCfyWxvpxMd24Qne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux9hvQpCfyWxvpxMd24Qne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only quibble is that the drive gets hot during extended transfer sessions; this is often the case with most external SSDs, and while TeamGroup says the X1 Max uses an aluminum alloy cooling solution to deliver better thermals, it's still quite hot. The write cache is quite limited, so if you're transferring over 40GB of data at once, you will see a decline in the bandwidth. This isn't an issue most of the time, but it was slightly slower than other stick SSDs I tested when transferring videos out of my phone.</p>
<p>There's no bundled software either, and you miss out on password protection, so if you need to safeguard sensitive data, you'll need to use a custom solution. The X1 Max uses the USB 3.2 Gen2 x1 standard, and I didn't see any problems getting the drive to connect to just about any platform. Honestly, it's for this reason that I used the X1 Max so much in 2025, and having traveled to four countries and using the drive extensively, it still looks pristine — I have no doubt that this thing is built to last.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fGsftAiqVEppYuTevt3yne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fGsftAiqVEppYuTevt3yne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, that's why I like the X1 Max over similar options that are starting to become available. It's light enough that you don't even notice it, has both USB-C and USB-A connectors, and does a reliable job connecting to phones, tablets, Windows, macOS devices, handheld consoles like the Steam Deck, and just about anything else. It's also a solid value if you're interested in getting the 1TB variant, and</p>

To give you some context, last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> is still one of the best camera phones around, and the combination of a 1-inch lens along with exquisite tuning continue to give the device a distinct edge. <br><br>Thankfully, there's no need to wait any longer, as Vivo has just unveiled the X200 Ultra in China. What's of particular interest is that the device has two imaging chips — the VS1  and V3+ — with the VS1 handling "preliminary optimization of raw data" to optimize image quality and the V3+ doing the usual "postprocessing tasks".</p>

<p>Video is getting a boost as well, with Vivo introducing what it calls Multi-Focal Portrait Video Master. The X200 Ultra is slated to deliver movie-like videos, and the device handles 4K60 10bit Log along with 4K120 footage. Interestingly, Vivo is debuting a Photographer Kit accessor this time that includes a ZEISS 2.35x Telephoto Converter, camera grip, and bundled case. <br><br>Xiaomi has a habit of doing the same with its phones, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> has a gorgeous red kit that's great to use. But with Vivo including an external lens with its package, I'm keen on seeing what it has to offer. I'll be getting my hands on the X200 Ultra and the external lens, and will share my findings in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Continuing with the camera, the X200 Ultra doesn't have a 1-inch main camera any longer, but it has a 50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony LYT818 sensor, and it should be just as good as the X200 Pro. It retains the 200MP HP9 module that goes up to 3.7x, and you get a 50MP wide-angle that also uses the Sony LYT818 sensor. <br><br>Switching over to the hardware, Vivo is using Qualcomm silicon once again, and like the best phones of 2025, you get the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The device has 16GB of RAM as standard, and comes with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage models. It has a 6.82-inch panel with QHD resolution, 2160Hz PWM dimming, and a 6000mAh battery with 90W charging tech. <br><br>Similar to last year, the X200 Ultra isn't going to debut outside China, and that's annoying when you consider the caliber of the cameras. Still, the X200 Pro is a decent enough alternative if you need something similar, and having switched back to the device, it is easily among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones of the year</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>After rolling out Gemini Live’s real-time video and screen sharing support to Gemini Advanced subscribers late last month, Google is now expanding it to all Android users.</p><p>Google first showcased these Project Astra-based features at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona</a> this year, with the rollout starting by the end of March. It was officially introduced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> devices, and followed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-rolling-out-video-and-screen-sharing-support-for-gemini-live">Gemini Advanced users</a>. Now, it is available for regular users without the Advanced subscription that Gemini offers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/16/gemini-live-camera-free/">9to5Google</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 It’s here: ask Gemini about anything you see. Share your screen or camera in Gemini Live to brainstorm, troubleshoot, and more.Rolling out to Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices today and available for all Advanced users on @Android in the Gemini app:… pic.twitter.com/fjTD4qhvjz<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1909215393186472380">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The feature that lets users talk live to Gemini about anything they see either on their phone’s screen or device’s camera, and is pretty easy to launch. Users have to trigger Gemini as they normally do, and when the “Ask Gemini” window pops up, there will be a new clickable short window dubbed “Share screen with Live” right above it. Hitting this will allow Gemini to look at the screen while users still talk to it.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o6I2O9hvzMY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Users can showcase their device’s camera or scroll through any app while talking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a>, which responds to their queries based on what they are seeing on the screen. Similar to live screen recording notifications in the notification pane, there’s a Gemini Live screen sharing too, through which users can stop sharing their screen per their requirements.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve been hearing great feedback on Gemini Live with camera and screen share, so we decided to bring it to more people ✨Starting today and over the coming weeks, we're rolling it out to *all* @Android users with the Gemini app. Enjoy!PS If you don’t have the app yet,… https://t.co/dTsxLZLxNI<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1912591827087315323">April 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Additionally, it lets users organize their spaces, brainstorm creative projects, troubleshoot and get input, get personal shopping advice, and develop their skills and get feedback, notes Google in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-android-tips/">announcement post</a> from last month.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google not putting its advanced features behind a paywall and making it free for all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users. And for users who are concerned about their audio, video, and screen shares to Gemini and being stored, they can set up auto-delete functionality via Gemini Apps Activity through their Google account settings.</p>

<p>This week, I wore augmented reality glasses that showed my pace, heart rate, power, and other stats in the corner of my vision while running, the data ported over from my Garmin Fenix 8. While I don't think the hardware is quite there yet, it's enough to excite me about the future possibilities.</p><p>I need more time to review my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2-photochromic">ENGO 2 AR glasses</a> properly, but the concept fascinated me when ENGO pitched their running HUD to me. Would seeing real-time stats with just a glance inspire or distract me?</p><p>The design is best suited to cyclists who need to keep their eyes on the road and off their watch or bike computer. However, there's a reason why so many runners rely on audio prompts to display their stats, without having to break stride and look down at their wrists.</p><p>So, I wore these smart glasses on some hilly runs and hikes, using stats like elevation gain and average ascent speed to motivate myself to keep pushing, plus my average heart rate to see if my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load focus</a> would fall into low/high aerobic or anaerobic zones.</p><p>My main takeaways? Like most AR glasses, this running HUD's design and visibility require some improvement, as does the software. However, when we start to see glasses with lighter frames and wider field of view (FoV), fitness-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses" target="_blank">smart glasses</a> could become a real use case.</p>
<h2 id="running-ar-glasses-have-to-find-the-right-balance-2">Running AR glasses have to find the right balance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ENGO knew that runners and cyclists wouldn't put up with heavy AR glasses. The ENGO 2 only weighs 36–41g, depending on the size, or a little over an ounce. That's lighter than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a> (about 50g) without any holographic tech, and well below AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> (90g) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> (87g).</p><p>It also has an all-day battery. It's rated for 12 hours, and while I haven't worn them that long, the percentage barely dipped after an hour of use. Compared to battery-guzzling AR glasses tethered to a phone or battery, that's pretty great.</p><p>Then again, these ENGO 2 glasses don't have traditional smart glasses features like cameras, speakers, or an AI assistant. They're highly specialized and rely on data from another device to work. In other words, they're only that efficient because of their simplicity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-on-face" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses worn on the author's face in a selfie photo; the angle shows how thick the HUD portion of the glasses is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first real issue with the ENGO 2 is that its weight is centered on the bridge and nose pads, where the battery and HUD are located. The guts of the device block my center FoV and make the frames slide down my nose every few strides.</p><p>My second issue is that ENGO was so conscientious about keeping athletes' vision unblocked that the monocular holographic portion is small, blurry (to my near-sighted eyes), and becomes cut off whenever the glasses slide down my nose. I can read everything, but I have to take my eyes and attention off the trail to do so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1274px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="WbKbvk8oD9gcgYhU4EwDEQ" name="Engo-2-render-holographic-display" alt="Render of the ENGO 2 smart glasses, showing what the running stats look like on the HUD." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WbKbvk8oD9gcgYhU4EwDEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1274" height="717" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can see what the running stats look like in this press image; it's too small for me to easily photograph. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ENGO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, ENGO 2 glasses rely on a finicky motion control sensor to swipe between data fields. I'd find myself waving my hand in front of my face several times before it registered the switch, and since there's no "back" option, you must wave through your entire dashboard to return to the first set of stats. It's better than awkward button controls, but still more distracting than I'd like.</p><p>ENGO sent me the photochromic glasses that adjust to the current light. They're easier to wear in any conditions than the static sunglasses, but also a bit goofier looking without that reflective layer, so I might feel a bit self-conscious wearing them at a race.</p><p>Again, this isn't a review. I'm mainly using the ENGO 2 as an example of how challenging it is to get AR glasses right.</p>

<p>The moment I reviewed Meta's Ray-Bans, I saw their fitness potential. So it doesn't surprise me that Meta sees it too: its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley smart glasses</a> will supposedly target athletes. It even added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-aria-gen-2-smart-glasses-look-like-serious-upgrade-on-ray-ban-meta">HR tracking to its research AR glasses</a>, though I wonder how accurate it is compared to a smartwatch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">chest strap</a>.</p><p>Just like the ENGO 2, Meta Ray-Bans tend to slide down my nose while running, and the weight takes getting used to. However, the built-in speakers fulfill the same open-ear headphone niche as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review" target="_blank">Shokz OpenFit 2s</a>, and the camera allows you to capture <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again" target="_blank">candid,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again"> first-person photos</a> or videos of your races or activities.</p><p>Since smart glasses are essentially portable Bluetooth speakers, they can already read audio prompts from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for lap or mile data, or when you leave your target zone. However, that's not as dynamic as AR glasses, which continuously display this data.</p><p>What if someone — Meta, Google, Samsung, or someone else — can pull off the whole package? Could we see AR glasses with audio and AI capabilities packaged with holographic tech and HR tracking? Ideally, with a wider FoV that makes data more naturally readable without obstructing your vision?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meta's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Hypernova AR glasses</a> will feature a monocular display in the bottom-right lens area, along with an upgraded camera and an sEMG band that detects finger gestures for controls. Imagine if you could tap your fingers together mid-stride to pull up your HR data in your vision, then tap them again to clear the display?</p><p>Meanwhile, Google and Samsung are developing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Project Haean smart glasses</a> with holographic capabilities that only weigh 50g or so. There's no guarantee that these glasses will support fitness use cases, but it's reasonable to expect that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr" target="_blank">Android XR</a> might offer turn-by-turn navigation for GPX routes or display your Fitbit or Samsung Health data for workouts.</p><p>Yes, these are just hypotheticals. However, I honestly believe that smart glasses brands will follow ENGO's lead and treat fitness as a major use case, once they're petite and long-lasting enough to appeal to users outside the hardcore tech sphere.</p><p>Now's the time to ask yourself: Do you want a HUD to display your health data, so you're always aware of whether you're sticking to your target pace or falling short? Or do you think your current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or bike computer is enough?</p>

Competition has been heating up, but despite that, quality open-ear earbuds generally cost around $150. That can go even higher, as I discovered when I reviewed the Bose Ultra Open earbuds.</p><p>The Soundcore AeroFit 2 hits the market at a great time by offering a robust open-ear product with a customizable fit that punches above its price point, competing with some products costing much more. Let’s get into it!</p>

<p>The Soundcore AeroFit 2 is available now on Soundcore.com and Amazon.com for $99.99. Both sites are having a sale as I write this, bringing the price down to $79.99. You can pick up a pair in one of four colors: midnight, White, Minty Green, or Midnight Blue.</p><p>If you’re reading this and don’t see that sale price currently, know that the previous AeroFit earbuds were on sale six times in twelve months, so you should be able to pick up the AeroFit 2 at the lower price if you’re willing to wait.</p>

<p>With Soundcore, you can always count on a variety of customization options in their app, but this time around, they took it one step further and gave you some customization options in the earbuds themselves.</p><p>We’ll return to that customization in a moment, but first, let’s examine the hardware. I like the way that Soundcore sets up the status lights on its cases, and the AeroFit 2 follows a similar design language. The front of the large case has a broad LED light that pulses to let you know the charging status, among other things. You get minimal Soundcore branding on the top of the case, a USB-C port on the rear, next to the pairing button.</p><p>I have the Minty Green AeroFit 2, and it is a gorgeous color! Opening the case, you’re greeted by the jellybeans and Hot Tamales. Despite being a Type 2 diabetic, it’s candy that the AeroFit 2’s design reminds me of. Yes, the battery housings that sit behind your ears look like Hot Tamales candy, while the portions that house the speakers look like large jellybeans.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The AeroFit 2 come in a few different colors, but I love the Minty Green hue!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With these open-ear earbuds, you get hooks that loop around your ears, with a piece that holds the battery that sits behind your ears and counterbalances the speaker units that sit over, not inside, your ear canals. The portion that houses the speakers is touch sensitive, and that’s how you control all of the functions.</p><p>The muscle memory acquisition is pretty quick, but they do require you to touch a specific spot on the earbuds to activate controls. Once you have that down pat, controlling playback and call functions is simple and works reliably.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aULGLvrSSzDbeTUtpQ6sBS" name="anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-4-position-adjustability.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 earbud's adjustable ear hook displayed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aULGLvrSSzDbeTUtpQ6sBS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hook is comfortable and doesn’t feel heavy. It has some soft-touch material to it, but what makes it stand out from other options on the market is the 4-position, adjustable speaker module. Once you slip the earbuds on, that module can be repositioned with a satisfying click. Adjust it in one direction, and it feels like it sits tighter to the ear; with an adjustment in the opposite direction, loosening the fit a bit.</p><p>Soundcore says that you’re supposed to adjust the kidney bean-shaped earpieces so they sit right over your ear canal, which is what I did. They were very comfortable and felt secure during runs, and lying on my back during bench presses.</p>

<p>Wearing the AeroFit 2 for extended periods, 4+ hours, I didn’t experience any ear fatigue or hot spots. You won’t necessarily forget you’re wearing them, but you certainly won’t get antsy to get them off your ears. The metallic colors will stand out as you wear them, and they have a bit of a reflective quality to them that may help some runners at night.</p><p>The good news about extended wear is that the battery will hold up, as long as LDAC is not activated. With the volume around 60%, I got roughly nine hours of playback, but in real-world usage, expect to charge once every couple of weeks if your use is primarily for fitness.</p>

<p>A ten-minute quick charge will get you up to four hours of playback. Recharging via the case will get you a total of 42 hours use with LDAC off. The case itself is easy to manage, with regard to battery, as it supports both Qi wireless and USB-C charging.</p>

<p>One of the areas in which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">open-ear products have improved most over the last couple of years</a> is the ability to deliver better bass response. My current favorites, in terms of bass and overall sound quality, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review" target="_blank">Bose Ultra Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear (Open)</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beyerdynamic-verio200-review" target="_blank">Beyerdynamic Verio 200</a>. So, naturally, when I took the time to test how sonics are reproduced, I did some A/B testing with those competitors.</p><p>First, let’s get acquainted with how the AeroFit 2 stands on its own when it comes to sound quality. The power output was the first thing I noticed when connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>. Volume was very comfortable at only 60% of the max—an experience I don’t often have with Bluetooth earbuds. The earbuds perform solidly in a quiet space without competing with ambient sound.</p><p>Listening to "Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes" by Paul Simon and "Down By The River To Pray" from the "O’ Brother Where Art Thou" OST, the soundstage is robust for open-ear earbuds. Simon’s vocals can sound a bit sibilant, depending on the headphones or earbuds I’m testing. That was my experience with that track and the AeroFit 2s. It wasn’t grating or harsh but right on the edge of sibilance.</p><p>Conversely, the horns on Art Blakey’s “Moanin” can be quite harsh and grating, but the AeroFit 2’s didn’t reproduce them that way, making the track a delight to listen to.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>In a quiet space, these open earbuds perform solidly with plenty of power output and a robust soundstage.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When it comes to detail and nuance, you get LDAC support, and with that, you get a respectable level of detail and nuance. You just need to be aware of the fact that activating it will drain your battery much faster.</p><p>Revisiting “Moanin’” but this time with Charles Mingus at the helm, the stereo image separation and instrumentation are quite enjoyable, although the highs lack a bit of sparkle. The track sounds great, but that feeling of almost being there is somewhat lacking in the earbuds’ reproduction of this brilliantly recorded and mastered energetic Jazz romp.</p>

<p>The good news is that if there’s anything you don’t like about the AeroFit 2's sound quality, Anker Soundcore gives you decent EQ options in their well-appointed app. I found the Jazz EQ preset to work best for me, but you can also customize your sound preference by utilizing their eight-band customizable EQ to create your own presets.</p><p>Across the board, listening to music and movies proved to be an enjoyable experience with the AeroFit 2. The app gives you options like their spatial audio #D Surround Sound setting and low-latency gaming mode to help you, along with video and gaming content.</p><p>The most important aspect of an open-ear design is its ability to pump quality sound to your brain while allowing ambient sound in. The AeroFit 2 performed well here. Playing at volumes low enough that they don’t trigger (~76dB) volume warnings, the bass still had sufficient presence, and the overall sound quality was enjoyable. You will deal with issues of auditory masking, that is, when sounds that aren’t your music have similar but louder sounds than your music and overpower it. There is no way around that with open-ear designs.</p><p>A quick note: The Anker Soundcore team added new translation functionality to the earbuds as I was going to publish. After I've had some time to test that, I'll update this article with my findings.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ToMrBYDdGCmm3gFRh4nVKS" name="anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-single.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 showing a single earbud" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToMrBYDdGCmm3gFRh4nVKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At $100, there isn’t much to dislike about Soundcore's accomplishments here. The sound quality is solid, but it isn’t without some caveats, mostly due to the form factor rather than any shortcomings with Soundcore’s engineering choices.</p><p>My primary concern is that the AeroFit 2 can sometimes feel a bit too dark. The lack of sparkle in higher frequencies never makes things feel muddy; there’s just a lack of brightness in vocals and instrumentation.</p><p>On tracks, games, or movies with heavy bass, you will feel the speaker module vibrating energetically against your ear. You have to have turned the volume up quite a bit and be playing something with enough bass, but the vibrations can be a bit annoying. Thankfully, at regular volumes, this wasn’t an issue.</p><p>Commonly seen in Bluetooth TWS earbuds with multipoint, if you activate LDAC or the new translation feature, you will deactivate the multipoint functionality.</p>

<p>After some A/B testing between these, Bose, and Nothing earbuds, I found the AeroFit 2 in the middle regarding sound quality. I prefer the more robust EQ options, bass response, and sparkle of the Nothing Ear Open, but you’ll pay $50 for the difference, even more of a cost difference when the AeroFit 2 goes on sale.</p><p>From my testing, I didn’t find a night-and-day difference in sound quality or features between Bose and the AeroFit 2, so I can’t recommend them over the AeroFit 2 unless it’s a matter of form factor. Bose has more clarity, but the more compelling difference is that of a product having a speaker that sits over your ear versus one that sits on your earlobe, thus leaving the ear canal completely unobstructed.</p><p>For most people comparing the Nothing Ear Open and the Soundcore AeroFit 2, the latter will be the better choice based on sale pricing, battery life, slightly better water resistance, and wireless charging capability. Overall, though, I prefer the sound quality of the Nothing Ear Open, but the difference doesn't carry enough weight for me to wholeheartedly recommend spending the additional money for it unless you comfortably have it to spend.</p>

I say "finally" because the iOS version of Chrome has had it for two whole years. Many people rejoiced at this change, but I'm happy for a very different reason: Google isn't <em>forcing</em> me to use something I can't stand.</p><p>That's right. If you're like me, you can simply press and hold the address bar and drag it back to the top, where it belongs. Other popular browsers, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone-fans-get-loved-feature-for-microsoft-edge-on-android-ios" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge for Android</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-move-url-bar-bottom-your-screen-samsung-internet-browser" target="_blank">Samsung Internet Browser,</a> already allow users to choose where they want the address bar, and I appreciate it when users have a choice in their UI design.</p><p>What I don't like is having buttons on the bottom of my screen. I rejoiced when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-android-navigation-gestures">gesture-based navigation</a> made its official Android debut in Android 10, giving all phones the ability to get rid of those pesky navigation buttons on the bottom of the screen. Then, app developers had to muck it up by moving all the buttons in their apps down to the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="tabs-at-the-top-please-2">Tabs at the top, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="quMTgsriALbV7iozU5iUtA" name="honor-magic-v3-chrome-tabs" alt="Tabs on the top of Google Chrome for Android on an Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quMTgsriALbV7iozU5iUtA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As AC's Jerry Hildenbrand so eloquently put it this week when we were having the discussion about buttons on the bottom, "any phone with a screen bigger than 4 inches needs buttons on the bottom." The idea is that bottom-aligned buttons are easier to reach than ones at the top, something Steve Jobs and co. agreed with in the first iPhone release.</p><p>The problem is that this is only partially true. The original iOS release standardized navigation buttons/tabs for apps at the bottom of the screen because the original iPhone's screen was positively <em>tiny</em> by modern standards. Everything on the original iPhone's display was reachable with your thumb, including the back button on the <strong>top-left</strong> corner of the screen, something absolutely no phone can claim today.</p><p>If I try to open my phone app from the home screen with one hand, it's already literally impossible. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> I use as my daily driver has a display that's simply too wide for my thumb to reach across to the phone icon, and that's on the <strong>bottom-left</strong> corner of the screen. No amount of finger gymnastics makes it possible to touch this icon without grabbing the phone with my other hand to stabilize it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e44J52M3smxrVFRYWXBXwC" name="hard-to-reach-bottom-buttons" alt="Modern phones are too large to be one-handable, negating the advantages of buttons on the bottom of the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e44J52M3smxrVFRYWXBXwC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">No matter how hard I try, it's impossible to tap anything on the bottom-left corner of a modern phone. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alright, now that the phone app is open, I realize it defaults to "Recents," which is the tab in the middle. If I wanted to access the "Favorites" tab, I would once again have to stabilize the phone with my other hand and then click it. This defeats the <em>entire purpose</em> of bottom-aligned navigation buttons.</p><p>If we look back at the Android 4.0 days, I'm reminded of how much better the "tabs at the top" design was, if only for one reason: you could swipe between them. Some of my arguments against bottom-aligned navigation buttons would be negated if developers went back to letting us swipe between tabs. Head to the 4:56 timestamp in this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/_q0G9PgeBGo?si=DzmxclIFuxMcW6s2&t=296">Galaxy Nexus UI tour video</a> and you'll quickly see what I mean.</p><p>This isn't the only thing people have wanted brought back in recent years. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">Clicks cases</a> are bringing physical buttons back. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">best multitasking UIs</a> ditch the iOS 10-inspired Overview screen for something much more efficient and, ironically, older. I could go on with other examples, but you get the point.</p>

<p>Bottom-aligned buttons also take up unnecessary space in a more important part of the screen. We can make fun of it all we want — and we have — but Apple's decision to put The Notch™️at the top of the iPhone's display was because people's natural vision cancels out static elements at the <strong>top </strong>of a screen, not the bottom. Ask most iPhone owners, and they'll tell you they don't even notice the notch.</p><p>But rotate an iPhone and you'll suddenly see that big honkin' chunk missing from the display. It's not like we don't have plenty of screen real estate, but there's no reason I need to be looking at static buttons all the time at the bottom of an app. It's a silly use of space.</p><p>I would love to be given the choice of moving those bottom-aligned buttons back to the top, where I feel they belong. Chrome tabs are at the top. Old-school paper folder tabs are at the top. Some apps, like Google Drive, use a combination of swipable top tabs in conjunction with bottom-aligned buttons.</p><p>As usual, what I want is the freedom of choice for these UI elements. Many people love bottom-aligned tabs, buttons, and address bars, but I certainly don't, and I dislike being forced to use them.</p><p>Anyways, thank you for listening to my TED Talk. I'll see you all next week.</p>

<p>Last year's Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 was a surprisingly impressive midrange phone, one that I had a hard time putting down despite costing less than half that of the flagship phones I tested in 2024. This year, the Moto G Stylus 2025 manages to step things up a notch in ways that I did not expect, and it may put other flagships on the spot, yet again.</p><p>While it's not exactly the AI powerhouse that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> might be, Motorola has upgraded the Stylus 5G in other ways, mostly with better hardware specs and some improvements on the software front. The result is a phone that, at least on paper, feels like it should cost a lot more than it does at just $399.</p><p>I've had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a> for a few days now, and while I'm excited to really put it through its paces, here are some of my favorite things that I've noticed, based on my early impressions of the phone.</p>

<p>Motorola seems to have settled on a design for 2024 and 2025, so the Stylus 2025 doesn't look too different from its predecessor aside from the larger camera housing. That's not a bad thing, and I quite like the design of the Stylus 2025, especially when you take its new colors into account.</p><p>Motorola began its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">partnership with Pantone</a> a few years ago, a collaboration that has seen both companies applying some rather unique color options to Motorola's phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">such as the Razr</a>. The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes decked out in two Pantone colors, and while they both look great, Surf the Web really stands out with its vibrant blue-ish/ indigo hue.</p><p>The color looks great on the phone's frame and soft vegan leather back, giving it an almost neon vibe that I don't often see on smartphones.</p>

<p>Lately, Motorola seems largely against launching phones with the typical white or black color ways, forcing users to pick devices with a bit of flair added to them, even if they're just mid-range or budget phones. The Moto G Stylus 2025 follows this trend, looking arguably more attractive than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series at half the price of the cheapest model (although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">Navy Galaxy S25</a> is a great one).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-8" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the display. Motorola has done a great job shrinking the bezels down on its Stylus phones, to the point where the Moto G Stylus 2025 could almost be mistaken for a flagship phone.</p><p>That said, there's more to the display than meets the eye, at least at first glance. Motorola is using an OLED panel with a "Super HD" resolution, which I admittedly hadn't previously heard of on a phone. With a 2712 x 1220 resolution, it appears to sit somewhere between a Full HD+ panel found on most mid-range and higher-end phones these days and a Quad HD+ display found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium phones</a>.</p><p>The result is a display that's pushing more pixels than even the $800 Galaxy S25 while retaining a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 has better display specs than the base Galaxy S25, a phone that costs twice as much.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not only that, but the display can reach an impressive 3,000 nits of peak brightness, which is higher than all Galaxy S25 models, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. It also includes flicker prevention, which is great for people with PWM sensitivity.</p><p>This is arguably the best display on a Moto G phone, and I hope Motorola continues to incorporate more impressive displays into its devices, especially its flagship models like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">Razr 2025</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GVJAHd8t4KkDoEjurRz5XD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 battery percentage and estimate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVJAHd8t4KkDoEjurRz5XD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4057" height="2282" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With display specs like that, it's natural to wonder about how battery life would be affected. After all, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 isn't the most powerful or efficient chip, and while the battery has a respectable capacity of 5,000mAh, I would have wished to see something larger.</p><p>Still, Motorola seems to have mitigated any concerns, rating the phone for over a day of use on a single charge. So far, the phone manages to exceed my expectations, easily lasting a full day in regular use. I hope to see how that changes as I use it more and the phone conditions itself to my habits, but so far I'm quite pleased with battery life.</p><p>But that's just part of the story.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-11" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 with a charging cable attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola outfitted this $400 phone with 68W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. These are specs I usually only see on higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, so to see them on a phone this affordable is a very welcome surprise. I haven't quite timed how fast the phone fully charges yet, but it will reach 50% quicker than most other phones I've used, and I would feel more than comfortable walking out of the house at that charge.</p><p>It's nice that we're starting to see larger batteries, but being able to charge them quickly is also just as helpful. I really hope this becomes a norm for U.S. phones, especially at this price.</p>

<p>As noted, the Moto G Stylus 2025 isn't an AI powerhouse, so don't expect anything like a Pixel's Gemini Nano tricks here. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is honestly a feature I don't think I can live without on a smartphone, so I'm glad to see its inclusion here.</p><p>There's also a new Sketch to Image feature, which reminds me a bit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's feature of the same name</a>. I haven't played with it much, but early impressions are pretty good so far (anything that can produce a pretty spot-on R2-D2 out of a nearly indecipherable drawing is okay in my books).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TRvj8ydKo5bP2KVegjHdYE" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TRvj8ydKo5bP2KVegjHdYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very curious to see how the cameras fare in my testing. The newer Sony Lytia 700C sensor sounds very promising, and last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> didn't disappoint in the imaging department. That said, I'm not sure why Motorola decided to include a color sensor, other than for uniformity on the camera housing, and I wish it had been left out.</p><p>And of course, there's a built-in Stylus. Like last year's model, the stylus has a much more robust design and doesn't look or feel as cheap as previous models. I don't expect S Pen levels of precision on this passive stylus, although the company says it has 6.4X more responsiveness than its predecessor. I do find it interesting that Motorola's passive stylus keeps getting better as Samsung continues to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">remove features and functions from its S Pen</a>... but I digress. 🍵</p>

<p>I've only had the Moto G Stylus 2025 for a few days and will be testing it more ahead of my full review, but I'm already surprised at just how good this phone feels to use. In the wake of fairly mediocre phones that are somehow priced even higher, the $400 Moto G Stylus 2025 feels like a big step in the right direction for not only Motorola but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>.</p><p>Along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, the Stylus 2025 shows that you won't have to pay a ton of money for a flagship experience, whether that's with a ton of cool AI features or with impressive hardware.</p><p>I only hope that other companies are watching, especially in the U.S., where the midrange smartphone market seems to have stagnated. At this point, it feels as though the Android underdogs like OnePlus and Motorola are pushing the needle in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>It's not like I hate phones or other assorted tech stuff. I'm just not very passionate about them. I will talk your ear off about things like aquariums, antique cars, or woodworking. I'm very keen on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nvidia-jetson-tx2-best-development-package-next-great-idea">electronics</a>, too, just not the already-built ones.</p><p>Anyone who has ever worked with me can tell you that I <em>do</em> hate reviewing phones. I was never particularly good at it, having an eye that was a bit too critical, and I found myself unable to trust anything the manufacturer said about the product. I forced myself to be as objective as I could, not recommending products because I liked them, but because <em>you</em> might. I was there to let you know whether or not they worked as advertised.</p>
<p>Thankfully, my days of a new phone every few weeks and constantly testing things I'm not really interested in are mostly done. I'm happy to let those who are skilled at doing it have all the "fun," and I'll be available for emergencies that, thankfully, rarely happen.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline </a>was a great example.

Yeah, that sounds a little crazy, but I found that a phone that folds up into a small package made my life easier — there isn't a lot of room in your pockets when you're navigating a wheelchair all day.</p><p>I went with Motorola, despite its horrible track record with taking care of its customers by supporting its products, because there seemed to be more potential with the small front display. It does everything I need, and you know what? It does it really well. Unless something that seems better comes along, my next phone will probably be the same; here's hoping it lasts until at least 2026.</p>
<p>So, I spent a lot of words talking about what I don't like, but I love my job. That's because it's morphed into working with and writing about the things I am passionate about: software, platforms, and policy.</p><p>To me, software is elegant (or should be) and useful, even if it is constrained in a plastic and glass shell. The screen only exists to showcase the software, features are there to add value when they can, and the jumble of code and math is what makes a tech product like a phone wonderful.</p><p>I hold the companies that make them, including (and especially) Google, to the highest standards; ones they will likely be unable to meet. To me, that implies they should be working harder to improve what the user experiences.</p>

<p>Their philosophy needs to shine through their products; Apple needs to build <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">pretty yet simple products</a> that are easy to use but also can be powerful if that's what you want. Google needs to set an example as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">the tender of Android</a>; show how to make the software shine and how to deal with the inevitable bugs that will happen. Samsung needs to keep finding ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">give consumers what they want</a> this week, being willing to switch gears when necessary.</p><p>Other companies need to constantly try to find that one thing that sets them apart.</p><p>All this ties together through each corporation's culture and policy. Often, government policy will intertwine and help shape or force the situation. I find all of this fascinating, and even when I'm not working, I'll spend at least a few hours on the internet reading what others are seeing and thinking about it all.</p><p>In the end. I'm lucky to have a full-time gig that I enjoy doing, even if I did have to monkey with phones far too often to get where I am today.</p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I've almost never left the house without having (at least) two phones on me. Part of that is just the nature of the beast when you write about smartphones for a living. However, I was dual-carrying phones long before I began writing full-time.</p><p>Occasionally, I would stick to just one phone, leaving the other behind, whether it was for a special occasion or just a quick trip to the store. However, after Apple had the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">courage</a>" to drop the SIM card tray, the days of popping out the SIM from one phone and using it in another have long been gone. And given the headaches that accompany trying to get my carrier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-esim-android" target="_blank">transfer an eSIM from one phone</a> to another, I wasn't sure if I would ever return to being "normal."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All that changed after my 15-month-old son decided that he was going to take an opportunity to try out for the Orioles. One moment, I'm walking down the hallway with him in one arm and my iPhone in the other, to turn off the lights in his room. The next thing I know, my phone was a good ten feet away from me, face down, with my son nuzzling his head into my shoulder.</p><p>Just like that, I was making an appointment at Best Buy to put my AppleCare Plus subscription to use. The first hiccup was that I needed to leave my phone there overnight, which also meant that I couldn't approve any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA requests</a> needed to access my Verizon account from another device. It didn't seem like that big of a deal, as the Verizon store was in the next shopping center.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3yF4wDNb9vB86awAv3h6VE" name="apple-2fa-code-iphone-x-hero-vioj" alt="Apple ID 2FA Code on iPhone X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3yF4wDNb9vB86awAv3h6VE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Almost two hours later, I was finally able to leave Verizon with my phone number activated on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. In that time, the sales rep tried everything they could to get my eSIM transferred from the iPhone to the Fold 6. At one point, they even got their manager involved, only to come away empty-handed. It turns out that the only thing that worked was activating and inserting a physical SIM card.</p><p>Since then, I've been daily carrying just the Fold 6, and it's actually been a bit liberating. For one, my pockets are lighter, as I'm no longer carrying around an extra pound (literally 1.027 pounds). But there's also just something nice about not needing to worry about where I might have put one of my phones, or trying to decide which phone I should use to accomplish a certain task.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 review cover screen in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7mGPGbcitjef6WE8oaYJj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And while I do occasionally miss using my iPhone, it's been almost a month since "the incident," and I haven't felt the urge to actually go through another potential ordeal. I quite enjoy the idea of being able to just pop my SIM card out of the Fold 6 and into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. There's no need to log into my Verizon account, get on the phone with customer service, or head into a local store. Whenever I'm ready to, it'll take maybe 5 minutes, and I'll be on my merry way.</p><p>I wish I could sit here and tell you what kind of problems prevented the eSIM from being activated on the Fold 6, but neither the Verizon rep nor their manager could figure it out. For all I know, it could have just been a random glitch that happened to occur at the right moment. Maybe it's the universe's way of telling me that I don't need an iPhone *<em>he said</em>, <em>tongue in cheek.*</em></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSELHgx8GUqV28GhWJx3MZ" name="iphone-16-pro-max-sos-z-fold-6-sim-manager-1" alt="iPhone 16 Pro Max SOS mode next to Z Fold 6 SIM Card Manager" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSELHgx8GUqV28GhWJx3MZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's weird is that I haven't run into these kinds of problems when moving eSIMs from carriers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mint-mobile/is-this-a-typo-mint-mobile-is-currently-selling-the-google-pixel-9-for-less-than-the-pixel-9a">Mint Mobile</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a> to other devices. Instead, I only ever deal with issues when it comes to the Verizon eSIM housing my personal mobile number. This leads me to believe it's something on Verizon's end, which also wouldn't come as a shock given how difficult carriers have made it to switch devices.</p><p>No matter what the reason is, it doesn't really matter at the end of the day. This isn't a "redemption story" for eSIM, but instead just further proves that it's not as perfect a solution as we'd be led to believe. It's not like I was trying to activate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/poll-responses-too-soon-for-esim-only-phones">eSIM</a> on the first phone to include support for the technology; it's a phone that not only costs an arm and a leg, but is also not even a year old yet.</p><p>While we regularly see many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> follow in Apple's footsteps, this is one area that I'm thankful they haven't. And frankly, I hope the day of an eSIM-only Android phone never comes.</p>

Still, several leaks have been dropping like hotcakes about the company's next set of foldables, a possible tri-fold, or even the new Galaxy Watch. We thought it would be a good idea to provide some clarity amidst the chaos of leaks, so we're going to give you a concise preview of what to expect.</p><p>This year, Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7. When it comes to wearables, we also expect to see the new Galaxy Watch 8 along with its twin, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>We're hoping that Samsung will finally give its XR headset a name and launch it to the masses this summer, and there have been some murmurs about Samsung's first multi-fold phone.</p><p>On the software front, we heard an interesting rumor that suggested the Korean OEM is working on releasing One UI 8 in line with Google's Android 16.</p>

<p>While a lucky few get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person and watch the magic 'unfold,' the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>.

<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 could finally bring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless foldable</a>, beating its predecessors. Samsung showed off an unnamed phone next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> at the MWC this year, which got us speculating that this could be the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>The phone is reportedly the slimmest we've seen yet, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">official renders suggest</a> that the Z Fold 7 will feature larger inner and outer displays, with a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8.2-inch main screen. Backing these rumors is another avid tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_">@TheGalox_</a> who also spilled the entire specs of the device in a recent leak.</p><p>According to them, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">Z Fold 7</a> may be 4.5mm thin when unfolded, could sport an all-new 200MP camera in lieu of a 50MP sensor we've seen for three generations now, and is rumored to run One UI 8 out of the box.</p>

<p>As for what powers the device, it is rumored to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> with a 4,400 mAh battery. The tipster believes that the new Z Fold 7 will get upgraded durability, a new under-display selfie camera, and "new display layers" that protect the screen.</p><p>That said, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-7s-fan-favorite-feature-is-here-to-stay">rumor</a> surfaced that Samsung was "working on a revamped S Pen packed with more features," while it's also "said to be a bit thicker." Hinting that the new Z Fold 7 could be compatible with a stylus — what could be better than a screenless screen and a stylus?</p><p>This could set this device apart from the rest of the foldables. All in all, we think this year's fold will be much more slimmer and advanced than its predecessor. As for how much it would cost, we have little to no information about it. Presumably could be on the boat as the Z Fold 6, which starts at $ 1900.</p>

<p>Samsung's next clamshell could also see some shifts in the way it looks. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-galaxy-z-flip-7-case-leak-backs-larger-cover-display-rumor">Several leaks</a> have indicated that it will be ditching its usual folder-like cover display for a larger 4-inch end-to-end display, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-motorola-razr-plus-2024-just-crashed-well-below-its-black-friday-price-but-theres-a-catch">Motorola Razr 2024. </a></p><p>Additional specs of the device have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-rendering-changes-specs-leaked">leaked,</a> indicating that an in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency" target="_blank">Exynos 2500 chipset may power the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25s-exynos-chipset-could-outpace-the-snapdragon-8-gen-4-in-efficiency"> </a>to improve the efficiency of the device, although others have suggested it could be the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>As for the cameras, it looks like the device may stick to the same setup of a 50MP primary lens along with a 12MP ultrawide lens. The internal screen may also be slightly bigger when compared to its predecessor, measuring 6.8 inches.  The clamshell is said to be priced at around $1,099, much like its predecessor, and would come with both 256 and 512 storage options.</p>

<p>We've heard some chatter about another clamshell that could show up at the Summer Unpacked — the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE (Fan Edition). Recently, renders of the device showed up online, looking a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>The rumor suggests that the phone will feature a 3.4-inch cover display, accompanied by a 50MP lens and a 12MP camera, and will have an "Aluminum Armor" frame. When flipped open, the device will allegedly have a 6.7-inch display. However, the images suggest that the device will have thicker bezels than the Z Flip 6.</p><p>Some rumors indicate that this device will be powered by Exynos 2500, while others <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">claim the Exynos 2400e</a> in order to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Samsung could be working on One UI 8 behind closed doors, as several rumors claim that it will release this OS in tandem with Google's Android 16.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">first mention</a> of the One UI 8 was by prominent tipster Ice Universe, who posted on X earlier in March. They claimed that the OS could be rolled out much sooner than we expected, considering the delayed rollout of One UI 7.</p><p>The second time we heard about the OS being in development was when leaker Tarun Vats took to X to post a screenshot of the build version of One UI 8 — <em>S938BXXU1BYC1/S938BOXM1BYC1/S938BXXU1BYC1</em> — on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> series. He also claimed that Samsung could launch the OS two months earlier than it usually does, by skipping the One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1 updates.</p><p>And if that wasn't enough, more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">evidence</a> has emerged that suggests Samsung may already be testing One UI 8 on the Samsung S25 series. A Geekbench screenshot shared by Tarun Vats again shows the Galaxy S25 (SM-S931B) running a One UI 8 build based on Android 16.</p>

<p>However, Samsung also had something to say when several rumors about One UI 8 kept cropping up. In response to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3561205305513043832&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.community.samsung.com%2Ft5%2FQuestions%2FOne-Ui-8-Beta%2Fm-p%2F3167416%23M35&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung%2Fsamsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">community post</a>, a One UI Beta team member states there's nothing official about One UI 8 for stable users or testers.</p><p>They state that while rumors have brought awareness to "certain devices" with One UI 8, "these are likely internal Samsung test units." They add that these devices are typically "used for early-stage development and are not available for public use."</p><p>So we have our hopes up and our fingers crossed that Samsung may likely show us a little sneak peek into the world of their new OS.</p>

<p>We haven't seen many Galaxy Watch 8 rumors yet, but we did spot some early signs that the smartwatch could be in the works. A leak spilled beans that the next-gen watches may have quietly passed safety checks.</p><p>Two batteries with the codenames <em>EB-BL330ABY and EB-BL505ABY</em> are likely meant for the next Galaxy Watch 8 series and have allegedly received the SafetyKorea certification. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-batteries-safetykorea-certification/" target="_blank">XpertPick</a>, the next generation of the Galaxy Watch may come as a duo: the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Regarding the battery capacity, a TUV certification has revealed that the EB-BL330ABY model will feature a substantial 435mAh battery. To put things into perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 </a>40mm model features a 300 mAh battery while the 44mm one has a 425 mAh battery.</p><p>We also hope that this year's watch could bring all the features that didn't make the cut on the Galaxy Watch 7 series, like the rumored blood-glucose monitoring that Samsung claimed to be developing "as early as the second half of 2024."</p><p>While we wait, here's what we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">wish to see</a> from the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Samsung's Project Moohan</a> XR Headset has been the talk of the town lately after it was unveiled at Unpacked in January and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-to-give-us-a-closer-look-at-android-xr-headset">showcased more vividly</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a> in Barcelona. We have seen Samsung openly talk about the headset, without giving away too much of its specs, but it's possible we could get a full launch at the summer Unpacked.</p><p>When it comes to design, the headset looks pretty sleek, or as AC's Michael Hicks says, "It looks a lot like the Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro had a baby." It has a rigid strap similar to the Meta Quest Pro that can be adjusted with a dial on the back.</p><p>Within the headset is a pair of pancake lenses that provide exceptional clarity for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">4K Micro-OLED screen</a> panels Samsung is using.

Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a> will be at the core of this headset that will run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>, a new version of Android that Google says is "the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era."</p><p>When the company first teased the headset, it also confirmed that it would come with full support for hand tracking and eye tracking, as well as motion-based controllers. And thanks to a leak from SamMobile, it seems that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/first-party-samsung-controllers-for-its-project-moohan-xr-headset-may-have-been-spotted">first-party controllers </a>for the headset are in the works. But if true, it's hard to tell if the company will ship them with the headset or sell them separately.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung's XR headset could be priced at around $1,500 or less, as it was hinted that it would be cheaper than the Apple Vision Pro. Since we have almost all the specs in place, we're hoping that Samsung will finally launch the XR headset this summer after teasing it for months on end.</p>

<p>Samsung has time and again dropped hints that it is working on a tri-fold device. Be it during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">January Unpacked</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC</a> this year.</p><p>A Korean news website recently stated that Samsung Electronics is reportedly working on bringing the "Galaxy G Fold," along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, later this year.</p><p>However, we don't really know much about the specs, just that the phone will feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>Another important detail that emerged from this leak is that this phone may not come with an S Pen. This is likely due to the absence of a digitizer, a magnetic field that enables a pen-like accessory to interact with the screen.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored" target="_blank">rumor surfaced in January</a> that stated the phone could have a "G-shaped fold style" with an inward folding mechanism. This could mean that the phone would fold the screen inward twice, which could be based on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/29253/" target="_blank">Flex G screen prototype</a> that surfaced at CES in 2022.</p><p>Additionally, since this would be the company's first multi-fold phone, there appears to be speculation that it will initially produce around 200,000 units to gauge the public's reception of this phone.</p><p>“As this is a form factor that is being introduced [by Samsung] for the first time, only a small quantity will be produced in some countries, just like when the Fold SE was released last year,” an industry insider told ETNews.</p>

<p>Samsung has always surprised us with something at the end of Unpacked, be it a quick tease of the Galaxy Ring or the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. So we're hoping to see some tech drop at this year's summer Unpacked as well.</p><p><strong>Ballie, the AI companion robot </strong></p><p>After five years of hinting at its existence, Samsung could finally be launching its AI robot this summer, which could be the July Unpacked.</p><p>Ballie is a Gemini-powered multimodal robot that can help users with fashion, health, and wellness while also handling home tasks like adjusting lights, setting reminders, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6" name="samsung-ballie-floor-hero" alt="Samsung's Ballie AI robot sitting on the floor as its user talks to it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hGxL9HRRceBit4bv76dS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For instance, if you ask the robot "Hey Ballie, how do I look?" The AI robot will "look" at you through its camera before offering a set of "styling recommendations," which could include accessories or an entirely new set of clothes to pick from.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/projectors/home-robot-ballie/?r=true&referrer=usnewsroom" target="_blank">Ballie</a> will also be able to engage in natural conversation to help users manage homes, including adjusting lighting, greeting people at the door, personalizing schedules, setting reminders, and more.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Galaxy Ring 2</strong></p><p>While we don't know if Samsung will show off its next smart ring at the summer Unpacked, some rumors hint at this possibility.</p><p>A DigiTimes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">report</a> claims the Galaxy Ring 2 will have "more accurate health data sensors and improved AI functionalities." It also claims the battery life will "exceed seven days," or the approximate capacity of the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a>. According to another tipster, the ring is expected to be "thinner" than the 2.6mm first-gen model, with "longer battery life."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-unpacked-2025" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Ring at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cuY6haPJuzfi4AAY4D9DGK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/next-galaxy-ring-could-come-with-sensors-to-measure-body-and-surface-temperatures">also heard some chatter </a>about the ring having new sensors that measure not just the surface but also the skin temperature of the user, as well as other surfaces. These sensors are said to be placed on the side that comes in contact with the user's skin, just like the ones on the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>The company also filed a separate<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-patent-future-galaxy-ring-control-devices/" target="_blank"> patent</a> in February, which demonstrates the rings' ability to control other devices, functioning as a cursor to move objects around on a screen that resembles a laptop or tablet.</p><p>While all of this seems great to have in a smart ring, only time will tell if the company will tease the ring this summer.</p>
<p><strong>Galaxy Buds Pro 4</strong></p><p>Lastly, if you're wondering whether Samsung will launch the<strong> Buds Pro 4</strong> this year, then it is highly unlikely since the company launches one every two years and we will probably see one launch in 2026. That said, Samsung never misses a chance to surprise us, so you never know.</p>

For right now, buyers can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/dp/B0B1VQ1ZQY" target="_blank"><strong>20% off the lockscreen ad version of the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet</strong></a>, which is one of our favorites from the Fire tablet lineup.</p><p>We like the Fire Max 11 for its beautiful 11-inch screen, its roughly-14-hour battery life, and the already low price tag. This model comes with just 64GB of storage, but it also sports both a front- and rear-facing camera, a fingerprint scanner, dual speakers and more.</p><p>While performance is nothing really to write home about, this is probably still the best pick out of the Fire tablet lineup for work purposes, backed by 4GB of RAM and a MediaTek MTK8188J that's decent.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for an affordable tablet that still boasts decent performance; battery life is a major selling point for you; you prefer tablets with a larger screen.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>having a high refresh rate is a priority to you; you don't like Amazon's user interface; you want to be able to access Play Store without side-loading.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review">Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet</a> is a decent little device, and especially for the price point compared to competitors. It's also our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-for-work-and-play">best Amazon tablet for work and play</a>, largely because its performance and display are a couple of steps ahead of the retailer's lower-end offerings.</p><p>We like the Fire Max 11 for its 11-inch screen, and the fact that Amazon says you can get up to 14 hours of battery life. It also offers easy access to Alexa voice commands for those who want to integrate the device into their Google-based smart home setup.</p><p>As for some of the downsides, the display only features a 60Hz refresh rate, and it also has just 4GB of RAM. Those who don't like Amazon's devices may also prefer going with a different brand, though its certainly worth thinking about at this price point.</p>

<ul><li>Startup company Perplexity AI is reportedly engaging in talks with Motorola and Samsung to have its software preloaded or available as a "default" assistant option.</li><li>A deal has supposedly been met with Motorola to have its AI pre-loaded onto devices as a secondary option besides Gemini.</li><li>Samsung's talks are reportedly still early; however, if it works, the brand could bring Perplexity's app to consumers or have its AI as a "default" option.</li><li>Samsung and Motorola are no strangers to custom on-device AI as both have crafted Galaxy AI and Moto AI, respectively.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports claim a couple of well-known smartphone brands could seek an AI startup company's software for future devices.</p><p>The report stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/perplexity-in-talks-to-integrate-assistant-into-samsung-motorola-phones">Bloomberg,</a> which cites people "close to the matter" by saying Perplexity AI is seeking arrangements with notable OEMs. Supposedly, the company is looking to go toe-to-toe with the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a> as a potential on-device AI assistant. Sources claim Perplexity AI has reached out to Samsung and Motorola about the possibility of being loaded onto phones as a "default" option.</p><p>Interestingly, the report claims Perplexity AI has already agreed upon a deal with Motorola's parent company, Lenovo, for assistant integration.</p><p>This agreement will allegedly have Perplexity's software "pre-loaded" onto Motorola's phones as a secondary option besides Gemini. Not only will future Motorola consumers see a marketing push by the brand to try out Perplexity, but a "tailored" version will be available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">its Razr foldable</a>.</p><p>Sources add Samsung's talks are still early. This is apparently partly due to Samsung's close relations with Google and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">haul of AI features</a>. However, if things go well, Samsung could feature Perplexity's AI as an assistant option or pre-load its app for users.</p>

<p>Also, Samsung reportedly has dealings with Perplexity after investing in the startup in 2024. For context, Perplexity AI was founded in 2022, and Samsung is supposedly thinking of investing another sum of money into the company in 2025, per Bloomberg. With that, it seems talks <em>might </em>go favorably for Perplexity, but these things are usually complicated, so there's no telling until it happens.</p><p>Samsung has continued its push for an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">AI Phone</a>" via its Galaxy series for quite some time, introducing Galaxy AI and more to consumers. When the Galaxy S25 launched in January, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">quickly expanded</a> AI Overviews in Circle to Search for the newest flagship trio. The generative AI-based feature now surfaces additional information for visual search queries.</p><p>Galaxy users also have a heavy dose of Gemini through on-device means for assistance whenever needed.</p><p>On the other hand, you have Motorola, which brought its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/moto-ai-open-beta-program">Moto AI</a>" suite of features to beta testers late last year. It was only available for select phones, but Moto AI included tools for notification summaries, recall capabilities, and "enhanced" recording with transcriptions available. The company remains confident in its software, stating feedback will "help shape Moto experiences, ensuring that what’s developed meets consumer wants and needs."</p>

<hr>
<p>It seems a U.S. federal judge has finally delivered their ruling regarding the antitrust case against Google's alleged monopolization of ad space.</p><p>Leonie Brinkema, a US District Judge, reportedly declared Thursday (Apr. 17) that Alphabet, the parent company of Google, violated antitrust laws for advertisements. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-partially-loses-us-advertising-tech-antitrust-case">Bloomberg</a> brought the ruling to light, adding this violation concerns "advertising exchanges and tools used by websites to sell ad space."</p><p>However, for the other side of this case, which focuses on buying display ads, Brinkema reportedly states Google "didn't meet the definition" of a monopoly.</p><p>Ads are a key aspect of Google's business and its practices with it, which is why the US government has looked into its "monopoly power." To that end, Brinkema stated Thursday that Google "willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets."</p><p>The judge says Google has only bolstered its monopoly power within the ad space by "depriving rivals of the ability to compete." Brinkema states that not only did this obscure potentially "desirable" products from its publishers, but it also violated the competitive process.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google defended itself by saying, "Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable, and effective."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZQy35xwU77WcDvb9Gkc6AF" name="google-logo-nyc-plants.jpg" alt="A photo of the Google Logo surrounded by plants at the company's NYC headquarters building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZQy35xwU77WcDvb9Gkc6AF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This case isn't done yet. Judge Leonie Brinkema's involvement was to determine if this ad monopoly case had merit. Since part of it reportedly does, Brinkema has informed the parties involved that they will seek a remedy by "separating the court proceedings."</p><p>This determination of merit started last year in November when the DOJ (Department of Justice) said Google is "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-once-twice-three-times-a-monopolist-says-the-justice-department">once, twice, three times a monopolist</a>." During the closing arguments of the antitrust case regarding Google's ad-tech business, U.S. lawyers claimed the company was running a monopoly due to its acquisition of Doubleclick, an advertising company. Again, Google stood with its practices, stating the DOJ proved "the exact opposite" of its accusations.</p><p>Google's defense argues that its "conduct is a story of innovation in response to competition" and a prime catalyst behind its $31 billion in revenue in 2023, thanks to a healthy market.</p><p>Alongside this ad-tech space monopoly case was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">search monopoly court case</a>. The DOJ has pushed Google to sell Chrome after a judge found the company guilty of running an illegal search monopoly. The judge is also urging Google to separate Android from Search and Play and rework its data licensing.</p><p>Bloomberg adds that a new trial will begin Monday (Apr. 21) to determine a remedy for this situation.</p>

<p>We see a wave of new tech gadgets every year, sometimes revolutionary but most times just evolutionary. Samsung has gotten into the latter rhythm over the past few years with incremental updates for its most popular tech products, like phones and wearables. This year, we'll most likely be seeing the Galaxy Watch 8 launch, maybe around July, like in 2024. The Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7 question is a valid one, as Samsung has made significant changes to the Watch 7. So, what's in store for the Watch 8?</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 will no doubt be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung smartwatches of 2025</a>, but if you're a Watch 7 owner, should you consider upgrading? As of writing this, Samsung hasn't officially announced the Watch 8, so we're essentially comparing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">rumored specs and features</a> to the Watch 7.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7-design-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-app-drawer.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's app drawer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ubr3aUgtSFHaXthdqnK6fZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We don't have any leaked images of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 just yet, so we're going to assume it won't look all that different than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. Early rumors suggested that Samsung might adopt a squircle design, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but we believe it will stick to its circular design. There could be a few design tweaks, changes to textures, and new colors, but it should look more or less the same.</p><p>In terms of variants, the Galaxy Watch 8 should come in two sizes of 40mm and 44mm, each having Wi-Fi and LTE options. The screen sizes should also be 1.3 and 1.5 inches, just like the Watch 7. The Watch 8 could get a brighter AMOLED display, as this is one spec that's easy to tweak going into a new generation.</p><p>One way of differentiating the Galaxy Watch 8 from the Watch 7 would be through colors. We'll most certainly have a few exclusive shades for the casing and straps. The mounting bracket should be backward compatible with the Watch 7, so you'll be able to reuse older straps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-7-01.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pQLgepFdrm8vcqpuvqGPRA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> comes in a 40mm model with a 1.3-inch Super AMOLED display and a 44mm model with a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED display. Samsung has gone with Sapphire Crystal for scratch protection, which is the same material we should expect on the Watch 8, too.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7's display has a peak brightness of up to 2,000 nits, which is the same as that on the older Watch 6. In daily use, we found the screen to be crisp and highly legible even under direct sunlight. The Galaxy Watch 7 comes with a sports band that matches the color of the watch's casing. You can mix and match the strap type and colors via Samsung.com, though.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7-specs-and-hardware-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 vs. Galaxy Watch 7: Specs and hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-3d-watch-face.jpg" alt="3D watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQbshdpZ6mYeN6wdpY8bQg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We're expecting the Galaxy Watch 8 to come in at the same price as the Watch 7, which is $299.99 for the 40mm model with Wi-Fi. The 44mm model should start at $329.99, and add another $50 for the LTE variants. There is no evidence yet to suggest that prices will increase, even with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">heavy tariffs</a> being imposed by the U.S. on other countries.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 7 came with a newer Exynos W1000 chip, and we expect Samsung to stick with the same one this year. It's not uncommon for the company to reuse its processors across generations. Having said that, the Watch 8 could always make the switch and debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025" target="_blank">Qualcomm's second-generation Snapdragon W5</a> chip, which is said to be better at handling advanced AI functionality. Perhaps this is one way Samsung gets Gemini to run on its watches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3674px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="vuxNbiHMbhfntEpiiysHQY" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-health-sensor-button-color.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7's curvy new sensor array and orange home button accent" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vuxNbiHMbhfntEpiiysHQY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3674" height="2067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the rest of the specs, we expect it to be similar to the Watch 7. The Galaxy Watch 8 should come with 2GB of RAM, at least 32GB of storage, dual-band GPS, IP68 dust and water resistance, and a MIL-STD-810H rating for toughness.</p><p>It should also have the same rejigged BioActive sensor that debuted with the Watch 7 for advanced health monitoring like the AGEs Index. We could see some new health metric tracking with the Watch 8, to give it some exclusivity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-blood-sugar-monitoring-rumor">Blood glucose and diabetes</a> monitoring are two things Samsung is working on, which could launch with the Watch 8.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is expected to have a similar battery life to the Watch 7. For now, we only have reports claiming that the 44mm model will have a 435mAh battery, which is just 10mAh more than the Watch 7. Samsung estimates a 40-hour runtime for the Watch 7, which is expected to carry over to the Watch 8 as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXSqv7G3dQMgMTm5UvZZUj" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-band-collection-169" alt="Galaxy Watch 7 bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXSqv7G3dQMgMTm5UvZZUj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Watch 7 has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, an IP68 rating, and MIL-STD-810H certification. The new addition is Samsung's improved BioActive Sensor, which is capable of more accurate health and fitness tracking thanks to the redesign of the LED sensors. The glass dome underneath the watch is also more pronounced, so it makes better skin contact.</p><p>The downside to this design is that the Watch 7 loses its ability to be charged wirelessly on the back of a Samsung phone with reverse wireless charging capability. The charging puck has also been specially redesigned, which means the Watch 7 won't fast-charge effectively on older Galaxy Watch chargers.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 has a 300mAh or 425mAh battery capacity and supports  WPC-based fast charging. In our review, the 44mm variant lasted two days with the AOD (always-on display) disabled, which we think is pretty decent.</p>

<p>If Samsung follows the same launch timeline as 2024 for the Galaxy Watch 8, it could be one of the first smartwatches to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>. This would also mean we get a new One UI 7 Watch version with similar design themes to the One UI 7 on Samsung's phones.</p><p>We don't know what new features will be added, but we should get a pretty good idea by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">Google I/O 2025</a>, where many of the new features will likely be demoed. Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Google Assistant will finally be replaced by Gemini</a> on watches too, although it's unclear what nano version of Gemini can run on just 2GB of RAM.</p><p>One thing's for sure: Samsung will add some sort of exclusive health and fitness tracking features that are not available on the Watch 7. These features could eventually come to it through a software update, but Samsung will want some exclusivity for the Watch 8 for at least the first few months in order to drive sales.</p><p>The Watch 7 was already great at sleep tracking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-excited-about-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-health-feature">sleep apnea monitoring</a>, so it'll be interesting to see how these features are improved in the new model.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a4ziGZeERoenUYX7sEUuwY" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review-simple-digital-red-vs-blue.jpg" alt="Simple Digital watch face on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a4ziGZeERoenUYX7sEUuwY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ara Wagoner / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Galaxy Watch 8 launch still some time away, it's hard to say that it will offer better value than the Galaxy Watch 7 just yet. All leaks and rumors so far point towards it being an incremental upgrade, which is to say, it will have a few new things, but nothing that would warrant trading in the Watch 7 for. If Samsung keeps the same pricing, it could very well be the best Samsung watch to buy in 2025 (provided you don't already have the Watch 7).</p><p>If you don't want to wait till July, I think you can confidently pick up the Galaxy Watch 7 today at a discounted price and be happy with it for the next few years. It doesn't have any deal-breaking problems, should get good software support for the next few years, and it best complements your Samsung phone. The minimalist design is something I personally love, as you can adapt it to any attire with the right watch strap.</p>

<p>Samsung did not think outside the box with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, bringing fairly menial upgrades to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">popular foldable</a>. With the newer Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, we're holding out a much more significant upgrade.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will probably have a newer processor and a better cover screen, but we're also hearing talk about a possible Z Flip FE launching alongside it. Allegedly, this might be a cheaper version of the Flip 7.</p><p>If you are looking to upgrade your Z Flip or are just curious about the upcoming small-form foldable phone from Samsung, here's a comparison of the two devices based on all the information we can glean from current rumors, leaks, and speculations.</p>

<p>All the leaks suggest that the Z Flip 7 will feature much slimmer bezels and larger displays, both internally and externally. The outer cover screen is expected to be significantly larger, expanding from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6" target="_blank">Flip 6</a>'s 3.4-inch AMOLED display to a 4-inch AMOLED screen. Additionally, we can also look forward to the screen refresh getting a significant boost, increasing from 60Hz to a buttery smooth 120Hz.</p><p>The internal screen is expected to be upgraded as well, increasing in size over the last generation. Apparently, it will measure 6.85 inches in size, instead of the older 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X LTPO display.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-leak">Rumors suggest</a> a softer, curvier design for the next-gen Z Flip 7, featuring more rounded edges rather than the sharp, square aesthetic of the Z Flip 6.</p><p>There's also been some excitement concerning the crease itself. Samsung debuted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless panel at MWC </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">2025</a>, which is likely to be utilized in the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 series. Another display upgrade we're betting on is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-pholed-display-2025-potential">addition of a blue phosphorescent material</a> to the OLED panel to increase its efficiency and cut down on energy consumption for an improved battery life.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-galaxy-z-flip-6-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 vs. Galaxy Z Flip 6: Cameras</h2>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 finally bumped the primary camera of Samsung's more stylish foldable lineup. While we do wish to see cameras as powerful as the S25 Ultra or the S25 Plus on the Flip 7, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">likely not going to happen</a>. That said, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 produces very respectable images with impressive zoom quality and color reproduction. It's not the best, but it definitely gets the job done.</p><p>Therefore, we're expecting to see identical cameras on the Flip 7, with the primary sensors being 50MP wide and 12MP ultrawide cameras. Some whispers on the interweb suggest a front camera upgrade, but we'll have to wait until the expected summer 2025 launch to know for sure.</p>

<p>Performance is expected to be the highlight of the Z Flip 7, as we anticipate seeing 12GB of RAM paired with the top-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</a> for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. This is the same chipset from the flagship Galaxy S25 trio, so the results should be impressive.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy is currently the fastest mobile SoC in the world, so it's no joke that the tiny Flip 7 will be powered by one.</p><p>We're also expecting to see a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-could-give-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-a-battery-boost">battery boost on the Flip 7</a>, which will feature a 4,300mAh battery, replacing the Flip 6's 4,000mAh cell. This, paired with the more efficient display and processor, should result in a markedly improved uptime compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Lastly, we can expect to receive Android 15 with One UI 7 on the Flip 7, along with Samsung's seven-year commitment to platform and security updates. That said, there has been speculation that Samsung will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">debut One UI 8</a>, based on Android 16, with its upcoming foldables, which could give Samsung a head start over much of the competition.</p><p>Naturally, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> goodies featured on the S25 series will likely make their way to the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7 as well.</p>

<p>Since the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't out yet, we can't say decisively whether it's better or worse than the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Based on leaks and trends, it's safe to assume that the Flip 7 will cost more or less the same as the Flip 6 at launch. It's definitely going to boast upgraded hardware, but we're not yet sure whether the upgrades will be good enough to warrant an upgrade.</p><p>If you're not a Flip 6 owner, though, getting the latest version of Android out of the box, along with tons of fun AI features and the promise of seven years of OS and security updates, is reason enough to buy the Flip 7 once it's available.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus is seemingly preparing another Android tablet launch, but its specifics are all speculative.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&RequestTimeout=500&calledFromFrame=Y&application_id=8QSd69tmvBJKN7cKPFOhsw%3D%3D&fcc_id=2ABZ2-OPD2408">FCC listing</a> was discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oneplus-pad-flagship-tablet-coming-soo-us_id169547">PhoneArena</a>, which seemingly hints at the next Pad tablet from the Chinese OEM. The certification is rather light; however, it clues us into the potential name of the tablet. According to the provided files, the company may look to call the tablet the "OnePlus Pad 3R" whenever it launches in the U.S.</p><p>However, the publication reiterates that a previous leak cited the tablet as the "OnePlus Pad 2 Pro." While it seems the FCC listed name <em>could be </em>more accurate, we'll have to see when OnePlus teases it officially.</p><p>The FCC listing didn't offer concrete details about the tablet's supposed specs aside from its Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC capabilities. Rumors about its specifications arrive via speculation that OnePlus' next tablet could mirror OPPO. If this happens, rumors claim OnePlus could mirror the OPPO Pad 4 Pro with a 13.2-inch display, a 13MP primary lens, and an 8MP selfie camera.</p><p>OnePlus could also pack a 12,140mAh battery into the device with 67W wired fast charging. Ramping up its strength is rumored to be Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/new_oneplus_tablet_gets_certified_by_the_fcc_could_be_the_pad_3_pro-news-67441.php">GSMArena</a> draws attention to OPPO's Pad 4 Pro launch in China, which only happened a week ago. The tablet was originally introduced to consumers last year in December, preparing them for its eventual 2025 market debut. Accompanying that device in December was the launch of the OnePlus Pad 3; however, it notes that the device features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oppo-unveils-the-first-android-tablet-with-mediateks-dimensity-8350-chipset">MediaTek Dimensity 8350</a> SoC.</p><p>The chip was also featured in the OPPO Pad 3, which was designed to be more budget-friendly. Considering the rumors, it seems OnePlus might look to return to more flagship-level specs and power with its next release, like OPPO.</p><p>OnePlus' tablets have consistently leaned toward power, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-pro-launched-in-china">the Pad Pro</a> featured the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip. That same SoC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/the-oneplus-pad-2-costs-more-but-its-upgrades-make-it-worth-the-price">rolled into the Pad 2</a>, but despite it not being a Pro model, OnePlus truly dug deep with its upgrades, which also raised its price to $550 (from $479) when it rolled into the U.S. There are concerns that the tariffs introduced by President Trump could impact pricing even more, but time will tell.</p>

<p>If you buy the Quest 3S <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s">from Meta directly</a>, you can save $30 on the headset <em>and</em> another $20 on the official Carrying Case.</p><p>Of course, I can also point you to a "free" Meta Quest 3S deal from Verizon, if $269 sounds like too much.</p><p>Upgrade your home internet to Verizon 5G Home Plus, and the carrier will give you a free Meta Quest 3S 128GB (or 43-inch Samsung TV) to go with your plan if you use it for at least six months. Depending on how much you spend on internet now — and whether you prefer 5G or cable — getting the free Quest 3S could be the cherry on top of better service.</p>

There are more options, a wide variety of form factors, and no matter what your budget is, there's a phone for you.</p><p>However, those reasons don't seem to translate when it comes to market share in the U.S., as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/united-states-of-america" target="_blank">StatCounter</a> has iOS holding more than 57% of the market share, with Android coming in at just north of 42%. This is a stark contrast when you pull back and look at the global market, as more than 70% of the world runs on Android.</p>

<p>With those kinds of numbers, even on a global scale, you might think that we'd see more apps arrive on Android first, if not at the same time as iOS. Unfortunately, that's not the case, as we still see iOS get the first crack when many new apps hit the scene, only to come to Android later, if at all.</p><p>Such is the case with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notion.com/product/mail">Notion Mail</a>, an app that I've been extremely excited about since I learned it was in development. After years of being able to stay on top of my various inboxes, I've practically given up, resigning myself to seeing more than 5,000 unread emails across multiple accounts. My hope was that Notion Mail would offer some type of help in this struggle, mainly because of how much I already enjoy using Notion, and frankly, the app represents a breath of fresh air.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.10%;"><img id="VsUPPuuUfriPR8FEPdCPjR" name="notion-mail-hero-banner" alt="Notion Mail announcement banner hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VsUPPuuUfriPR8FEPdCPjR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2548" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Notion)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Much to my dismay, the app is currently only available in your browser and on the Mac, with the iOS version "coming soon." So what about Android? According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notion.com/product/mail#:~:text=When%20will%20Notion%20Mail%20be%20available%20on%20mobile%20devices%3F">Q&A section</a> on the official landing page, it's coming "in 2025." For some odd reason, I never even thought that Notion Mail would be platform-limited on release. Especially given that both Notion and Notion Calendar can be downloaded on practically anything.</p><p>So, why is Notion targeting iOS and macOS first, before Android or Windows? Well, the Windows answer is actually pretty easy, as you can just log in via the web and use a web app. I might be off base, on the Mac, the Notion Mail app seems like it's nothing more than a wrapper for the web app, which isn't all that surprising.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="M6ZEcVZe37cXuNYYMzQ75i" name="notion-mail-iphone-mockup-render" alt="Notion Mail mockup on the iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M6ZEcVZe37cXuNYYMzQ75i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1016" height="572" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Notion)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about Android? Over the years, we've seen and heard complaints from developers that iOS is just an easier platform to develop for. However, I was also under the assumption that Google had been making strides to close the gap for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/reported-changes-to-android-development-arent-really-a-change">Android developers</a>.</p><p>After discussing this topic idea with a few colleagues, I was immediately reminded of the real reason. The same thing that makes Android so appealing to the masses is the very thing that holds it back from being the primary focus for developers. There are simply too many devices that need to be tested and accounted for, not to mention the various form factors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="85kFgjerPQG8dD7qqwC4ZJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Android Central's best of 2024 phone and accessories selection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/85kFgjerPQG8dD7qqwC4ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To put this in perspective, Apple's current lineup of phones consists of seven different models. That includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-plus-vs-iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-max">iPhone 15 and 15 Plus</a>, which were released in 2023. Throw in the entire current crop of iPads, and we're up to a total of 13 devices, across three different screen sizes.</p><p>In comparison, Google offers a total of eight devices, ranging from the 6.1-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and maxing out with the 11-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">Pixel Tablet</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> mixed in. Samsung blows them both away with a combination of more than 20 phones and tablets that are readily available for purchase from the company's website. Between Samsung and Google alone, there are more than 30 devices to account for, with screen sizes ranging from 6.1 inches to 14.6 inches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8" name="samsung-ecosystem-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Samsung ecosystem of devices including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Buds 3 Pro, Samsung laptop, and Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nuw4Jq35aqgLoA6B4jZxR8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On top of that, you have to take into account the various Android versions that are in the wild. Obviously, the varying versions of Android play a big role, as new APIs and features are introduced (and removed) with each release. But, I'm not just talking about an app being able to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-13-review">Android 13</a> and above, as we also have the various OEM "skins" that factor into the equation with their own set of APIs.</p><p>So, is there anything that can actually be done? I'm not a developer by any means, but I don't really think so. I mean, it's 2025, and this is still something that happens on a regular-enough cadence to be an annoyance. Unfortunately, this is just the way the cookie crumbles, so I'll just have to continue staring out the window like a sad puppy waiting for Notion Mail to hit the Play Store. Or at least for something else to come along and distract me for a while.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome 135 on Android introduces a long-requested bottom address bar feature this week.</li><li>The said feature had been available for iOS users since 2023, and other browsers like Samsung Internet have also had this feature for a while.</li><li>The latest feature update has been popping up for Chrome on Android this week, and a wider roll out is expected soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome users will now have an easy way to browse, especially for large-screen phones. The search giant has started rolling out a new update, which shifts the address bar from its conventional top position to the bottom.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/15/chrome-bottom-address-bar-android-135/">9to5Google</a>, Google has initially tested the bottom address bar on its Chrome app for Android last October, and the company is now rolling it out to the stable version of the browser app on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones.</a></p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="7HeVbnB2JkXAWxyoVXS6u7" name="chrome-135-android-bottom-address-bar" alt="Chrome 135 bottom address bar option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HeVbnB2JkXAWxyoVXS6u7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication further notes that some users on the stable build, which is the Chrome 135 version, are already seeing the new prompt "You can touch and hold to move the address bar to the bottom.” Alternatively, Chrome settings also has a new section dubbed "Address bar" that allows users to change its placement to top or bottom, per their preference.</p><p>Further, aside from the positioning, nothing significantly has changed with the new address bar. The three-dot menu and its options like new tab, incognito tab, bookmarks, and history remain the same, and users would still have to reach for the top of the screen to get them, while having them reordered to the bottom would have been ideal as they are the most used options while browsing.</p>

<p>The said feature appears to have just started popping up on the Chrome 135 version this week, and the wider roll-out of the feature is expected soon. It has been a widely requested feature as the phones today have become hard to reach to the top, especially when using with a single hand.</p><p>Such handy options are already available in browsers like Samsung Internet and Arc browser. It is good to see Google catch up and bring the most requested feature finally to Android devices, whereas iOS users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-ios-move-address-bar-bottom">had this functionality</a> for a while now, since 2023 to be precise.</p>

Maybe even yours.</p><p>To make it even worse, these providers are based in China. To Americans, anything related to China is often viewed as bad, but the fact that there are potentially billions of customers using these services is real. Knowing they've been compromised is terrifying to many network security professionals.</p>
<p>I take any reports from a company that profits from network security with a grain of salt, but after reading the report in full, the claims sound valid on most counts.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-mobile-interconnect-provider-2">What is a mobile interconnect provider?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb" name="verizon-sign-storefront-widecrop.jpg" alt="Verizon store sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/og58fKiBAUZCKvQ3UyMqyb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To understand why this matters, you need to know what is being affected. A mobile interconnect provider is exactly what it sounds like — a thing that allows two or more different mobile networks to communicate with each other.</p><p>Let's say you have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> account. You can send and receive anything from another phone using a Verizon account across Verizon's network, as long as both parties are in Verizon's service area.</p><p>If you're talking to someone on AT&T, or Orange or are outside of a normal Verizon service area (maybe you're vacationing) that traffic has to be routed across different networks so it can reach it's destination.</p><p>These interconnect providers use complicated routing and control software to make it happen. Some, such as Chinese state-owned networks China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom, CITIC Telecom, and PCCW Global Hong Kong, play a dominant role in routing all this traffic and use software and protocols that are severely outdated and unsafe.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5" name="5g-icon.jpg" alt="5G icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oNDxSFD4PGf89pXaFeweb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>None of this is speculation. There are multiple real-world examples of how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.firstpoint-mg.com/blog/ss7-attack-guide/" target="_blank">SS7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diameter_(protocol)" target="_blank">Diameter</a>, the unsafe network signaling protocols in question, have been exploited. A group with the ability to exploit this software can access authentication data, SMS messages, location updates, and internet traffic in either real-time for active threats or store it for passive threats.</p><p>You probably aren't a high-value target, yet your data is potentially being stored so it can one day be used against you.</p><p>The report also states how this makes it trivial for Chinese government-sponsored hacking groups to operate, but there is no proof given; an attacker can be anywhere in the world and gain access. These companies may be controlled by the Chinese state, but they could also be victims in all this. Victims with the means to make a change, though.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Your data is potentially being stored so it can one day be used against you.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The United States stopped considering Chinese interconnect providers as trusted under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/4998" target="_blank">Secure Networks Act</a> so US outbound traffic isn't routed through any of the companies in question. But if you're talking to someone in say, South Korea, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/15/revealed-china-suspected-of-spying-on-americans-via-caribbean-phone-networks" target="_blank">the Bahamas</a>, or even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-is-five-eyes-intelligence-sharing-alliance-2025-03-06/" target="_blank">Five-Eye intelligence</a> member nation New Zealand anything they send to you might be.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-all-this-mean-for-me-2">What does all this mean for me?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="H6wA3Mii7oXhgLqNdhPGfF" name="android-encryption-adoption-google-io-2017.jpg" alt="Android encryption adoption" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6wA3Mii7oXhgLqNdhPGfF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>That's the easy part, which is great.</p><p>This means you should never be sending anything to anyone unless it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-end-end-encryption-google-messages-app" target="_blank">end-to-end encrypted</a>. Doing so might mean anyone can take a look at it.</p><p>This means <em>everything</em>. Your messages, your bank data, and especially those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-time-stop-using-services-force-you-use-sms-based-two-factor-authentication">SMS 2FA codes</a> from companies that do not care about your security enough to use an alternative authentication method. Like my bank (and probably yours, too).</p><p>I know I'm not important enough, nor do I have enough money for any big hacking group to care about me. The fact is, you are probably the same. That doesn't mean we shouldn't care; one day, I may win Mega-Millions or be elected President.</p><p>We can only do what we can, when we can. The real enablers of this sort of mess will do whatever they please.</p>

<ul><li>Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are beginning to receive an update, which brings Spotify capabilities, as well as Apple Music and Shazam, to more places.</li><li>The glasses AI grabs more natural, "lifelike" voices while its capabilities for real-world insights expands to the U.K.</li><li>Earlier this year, Meta announced that its Ray-Ban glasses have crossed 2 million units sold, and there are plans to increase its production to 10 million by 2026.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Owners of Meta's smart glasses are in for an end-of-the-week treat as the company rolls in a patch full of additions.</p><p>Update v14.1 for the Ray-Ban Meta glasses was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich earlier today (Apr. 17). The update focuses on the smart glasses' apps and AI software. To start, Meta states Ray-Ban is picking up the ability to "play music and shuffle by artist, albums, and playlists" via Spotify.</p><p>With this, users are receiving two important voice commands: "shuffle my (X) playlist" and "repeat this song."</p><p>Each of these can be kick-started with "Hey Meta" once the patch is installed. Spotify is available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban smart glasses</a> for English users in the U.K., Canada, Australia, France, Italy, Spain, Ireland, Austria, Belgium, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Norway. Meta is also expanding its "connected apps," such as Apple Music and Shazam in conjunction with Spotify, to the previously listed regions.</p><p>Meta AI on the smart glasses can now interpret queries about weather, air quality, and the UV index via voice commands. The latest v14.1 patch for the Ray-Ban glasses includes a few AI updates, which can be seen below.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Updated Voices: </strong>Meta AI Voices have been updated to sound more natural and lifelike. Users can navigate to <strong>Meta AI Settings > Voice </strong>to select a voice for the software to use.</li><li><strong>Meta AI expands to the U.K.: </strong>Users can learn about the history of landmarks while walking or get recipe suggestions based on the content in their home.</li></ul>

<p>Meta dropped the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">most futuristic AI update</a> for the Ray-Ban smart glasses right before the holidays in December. The patch concerned Early Access program members, as the company delivered Live Record and Live Translate. The former allows the Ray-Ban glasses to record what you see and offer AI-powered insights without users needing to say "Hey Meta" aloud.</p><p>Members could also interrupt the AI or ask a follow-up question after it gives its response. Live Translate is pretty straightforward; users can hear or read the response of a person speaking another language via the glasses' speaker or their phones.</p><p>More importantly, since launching in 2023, Meta's Ray-Ban glasses seem to be a hit after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">having sold 2 million units</a> since then. To celebrate, EssilorLuxottica announced that it's looking to increase mass production of the device to 10 million units by 2026. Additionally, it seems both companies are betting big on these smart glasses. While Meta has already started a huge smart glasses push, even grabbing some top tanked celebrities to showcase it, there are rumors that the next generation will feature a built-in display.</p><p>The display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-ray-ban-meta-ar-glasses-are-getting-a-visual-upgrade">might be tiny</a>, but it would alleviate the need for users to reach for their phones or rely solely on the Ray-Ban speaker for info.</p>

What really stands out is the gains made by budget phones; devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">Nothing Phone 3a</a> showcase just what's possible when brands pay attention to the budget category. <br><br>Similarly, mid-range phones have never been better, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> delivering standout cameras and powerful hardware. At the other end of the scale is the Galaxy A56; Samsung's latest mid-ranger has incremental upgrades, and while it looks a little different to its predecessor, it has the same foibles. In a year of strong options, the Galaxy A56 is the worst mid-range phone on sale today.</p>

<p>Samsung never really offered a strong hardware package with its A series devices, instead positioning these phones as "all-rounders." As such, the Exynos 1580 on the Galaxy A56 is considerably slower than other mid-range phones, and this is immediately evident when you push the hardware — it just doesn't do a good job with gaming, and I noticed some lag after a week of use even with the optimized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>.</p><p>I was holding out for Samsung to make considerable changes in this area. That isn't the case, and the A56 continues to be just as middling as its predecessors — the hardware just isn't good enough for a phone that costs $499. The one positive change is that the panel gets brighter, and it does a good job with HDR content. However, it doesn't get as bright as the Nord 4 or the Phone 3a Pro in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nMaTPvcZ4quZrFxjVsRJri" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nMaTPvcZ4quZrFxjVsRJri.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another uptick has to do with the visual aesthetic; Samsung tweaked the design at the back, introducing an oblong camera island that looks clean. The phone has a metal mid-frame and glass back, and has a better in-hand feel than some of its predecessors. You also get Samsung Knox, and there's IP67 ingress protection. <br><br>Samsung is doubling down on AI, so the A56 gets Best Face, Instant Slo-mo, and auto-trim features. However, you don't get the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite of utilities — you'll need to buy the Galaxy S25 series to unlock the extras. Google did a much better job porting over most of its AI utilities into the Pixel 9a, and if you're ready to dive into AI-assisted features, that's the mid-range phone I recommend.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FSZcF4PbkALVcsphi8BG4j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FSZcF4PbkALVcsphi8BG4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy A56 has the same 5000mAh battery as last year, and counter to every other phone I tested in 2025, the battery doesn't last as long as its predecessor. I still got a day's worth of use at times, but push the device to any extent, and you'll need to plug it in before the night's out. <br><br>Samsung switched to 45W charging, but it still takes the A56 well over 75 minutes to charge the battery, and it is one of the slowest-charging mid-range phones around — only the Pixel 9a takes longer. Samsung doesn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide battery tech</a> either, and that means yet another year where the A56 doesn't quite measure up to its rivals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dChAPA7iQCT9NEVUyPyy3j" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dChAPA7iQCT9NEVUyPyy3j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the cameras; the phone has a good selfie camera, and while there's no autofocus, it does a decent enough job in well-lit scenarios. The main 50MP camera proved to be inconsistent, and the quality of the images I got out of the device just didn't hold up with other mid-rangers. Similarly, the auxiliary cameras just aren't worth the bother, and Samsung really needs to take a page out of Nothing's playbook and focus on delivering two great cameras on its devices. <br><br>I shared these findings with a Samsung India representative, and was told that the brand jotted down the feedback and would get back to me if there's anything to share. Considering my previous interactions with Samsung over the years, I doubt anything would come of it.</p>

<p>Having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-a7-2016-review-close-no-cigar">tested all Galaxy A series devices</a> going back to the original Galaxy A5, and A7, I'd like to think that I have a decent understanding of Samsung's mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Galaxy A portfolio</a>. In recent years, the brand started to rest on its laurels, basically rehashing the same device with little to no changes. That allowed its Chinese rivals to catch up, and with the Galaxy A56, we're at a point where it doesn't make any sense to buy the device when there are much better alternatives available. <br><br>I know that a big allure with Samsung's phones is the familiar software, but even with One UI 7, the phone just doesn't do enough to justify its $499 asking price. While Samsung didn't have much in the way of rivalry in the U.S., that isn't the case now — the Pixel 9a and OnePlus 13R deliver a better experience in just about every area, and they cost the same as the A56. If you're outside North America, you should consider taking a look at the POCO X7 Pro or the Nord 4 in addition to the aforementioned devices.</p><p>Even if you're a long-term Samsung user, I encourage you to take a look at some of the alternatives before considering the A56. Samsung has proven time and again that it doesn't care about delivering meaningful changes to its mid-range phones, and the A56 does a great job highlighting the brand's deficiencies in 2025.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Synology makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">best Plex NAS servers</a>, and I've used its products for over a decade now. While the brand doesn't have class-leading hardware, its software suite continues to be the best in the industry, and its NAS servers have been reliable. Currently, I use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+ as my main NAS</a>, housing over 140TB of data, and I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/synology-diskstation-ds1621xs-plus-review">DS1621xs+</a> as a secondary NAS containing over 80TB of data. <br><br>Synology had a quiet 2024, but the brand is gearing up to launch its 2025 portfolio soon. But when the new Plus series models come out, there will be a significant limitation: these DiskStation models will be compatible with Synology's first-party drives, and not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> from Seagate and Western Digital. <br><br>Synology started enforcing this on its business-centric NAS models back in 2021 — which is incidentally when it introduced its own drives — but it mentioned at the time that the move <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-why-synology-switched-validated-disks-enterprise-nas-enclosures">wouldn't affect the consumer DiskStation series</a>. But at the same time, the brand significantly reduced the number of eligible third-party IronWolf and WD Red models, and now it is entirely walking back earlier claims and limiting its DiskStation Plus series to its own drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wFfV2S93G9cnKhm4nsqB5Y" name="diskstation-ds1823xs-plus-26.jpg" alt="DiskStation DS1823xs+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wFfV2S93G9cnKhm4nsqB5Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.synology.com/de-de/company/news/article/DACH_VL_plus/Synology%20setzt%20f%C3%BCr%20kommende%20Plus-Modelle%20verst%C3%A4rkt%20auf%20das%20eigene%20%C3%96kosystem">press release</a> (in German): "For users, this means that starting with the Plus series models released in 2025, only Synology’s own hard drives and third-party hard drives certified according to Synology’s specifications will be compatible and offer the full range of functions and support." <br><br>The brand notes that this is only valid with Plus models debuting in 2025 and later, so the existing portfolio consisting of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DS224+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">DS723+</a>, and all other models are unaffected. Synology also noted that migrating drives from an existing NAS to a 2025 Plus server won't incur any restrictions: "There will be no changes for Plus models released up to and including 2024 (excluding the XS Plus series and rack models). Furthermore, migrating hard drives from existing Synology NAS to a new Plus model will continue to be possible without restrictions."<br><br>Basically, if you use anything other than a Synology-branded hard drive in the 2025 DiskStation Plus models, you won't be able to use key features like volume-wide deduplication, lifespan analysis, and automatic hard drive firmware updates. Synology says it is making this change to "reduce compatibility issues and increase system reliability," but the real reason has to do with money — the brand would rather you buy its own drives instead of Seagate and WD's products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="m2KSqM62VcWZvFxWpeE3c" name="diskstation-ds923-plus-review-6.jpg" alt="Synology DiskStation DS923+ review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m2KSqM62VcWZvFxWpeE3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>In a statement, Synology said that it conducted 7,000 hours of rigorous testing with its own hard drives in conjunction with the upcoming DiskStation Plus models, and that in general it saw a "20% reduction in support tickets related to storage and drive issues when using Synology’s HDDs." <br><br>It is understandable that the brand is trying to provide a tighter integration between its drives and NAS servers, but the choice should ultimately be made by the user. As someone who uses Seagate's IronWolf and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">Exos drives</a> extensively alongside Toshiba and WD Red HDDs, I don't want to be shoehorned into selecting just one drive. <br><br>I've always recommended Synology NAS servers for their robust feature-set and ease of use, but this deliberate user-hostile move has me rethinking that decision. I'll await judgement until I get my hands on the Plus models (they're debuting shortly), but as an enthusiast, I can't help but feel that Synology is abandoning its loyal userbase just to eke out additional profits.</p>

In response to the May 2 deadline, Retroid moved <em>up</em> the timeline for shipping the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic</a>. Preorders for the Flip 2 began shipping earlier this week, with Retroid ramping up shipments for the Pocket Classic just yesterday.</p><p>Even with the Hongkong Post halting any shipments from China to the U.S., we assumed "no news was good news." It turns out that's not the case, as an announcement was made on X (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/6HdBbH88Tj">Retroid Discord</a>) that the Kiwi, Teal, and Berry colors will not arrive in time to be shipped. The announcement also explains that "All shipping agencies will not accept US-bound packages from China, starting 4/25/25."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on RP Classic shipping to US customers: pic.twitter.com/nHCnnpq5OO<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1912862898168213798">April 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>I wasn't personally aware of the 4/25 cutoff date for shipments between the two countries. However, it doesn't come as much of a surprise given the hostile nature of the situation. Nevertheless, this doesn't bode well for anyone, not just those who preordered the Retroid Pocket Classic. For now, the only recourse we have is to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/pages/about-us">contact Retroid</a> and request a different color, but who knows how long it will be before those supplies dry up.</p><p>If anything, it's a sign of things to come, meaning that even if you were willing to pay the tariff fees for a product, that decision has been taken out of your hands entirely. Instead, the package will either not be accepted at all or will be returned to the sender if it manages to slip through the cracks.</p>

<p>Sure, it's just a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>, which is confined to a niche anyway. But the bigger question weighing on my mind now is how this will affect 2025 smartphone launches. Practically every phone passes through China at some point, even if it's just for the manufacturing of certain components before going to a factory in Vietnam, India, or elsewhere to be included in the assembly.</p><p>Currently, it doesn't appear that other countries are affected, indicating a good chance that this won't impact upcoming device releases. That may not be the case across the board, so it's possible that some devices are delayed or perhaps even outright canceled. And if you don't think phone makers are concerned about what could be on the horizon, look no further than Apple.</p>

<p>Recently, a report surfaced claiming that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/09/apple-stock-tariffs-china-iphones" target="_blank">Apple has flown</a> "at least 10 flights carrying iPhones and other products" from China, in an effort to avoid the tariff wars. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-users-rush-to-upgrade-iphones-ahead-of-potential-tariffs-related-price-hikes-7640aa24" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>, there are "throngs of U.S. consumers who have rushed to buy new iPhones over the past week, expecting that new tariffs will prompt Apple to raise prices."</p><p>Another report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://macmagazine.com.br/post/2025/04/16/brasil-faz-parte-da-linha-de-producao-do-iphone-16e/" target="_blank">suggests</a> that Apple is relocating the manufacturing of the iPhone 16e to Brazil, a country not affected by the tariff disputes between the U.S. and China. While we haven't seen similar reports about devices from Samsung or Google, we also wouldn't be surprised if they start to appear in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Shortly after Apple loaded up ten planes of products, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">Trump Administration announced</a> that "smartphones and other electronics components will be exempt" from the tariffs. All of this came after companies like Razer and Framework halted shipments of certain devices to the U.S. Meanwhile, other companies, such as Lenovo with the forthcoming Legion Go S, and OnePlus with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">Watch 3</a>, raised prices in an attempt to "get ahead" of the storm.</p><p>Meanwhile, the majority of Android gaming handhelds are completely designed and manufactured in China. And upon release, it's a DHL or 4PX shipment that might get transferred to USPS before landing on your doorstep. And while Retroid is the one being currently affected, there are other gaming handhelds from the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">AYANEO</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">OneXSugar</a> that are expected to be released in the near future.</p>

<p>Given that shipping agencies will apparently no longer be accepting packages, it could spell disaster for some of these companies. Alternatively, it may mean that your package needs to make a stop in a different country before it can be delivered to your front door. The logistics of that idea alone are enough to give me the heebie-jeebies, so I don't even want to imagine what it would actually be like.</p><p>The craziest part about the entire situation isn't the back-and-forth between the U.S. and China. It's just how fluid everything is, and that by this time tomorrow, another frustrating layer is peeled back. Hell, it could just all be gone, and we go back to the way things were before January. Sadly, I don't think that's going to be in the cards.</p>

<p>Google says that its Wear OS 5.1 update makes the Pixel Watch 3 and previous models much better at handling "challenging" step count tracking, like pushing a stroller or shopping cart. I put this new system to the test.</p><p>Google's Wear OS 5.1 community post states that the "improved algorithm ensures your steps are counted with exceptional accuracy" in scenarios where you're not freely swinging your wrist with each step, such as walking with hiking poles or holding a phone. That can be a challenge for any smartwatch.</p><p>My Pixel Watch 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">didn't receive the update for a month</a>, but after the Pixel Watch team manually added mine to their update list, I took it out for some monotonous step tests. I rolled a cart through each grocery store aisle, hiked a trail with trekking poles, and took my dad's walker around the house — all while counting every actual step to compare.</p><p>Then I closed things off by conducting a straightforward walking test using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review" target="_blank">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, as Garmin is almost always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/step-counting-accuracy-test" target="_blank">the most accurate brand for step count</a>. Here are the results!</p>

<h2 id="how-well-the-new-pixel-watch-3-step-count-algorithm-works-2">How well the new Pixel Watch 3 step count algorithm works</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="FLMYnEWEzKspLHzsWVEWpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-step-count" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 on a wrist showing the Steps Tile, with 10,619 steps (Goal met)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLMYnEWEzKspLHzsWVEWpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In past checks, my Fitbit or Pixel Watch models weren't especially accurate for step count, typically falling short of the mark. So, besides "challenging" scenarios, I wanted to see if this new algorithm would catch normal steps, too.</p><p>Since many people aim to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-walked-10000-steps-a-day-for-one-month" target="_blank">walk 10,000 steps a day</a>, I used the Pixel Watch 3 and Garmin Fenix 8 to track 10,000 steps, tapping my simple counting app every 10 steps until I reached the 1,000 mark. I held the phone on my Garmin side to make sure the Pixel Watch 3 would swing naturally.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 ended at 9,896 (104 steps short), while the Garmin Fenix 8 ended at 10,050 (50 steps extra). Garmin performed better, as I expected, though frankly, it usually does a little better than that.</p><p>While the Pixel Watch 3 lost the step-count battle, my past Pixel Watch 2 and Fitbit Sense 2 tests have ranged from 200–300 steps off across 5,000 steps. Proportionally, the accuracy gap isn't as wide as it once was, which you can possibly attribute to the algorithm change.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-vs-Garmin-Fenix-8-steps" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Garmin Fenix 8 (right), both showing their respective step counts of 11,442 and 11,747." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qiyo4WfeEBRQGJxhhJczpj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In another test, I walked 8,000 steps while holding a trekking pole on the same side as my Pixel Watch 3. Because you take 4–6 steps for every single motion of the walking stick, it's easy for the step count to fall well short. I was curious if the algorithm could fix that.</p><p>I ended up measuring 7,857, or 143 steps short. Funnily enough, instead of the usual auto-detected walk activity, it asked me if I was using an elliptical near the end of the walk, because of the consistent rounded motion of my arm.</p><p>While the results were slightly less accurate than unimpeded walking, I did notice that I was 90 steps short after 2,000 steps, but then only lost 50 steps for the remaining 6,000. I wonder if the Watch got better at figuring out my walking pattern over time. Meanwhile, my Garmin watch inflated my step count to about 8,300, which I attribute to holding my phone in that hand. Still, not the best result!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="C3X6X7hb9zamThx4XVPjV9" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-miles.jpeg" alt="A post-workout graphic showing 7.63 miles completed on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C3X6X7hb9zamThx4XVPjV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for walking with a shopping cart, I had a little bit of trouble keeping exact count of my steps while looking at deal prices and stepping around other customers. But what I can tell you is that the Pixel Watch 3 was either dead-on at counting my steps... or couldn't detect them.</p><p>Mime walking with a shopping cart, and you'll see the problem. If you move forward normally, your wrists won't bend, and your arms stay fixed; there's nothing for the algorithm to work with. So I'd walk 100 steps, look down, and see that both Fitbit and Garmin had only caught a couple of dozen steps, or none at all.</p><p>However, when I increased my pace, walking up and down the aisles without slowing, both watches could detect my rolling gait more easily. After 200 steps, the Watch 3 ended up with almost exactly that number added.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Pixel Watch 3 and Fenix 8 measured 742 and 745 steps, respectively. My actual count was at least a couple hundred steps higher, but I just appreciated that they caught anything at all. With other brands, you may only get a few hundred steps total after spending an hour in the store.</p>
<h2 id="a-step-in-the-right-direction-2">A step in the right direction</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-and-Android-statue.jpeg" alt="An Android statue wearing a headband and a dummy Pixel Watch 3, standing behind a display of Pixel Watch 3s." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fPpvjgpUCN64ZdtqTgkJyP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Wear OS 5.1 algorithm also includes better wheelchair tracking and stroller tracking, though I couldn't test either.</p><p>My guess is that stroller and shopping cart tracking will be pretty similar: If you drift along slowly, the Watch 3 won't catch your movement, but walk fast and there'll be enough subtle vertical motion for the algorithm to catch.</p><p>As for wheelchair pushes, that's a significant and consistent motion — like walking with a trekking pole — so I'd assume the Watch 3 will catch most of them, even if it falls slightly short.</p><p>I felt awkward testing my dad's walker for more than a couple of minutes — it felt too much like I was feigning a disability — but in that time, the Watch 3 had no trouble recognizing my steps. It might not do as well if you have a shuffling gait, however.</p><p>Overall, even if I wouldn't say the Pixel Watch 3 quite lives up to the "exceptional accuracy" claim in Google's blog post, it does decently in scenarios where other smartwatches would struggle to register steps, including Garmin. And I certainly appreciate the effort!</p>

<p>It was a surreal sensation and one that I wasn't expecting when I tried out the Woojer Haptic Vest 3 haptic vest for the first time. What started out as wonderment quickly turned into a minor addiction. What other games might deliver such tactile feedback, and what games would feel very different because of it?</p><p>A haptic vest like the Woojer Haptic Vest 3 allowed me to feel every blast, every shot, and to better understand the physical makeup of the virtual world I visit weekly when I play Breachers with friends. I've had a Woojer vest for a while, but never got around to using it regularly. Now I'm kicking myself for missing out on so many great moments that would have otherwise been even better with this haptic vest.</p><p>However, Woojer isn't limited to virtual reality, and it's not just designed for games created explicitly for it. Woojer's fascinating haptic technology works by funneling sound into a processor, which is specially coded to turn that sound into vibration. In a rudimentary sense, it's like wearing a full-body subwoofer, and it works for any game you play, movie you watch, or even the music you listen to; it quickly became my go-to peripheral for any gaming-related activity this month.</p>

<h2 id="what-the-heck-is-a-haptic-vest-anyway-2">What the heck is a haptic vest, anyway?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="45b3GoaG57vpVQoQYbjgoX" name="woojer-series-3-wearing-01" alt="Wearing a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 and a Meta Quest 3 with OnePlus Buds 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/45b3GoaG57vpVQoQYbjgoX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you've been gaming as long as I have, you might remember the first time you used a controller with rumble in it. For me, it was Star Fox 64, which came with a rumble pack in the box. It clicked into the Nintendo 64's controller and delivered the most immersive experience I'd ever had up until that moment. Suddenly, my hands could feel all the bombs going off in the game, the buildings falling around me as I evaded them, and every painful hit from the final boss.</p><p>A haptic vest takes that experience and transfers it to your entire torso, delivering a haptic experience you simply have to try. I was skeptical of this experience at first because Woojer's design differs from that of other haptic vests, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bhaptics.com/en/" target="_blank">bHaptics</a>, which require specific coding in games. That means Woojer's haptic experience isn't better or worse than the competition; it's simply different.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>A haptic vest takes the idea of controller rumble or haptics and elevates the experience by adding them to your whole torso.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you're curious about the differences, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aXbKo501NY">here's a great video</a> that illustrates how a bHaptics vest feels specifically in Breachers. The vest and its accompanying wrist accessories will vibrate when you shoot a gun, grab an object, or get shot yourself. It'll also vibrate specific parts of the vest if a grenade goes off near you, helping to simulate things you come in direct contact with.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj" name="woojer-series-3-app-main-screen" alt="The Woojer app with a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/32CMByQaLeiora4S67tJQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To an extent, the Woojer vest also does that, but Woojer's take is more about environmental feel rather than specific body feel. When I shoot a gun while wearing the Woojer, I feel the power of it.</p><p>But I also feel the subtle rumble from a grenade that went off on the other side of the room, and the low rumble of a wall being blasted open a few rooms over feels palpably realistic, too. The bHaptics vest doesn't deliver that because it's not really designed for that, which is fine. I'm not knocking bHaptics, just trying to illustrate the difference.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Woojer's sound-based model allowed me to feel environmental sounds as much as ones that directly impact me as a player.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The more general nature of Woojer's design also means that you feel intense music in a way that feels almost like marching to a war drum. I was playing Monster Hunter Wilds through GeForce Now on my phone while hooked up to my Woojer Haptic Vest 3 vest, and I felt every pounding drum in the music. It felt exciting and lent a depth to the audio that previously wasn't there.</p><p>It's proof that Woojer's experience isn't just confined to virtual reality games, and it works just as well for movies. I recently watched a fan cut of The Hobbit with some friends in Bigscreen VR — a virtual theater experience where you can hang out with friends and watch movies or videos, all while wearing a VR vest. It made me feel like I was sitting in one of those "4D" chair experiences some theaters have, but I didn't have to leave my house to get it.</p>
<h2 id="how-woojer-s-tech-works-and-what-it-s-best-for-2">How Woojer's tech works and what it's best for</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KRfMQZvR7PbDsc9H6QBym" name="woojer-series-3-wearing-connections" alt="The control panel on the front of a Woojer Haptic Vest 3 with a 3.5mm input cable connected" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KRfMQZvR7PbDsc9H6QBym.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Woojer vest's haptic motors operate entirely on sound. You can pipe the sound in either through a 3.5mm cable or via a wireless Bluetooth connection. From there, you'll need to select an audio output, and you'll have the same options: 3.5mm audio cable or Bluetooth.</p><p>That means your audio source — whether it's your Meta Quest 3 headset, your phone, or a gaming console — connects to the vest, and then your vest connects to your earbuds, headphones, or speakers. As you might expect, the 3.5mm cable option requires no configuration at all, while Bluetooth is best set up with the Woojer app.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>An audio source (headset, console, phone) connects to the vest, which then connects to a pair of earbuds or speakers.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The Woojer vest features its own battery pack, located on the back, which lasts approximately 8 hours on a single charge. The vest connects to the Woojer app on your phone, so as long as you're using the app, you should always be aware of how much battery is left. This app also gives you control over audio sources and output, so you can specify which earbuds your audio outputs to.</p>

<p>As you might expect, Bluetooth audio introduces some latency, but I didn't find this to be a problem even when playing VR games. The obvious reason for this is that haptic feedback is less important to your brain than visual or audio cues, particularly in VR, so a slight delay of 1/10th of a second from the action to the feeling won't make you feel sick or anything like that. In fact, I wasn't even aware of the delay until I pulled up the app and saw the gauge.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The ability to use both 3.5mm cables and Bluetooth ensured I had a great experience no matter what audio equipment was available.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Part of the reason is that the app has several different modes that you can choose from to ensure you get the right experience. The VR gaming setting, for instance, strips away as much processing as possible to reduce latency. Setting it to gaming also helps reduce the amount of vibration caused by music, leaving most of the feeling to actions in the game rather than arbitrary rumbling to the beat.</p><p>These settings are crucial for the best experience, and while you certainly can operate the vest without the app, you'll be missing out on a lot by avoiding it.</p>

<p>Haptic intensity and volume can be adjusted either on the vest's control panel, located in the location of a typical shirt pocket on the front of the vest, or via the Woojer app on the phone. The default haptic intensity is rather comfortable for me, but I've shown the vest off to some people who wanted to jack it up to get some extra feeling.</p><p>Turning the intensity up too high will trigger a vibration on nearly everything the vest "hears." If for no other reason, I don't recommend using it at maximum vibration because it rattles too much and ends up responding to things you don't necessarily want, like music.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Preset latency options in the Woojer app make it possible to easily switch functions without any real configuration.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The vest itself is rather soft and comfortable, and while it certainly adds a bit of weight to your torso, this doesn't feel like wearing a weighted vest at the gym. The material is quite breathable, but it will make you sweat a bit more during warm weather. In the winter, it feels particularly nice. Woojer sells some nice, breathable (and rather cool-looking) washable linings <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/woojer-vest-3-washable-lining-apex-hunter/6563853.p?skuId=6563853">for about $30</a> if sweat becomes a problem.</p>

<p>That brings me to the types of games you'll want to use the vest for. You could use it for anything and everything, but I've found that games with specific tactile experiences work best.</p><p>Think rhythm games like Beat Saber or Beatable, where the vest will let you <em>feel</em> the music as much as hear it. This is one where low-latency audio is best, since a bit of lag in the haptics could actually throw off your rhythm.</p><p>Using the Woojer vest in shooters like Breachers or Contractors delivers a fascinating sense of immersion and environmental awareness that I didn't expect. I used the wall breaching analogy earlier, where I felt the explosion on the other side of the room and was able to more quickly spin around and understand where the explosion came from than when I wasn't wearing the vest.</p>

<p>Although it's a bit more work to strap on a vest and plug in before gaming, there's no chance I play most VR games without wearing the vest. Obviously, I'm not going to be strapping it on for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/walkabout-minigolf-meta-quest-mars-gardens">Walkabout Mini Golf</a> or strategy games like Civ VII VR, but everything else benefits immensely from the immersion factor of the vest.</p><p>I was skeptical going in, but Woojer made me a believer in its tech. Haptics enthusiasts and anyone seeking more immersion and spatial awareness in their games should definitely consider picking one up. That said, it is a fairly costly investment, comparable to the cost of a second Meta Quest 3S.</p>

<ul><li>A batch of "exclusive" information claims to have nailed what the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 will bring to the table.</li><li>It seems the device will upgrade its display to a 7-inch Super HD foldable screen with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite, and a 50MP selfie lens.</li><li>The phone could also sport a much larger battery with souped up wired charging.</li><li>Motorola's official teasers state the Razr 2025 series will debut on April 24.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Another wave of leaks about Motorola's next top-level foldable has come to light, hinting at its potential upgrades.</p><p>Alleged "exclusive" information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-razr-60-ultra-specifications-leak-exclusive/">91Mobiles</a> with X tipster OnLeaks claims the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 (Razr 60 Ultra internationally) could see a few hardware changes. One of the major changes is the swap for Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC</a>, which would give the Razr a huge power boost if true. Additional purported upgrades are seemingly minimal and could affect its internal screen.</p><p>The publication suggests consumers could see a slightly bigger 7-inch Super HD foldable screen. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">previous model</a> offered a 6.9-inch pOLED screen, so the change might be worth it if true.</p><p>Other rumored changes include the foldable's front-facing selfie camera. The tipster's information alleges the Razr Plus 2025 could jump to a 50MP lens instead of the same 32MP, f/2.4 lens that its predecessor provides. While these are more "in your face," speculation continues for the phone's power supply.</p><p>A larger 4,7000mAh battery could find its way into the foldable. This is reportedly paired with 68W wired fast charging (a huge boost) and 30W wireless charging capabilities.</p>

<p>The supposed specifications suggest the next Razr Plus could continue to offer its larger 4-inch cover display with a 165Hz refresh rate, as last year's. The Razr is also expected to keep its 50MP primary and ultrawide-angle lenses. Moreover, consumers will likely see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> during its setup.</p><p>We've seen some of these alleged specifications mentioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-motorola-razr-2025-series-leaks-again">in a previous leak</a>, so perhaps there's some merit to them. One thing that stood out earlier in April was the supposed color options for consumers. Consumers can potentially expect a revamped red option, as well as a dark green faux leather and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked">a wood finish</a>. What's more, tipsters at the time speculate the company will pack even more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> into its next foldable — and its base model — than we've seen before.</p><p>You might've received the emails, too, but Motorola has already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">started teasing</a> its next foldable launch on social media. Though brief, we were given a glimpse at three Razrs unfolding in various colors. Each model gave us a look at a different color, but the most important bit was the date: April 24.</p><p>We're just a week away from Motorola's grand reveal of the Razr 2025 series.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Good Lock launcher for Galaxy devices has appeared on the Play Store.</li><li>This signals its global release, which also comes with a complete redesign.</li><li>Samsung alerted users to Good Lock's impending redesign/global availability in January, and it seems the rollout coincides with its One UI 7 release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's launcher for Galaxy has been spotted sporting its new design down the global runway.</p><p>Good Lock's global availability was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samsung.android.goodlock&hl=en_US">on the Play Store</a> this week, coinciding with Samsung's One UI 7 update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/samsung-good-lock-play-store-release-global/">9to5Google</a>). Additionally, a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/the-wait-is-over-good-lock-is-finally-available-globally/">SamMobile</a> confirms the launcher's availability for more countries globally via the Galaxy Store. While the Play Store doesn't get too in-depth about its complete redesign, it gives us a glimpse of its refreshed main plug-in page.</p><p>The launcher breaks things down to give users quick access to "Extensions" and device "Gestures" in small bubbles. Beneath that is a complete list of available plug-ins, which seems to have remained similar to its previous iteration. The plug-ins page now offers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> name with the "Your Galaxy Your Way" tagline in a purple-to-pink gradient banner.</p><p>The "You" tab features more of the same refreshments with defined "Favorites" and "Settings in Effect" categories.</p>

<p>Strangely, as 9to5 notes, the Play Store's Galaxy device compatibility is a little wonky. The store reportedly lacks mention of devices aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25</a> "when installing remotely." It's unclear if this is a visual bug. The post adds that the Galaxy S24 can download it, provided it is running One UI 7. The publication states it's tried to install the launcher on a Fold 6, but it's oddly "blocked."</p><p>Considering it's recent appearance, there's likely a few issues Samsung needs to sort out for its Galaxy devices globally. If you're encountering similar problems, it might be worth trying the launcher on the Galaxy Store instead.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">started preparing us</a> for a global Good Lock launch in January when it also highlighted its expected redesign. The company announced Good Lock would be available for "all countries" via the Play Store. A first for its Galaxy launcher. Users will find customization plug-ins like Home Up. In One UI 7, users can get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">pretty creative and wacky</a> with it, as one Reddit user discovered.</p><p>The Korean OEM pushed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">small QoL update</a> for the Good Lock in March. The patch cleaned up its "phrasing" while also altering the descriptions of a few features.</p>

<p>For a limited time, Best Buy is carving up to $150 off the price of the OnePlus 13 when you activate the phone through your carrier today. Easily one of the best Android phones on the market, the 13 is a sleek, versatile device with a revolutionary IP69 construction, lightning-fast processor, and one of the best displays we've ever seen on a smartphone. Deals on the flagship phone are very uncommon, so place your order before Best Buy's sale comes to a close on April 20th. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13-512gb-unlocked-black-eclipse/6609357.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="c1bb34be-07a8-4534-8f88-9764596d4935" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999.99" data-dimension48="$999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phone</a> on the market today, the OnePlus 13 boasts a sophisticated blend of top-of-the-line build quality with powerful specs.

Like I mentioned above, deals on the OnePlus 13 have been few and far between since the phone&apos;s release a few months back, so don&apos;t wait too long if you&apos;re interested. </p>

<p>Samsung's Android 15-based OS upgrade is reportedly returning for users in one region today (Apr. 17).</p><p>A post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1912799118511980610">X by Tarun Vats</a> is drawing awareness to One UI 7's rollout restart for the Galaxy S24 series (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-plus-ultra-one-ui-7-rollout-resumed/">SamMobile</a>). Users expecting the update globally may have to wait a while longer (still) as Vats states the build was spotted in South Korea. However, what users should look out for is build vS928NKSU4BYD9 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series whenever it hits your device.</p><p>Interestingly, the provided screenshot details the updated One UI 7 build is ~292MB. It's likely the smaller size will impact those who received the massive upgrade before Samsung's pause. The update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">originally launched</a> with a 5GB download, so this might jump slightly for those who never got it to begin with.</p><p>Of course, it's worth keeping your eyes peeled as we finish the week. With One UI 7's resuming in South Korea, it's likely global regions will see it in mid-April next week.</p>

<p>One UI 7's rollout <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">started on time</a> on April 10 for users in the U.S. and Europe for the Galaxy S24 series. Alongside the past-gen slab phone, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 were included, similar to how Samsung worked its rollout in Korea. However, Galaxy user excitement dwindled severely once the Korean OEM <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">paused the update</a> following a "serious bug."</p><p>Samsung pulled the patch four days later on April 14 after it identified a critical issue with its software. A tipster reported that the bug gave some Galaxy S24 users problems with unlocking their devices. Samsung not only suspended its rollout in the U.S. and Europe, but also in China and Vietnam, to name a couple more.</p><p>Samsung then informed Android Central it's been forced to update its One UI 7 rollout schedule to better reflect the times.</p><p>Speaking of, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/updated-one-ui-7-rollout-schedule">one person on Reddit</a> seems to have discovered what this new schedule could be, following a supposed Samsung Members app notification. The alert reportedly states One UI 7 should be available for the Galaxy S24, Flip 6, and Fold 6 in April. A few other older devices could begin seeing it in May.</p>
