While the Google Pixel Watch 3 is a fan favorite among Android users, it still pales in comparison to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS smartwatches</a> from Samsung and OnePlus in key areas.</p><p>That's why we're looking forward to the upcoming Google Pixel Watch 4, which aims to address some of these pain points, potentially bringing the smartwatch into true flagship territory. The Pixel Watch 4 hasn't been officially revealed yet, but early rumors and leaks give us an idea of what the next Google Watch might bring. Here's a speculative breakdown of how the Pixel Watch 4 might improve upon the Pixel Watch 3.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd" name="google-pixel-watch-3-porcelain-on-stands-2.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 41mm and 45mm with Porcelain bands" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zzk2VgCvX5nP2TDjAAb6jd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> is expected to launch alongside the Pixel 10 series, which will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">debut at an August 20 event</a>. For reference, the Pixel Watch 3 was announced on August 13, 2024, and became available as of September 10, 2024.</p><p>As for pricing, no current rumors or leaks point to a price change for the Pixel Watch 4. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/pixel-watch-4-on-vous-devoile-les-prix-en-euros-des-futures-montres-connectees-de-google-60260">a recent leak</a> suggests that the price will remain the same in Europe, which is good news. That would mean you'll pay $349 for a 41mm watch and $399 for a 45mm watch, with optional LTE versions costing another $100 on top of that. However, these prices are unconfirmed and could certainly rise due to inflation and other supply chain factors.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is currently available in two sizes: 41mm and 45mm, with prices starting at $349 and $399, respectively. Each size has three colorways: Matte Black and Polished Silver for both models, Champagne Gold as the 41mm exclusive, and Matte Hazel as the 45mm exclusive. The upgrade to cellular connectivity costs an extra $100.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-3-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 3: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">Leaked Google Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> might give us an early preview of Google's upcoming smartwatch. Put simply, the Pixel Watch 4 appears to have a questionable design, of these renders turn out to be accurate. They depict the Pixel Watch 4 as being about 2mm thicker than its predecessor, and without rear charging pins visible.</p><p>These design changes could be divisive among Pixel Watch fans. A positive of this change is that the Pixel Watch 4 could switch back to a wireless charging puck for power, rather than the contacts and pins on the Pixel Watch 3. On the flip side, this would mean that the Pixel Watch has changed charging methods three times in four generations, which isn't ideal for continuity.</p><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same "waterdrop" design language as its predecessors. This time, the bezels might be even slimmer, helping make the newer model feel more modern. If the case size remains roughly the same, we could see the Pixel Watch 4 displays slightly grow compared to the 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays on the Pixel Watch 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 3 measures 12.3mm thick, so if these rumors are true, the newer model could be close to 15mm thick. That certainly isn't great, because the current Pixel Watch 3 is actually on the thicker side of smartwatches already. The newly-announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> is only 8.6mm thick, and the Apple Watch Series 10 is only 9.7mm thick.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-03" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kA9jCwiZciKyJ5aav5AtKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, there will probably be more similarities than differences between the Google Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Watch 3.

As such, it's still possible we see the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 chip power the Pixel Watch 4, potentially bringing better speed, efficiency, and overall performance.</p><p>Even so, the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 has proven quite capable, and it wouldn't be a total loss if the Pixel Watch 4 retains this chip, as Google has been known to make the best of older chipsets in the past.</p><div ><table><caption>Rumored specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Specs</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4 (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Gold, Lemon, Porcelain, Iris, and Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Matte Hazel (45mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td><td  ><p>Active (fluoroelastomer)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown, possibly 14.3mm thick</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 41 x 12.3mm / 45 x 45 x 12.3mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight (w/out band)</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 31g; 45mm: 37g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight with small/large Active band</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 55g/63g; 45mm: 61g/69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td><td  ><p>1.27-inch (408x408) or 1.43-inch (456x456) Actua AMOLED LTPO display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>2,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>2,000 nits, 60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade), GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (upgrade), GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td><td  ><p>Multi-path optical HR sensor, red & IR sensors for SpO2, multipurpose electrical (ECG), electrical skin conductance for body response (cEDA), skin temperature, accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, barometer, compass, gyroscope, magnetometer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/420mAh</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh/420mAh, 24 hours with AOD, 36 hours with Battery Saver</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>41mm: 24 minutes to 50%, 35 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%; 45mm: 28 minutes to 50%, 50 minutes to 80%, 80 minutes to 100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>CPU</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 (1.7GHz), Cortex M33 co-processor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory / Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB + 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 5 (3 years of updates)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Other than that, we expect the Pixel Watch 4 to feature the same fitness and health sensors as the Pixel Watch 3.

I took it personally when Samsung estimated that I had "Low" antioxidants, so I spent the past week eating as healthily as possible to see if it made a difference.</p><p>Samsung's multicolored health sensors look for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.healthline.com/health/carotenoids">carotenoids</a>, the pigment that gives fruits and veggies their bright red, orange, or yellow coloring; once in your body, they counterbalance the "oxidative stress" generated from poor lifestyle habits like smoking, drinking, overeating, and stress. Hence the name "antioxidants."</p><p>Generally speaking, the antioxidant index is intended to determine whether you're consuming your WHO-recommended 400g of fruits and vegetables per day. For health-conscious individuals who dislike logging their food daily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 8</a> offers valuable context.</p><p>But since I thought I <em>was</em> eating healthily enough, I decided to cram carotenoid-rich foods into my diet for a week to see whether Samsung would be able to detect the changes properly.</p><h2 id="how-the-antioxidant-index-score-works-on-the-galaxy-watch-8-2">How the Antioxidant Index score works on the Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The BioActive sensor's multicolored LEDs that activate when measuring the antioxidant index. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your body stores carotenoids in the skin, where the Galaxy Watch 8's optical sensors can spot and measure them. Samsung told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/now-i-know-why-the-galaxy-8-watch-antioxidant-sensor-doesnt-use-your-wrist-and-its-so-obvious">TechRadar</a> that your wrist has too many capillaries, so your blood confuses the results; pressing your thumb against the sensor will "push away all the blood" and make it easier to check your carotenoid levels.</p><p>Carotenoids are just one type of antioxidant, but their pigmentation allows Samsung to detect them. We've emailed Samsung to ask if it might eventually track other antioxidants, but for now, carotenoids are the best estimate to check non-invasively if your body has other healthy vitamins and nutrients.</p><p>So, what foods have carotenoids? Samsung suggests <strong>root vegetables</strong> (carrots, sweet potatoes), <strong>leafy greens</strong> (spinach, kale), <strong>citrus fruits</strong> (oranges, mangoes), <strong>tomatoes</strong>, and <strong>bell peppers</strong>. Other carotenoid-rich foods include pumpkin, squash, cantaloupe, and corn; most red, orange, and yellow produce will likely have some.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung used data from clinical trials at Samsung Seoul Hospital to determine the "correlation between fruit and vegetable intake and the accumulation of carotenoids in the skin." Adequate antioxidant levels get a score of 75–100. People with "Low" scores (50–75) consume 50–99% of the recommended daily amount, so about a 2% increase per point. Very Low (0–49) is "less than 50%."</p><p>Samsung also warns that your score may fall during "periods of severe stress or when drinking or smoking," so it's about lifestyle as much as nutrition.</p><p>The company says it may change the criteria with "future clinical results," but the gist is that you want a score of 75 to match recommended levels. Everything above that is just gravy, while lower scores leave you vulnerable to "cell damage, excessive aging, inflammation, worsening eyesight, and chronic diseases such as cancer" over time.</p><h2 id="raising-my-antioxidant-index-score-on-my-galaxy-watch-8-2">Raising my Antioxidant Index score on my Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung warns that it can take "up to 2 weeks for your antioxidant index to reflect an increased intake of fruits and vegetables," so I knew that eating a boatload of carotenoids wouldn't instantly level me up. But I wanted to see if there was an obvious impact from a changed diet in the short term.</p><p>I stuck to my normal diet for the first day, and my reading stayed consistent. Starting on Monday, I raided my grocery store for carotenoid-rich fruits and veggies, then spent the next five days eating salads, bell peppers, cantaloupe, and other healthy produce, well above the recommended five servings per day.</p><p>My score did start to course-correct, but slowly. I looked into the benefits of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://now.tufts.edu/2024/09/30/benefits-raw-versus-cooked-vegetables">raw vs. cooked veggies</a> and realized that raw vegetables are high in vitamins and fiber but <em>low</em> in beta-carotenes. You get the most carotenoids from cooked vegetables paired with healthy fats, like cooking oil.</p><p>I'm more of a raw veggies guy than a stir-fry guy, which may be part of my problem. So I tried to incorporate more cooked veggies, paired with meats or peanut butter, during the final stretch.</p><div ><table><caption>My Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant index scores</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sunday</p></td><td  ><p>Monday</p></td><td  ><p>Tuesday</p></td><td  ><p>Wednesday</p></td><td  ><p>Thursday</p></td><td  ><p>Friday</p></td><td  ><p>Saturday</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>54</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>53</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>56</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>61</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td><td  ><p><strong>65</strong></p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>I climbed from an antioxidant index score of 53 (56% of recommended antioxidants) to 65 (80%) in a week. In theory, one more week of healthy eating will bring me to my target score of 75, on pace with Samsung's two-week estimate.</p><p>I can't quantify how accurate Samsung's antioxidant index is without a blood test, but this experience did, at least, show that this sensor isn't just some pseudoscientific guesstimate. It <em>can</em> tell that I'm eating healthier.</p><p>On the other hand, it feels demoralizing that my antioxidant index score has stalled out in the last few days, despite eating so healthily.</p><p>I <em>could</em> have cheated and taken dietary supplements to raise my score, but Samsung warns that these can have "harmful side effects" and "increase your risk for cancer and heart disease," so you and I should stick to the healthy-eating path.</p><h2 id="the-main-problem-with-samsung-s-antioxidant-index-2">The main problem with Samsung's antioxidant index</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KCsqGsAEzHqZyfmhBMFwXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KCsqGsAEzHqZyfmhBMFwXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> have food logging in their apps, but I dislike calorie-counting and having to quantify every meal. I <em>do</em> care about eating healthy, however, and only the Galaxy Watch 8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> have a tool like this, thanks to the BioActive sensor. I'm glad to have this tool as a baseline for my health.</p><p>Here's the main issue with the antioxidant index: there are more antioxidants than just carotenoids. Other types, such as flavonoids, polyphenols, and lycopene, are found in a wide range of fruits, vegetables, beans, and teas, and they all help remove the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/318652">"free radical" molecules</a> that contribute to aging and disease.</p><p>Carotenoids are a key indicator of your health, one that helped me recognize a dietary deficiency. However, since Samsung cannot track other non-pigmented antioxidants as easily, your <em>actual</em> "antioxidant score" might be higher than Samsung can accurately assess with a smartwatch.</p><p>But this isn't a criticism! It's merely a reminder that you shouldn't ignore the healthy foods that <em>don't</em> have carotenoids just because Samsung doesn't reward you for eating them.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a6ebbd75-6452-43b3-a6fe-3af50452b75e">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/watches/galaxy-watch8/buy/galaxy-watch8-44mm-graphite-wi-fi-bluetooth-sku-sm-l330ndaaxaa/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QfdvautZ3KdhiWYonQzJj5.jpg' alt="A render of the graphite Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 40mm smartwatch."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Get healthy</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 uses its BioActive sensor to track several new metrics, including your circadian rhythm for Bedtime Guidance, Vascular Load for heart health and stress, and the aforementioned antioxidant index.

We might not be able to afford the best, but we still would love to have it. But what is the best when you're talking about a phone?</p><p>You show me any list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a> and I can easily point out things that aren't the best. So can you. The reason for this is that there is no way one single thing can be best at everything; this especially applies to something as personal as a phone. This is why there are <em>lists</em>.</p><p>You hopefully enjoy the phone you have, and you'll definitely want to enjoy the next one you spend your hard-earned money on. It's something that we usually keep for a while, and being tied to something we don't like for a year or more isn't fun. That's why we search for "the best" before we spend it.</p><h2 id="i-can-t-tell-you-what-the-best-phone-is-2">I can't tell you what the best phone is</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-2" alt="The Motorola Razr 2025 half-opened with Apple Music playing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/72cNt9ST9BUNSBHvvtPkQB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I get a lot of questions from average consumers. I love this because, no matter how grumpy I may seem, I genuinely love helping people who are proactive enough to ask a question; the adage "<em>there are no bad questions</em>" is mostly true. Anyhoo, because I've been doing this for so long, people turn to me for the quick and easy answers sometimes. I'm not complaining — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ask-jerry">feel free to do the same</a>, and if I can help, I'll certainly try.</p><p>One question I get more than any other is what phone is the best on the market at any given time. I get it, many of us don't have a desire to live and breathe mobile technology, and the landscape changes so often that it can be difficult to keep up with it all, even for people who do it for a living.</p><p>The thing is, I can't answer that question. There is no best phone until you decide what you want it to be best at doing.</p><h2 id="best-at-what-2">Best at what?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The quick and easy (and often wrong) answers you'll find at the top of a lot of best phone lists right now are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. In a lot of ways, this is the right answer.</p><p>If you're looking at raw performance, hardware and software features, and especially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">ecosystem of complementary products</a>, both of these phones are better than the others. If this is what's important for you, all you would need to decide is whether you want an Android phone or an iPhone.</p><p>However, neither of these phones outperforms many other models in terms of other key needs, such as affordability, AI capabilities, or a unique form factor. When we here at Android Central call them the best, we mean best at the things listed above.</p><p>Say you'd rather not spend more than a thousand dollars on a phone and want to get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best value for your money</a>. Companies like Motorola and OnePlus offer phones that give you a lot to love at a much lower price. You can take this even further and look for the best phone you could buy for $500, and companies like Nothing or Xiaomi are great options. So are Samsung or OnePlus, which makes it a lot more difficult to decide.</p><p>Some criteria make it easier to determine a "best" model. You have a lot fewer choices when it comes to something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">a phone that folds or flips</a>. There are still enough models to keep going further down the rabbit hole, though.</p><h2 id="only-you-can-decide-what-s-best-2">Only you can decide what's best</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CpAFbmQPohmz4T2WXHhkAQ" name="oneplus-12r-5.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CpAFbmQPohmz4T2WXHhkAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you asked me which phone is best right now and forced me to give you an answer, I'd say the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>. It has a great price, it performs well, and it has a good set of features for its ~$500 price tag. But it's not the phone I bought.</p><p>That's because I wanted something most people probably don't care too much about — I need it to easily slip into my pocket while I'm tooling around in a wheelchair. For me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Moto Razr</a> was a better choice, even though I think the OnePlus is better in many ways. It folds down and doesn't smash up against the metal frame of my wheelchair. That was <em>more</em> important than a better camera or faster chip to me.</p><p>You have one or two things that are more important to you, just as I do. Maybe you want a cheap phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-camera-review">a camera that takes great photos</a> without much fiddling around with settings. Look at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>. Or if you want a phone you can fix yourself, you can't beat a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-launch">Fairphone 5</a>. Before you consider which phone is the best, you need to determine what you want it to excel at.</p><h2 id="ask-yourself-first-2">Ask yourself first</h2><p>We try to think about the things that apply to most people when writing our lists of which phones are the best. That's why we break it down into so many different categories. No one phone is the best at everything.</p><p>That means you should never blindly buy a phone based on ours or anyone else's recommendation. You need to ask yourself the harder questions first, and nobody knows the answer to them besides you. Then we can help :)</p> ]]></dc:content>

Compared to previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> I've used in the past, this is easily the best, thanks to its sleek design, smooth performance, and surprisingly decent battery life. Yet, while the Fitbit integration is a nice perk of owning a Pixel Watch, there's one niche feature that keeps it from being my go-to gym smartwatch, and it's the reason why I constantly switch to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> when I work out.</p><p>The Pixel Watch does a great job tracking my workouts, especially my runs (when I actually do them), but it's not so great at keeping track when I lift weights. In fact, it's pretty rudimentary when compared to some other smartwatches, and frankly, I'm surprised that Google hasn't improved on this front with its flagship smartwatch. Heart rate, active calories, and cardio load are all there, but the one thing I <em>really </em>need is automatic rep counting.</p><p>This is something Garmin does very well; even Samsung manages this to some extent. With the focus on more running features in recent years, I would love to see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> add rep counting to its repertoire.</p><h2 id="how-garmin-counts-reps-and-sets-2">How Garmin counts reps and sets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3603px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-workout-screen" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HrvdUFo4cbXfa8iHLEJEjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3603" height="2027" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I really like that Garmin can automatically count reps and start or stop sets. This means I don't have to manually do it every time; the watch does it for me. When I'm at the gym, I'm often lost in my music. While I'm not as serious as some of the other guys who jot down their every set in notebooks, I still like to stay on track with my workouts. That said, I often forget what rep or set I'm on, so it's nice to glance at my Garmin watch to check.</p><p>I don't know the ins and outs of how this works, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=xEPSpxE3j27gpEsiq8K9o8">Garmin states</a> that it can track "weight training exercises that consist of distinct and consistent motions, such as bench press," as well as "exercises designed to target single muscle groups/body parts." After performing the same movement a few times, it'll register that I am performing a set and will start counting my reps, retroactively adding my first reps to my current ones.</p><p>Once I stop performing those movements, the watch will automatically log that set and enter a resting period, complete with its own timer, so that I'm not over- or under-resting between sets. That rest period will stop once it notices that I've started performing repetitive movements again.

However, it can automatically detect certain activities, such as running and walking. I feel that Fitbit could utilize the same movement data for weightlifting reps, as Garmin does. Even if it isn't perfect, I think something would be better than nothing.</p><p>I'm not the only one who feels that Google could and should do better. Android Central senior editor Nicholas Sutrich also points out that his Amazfit watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions" target="_blank">makes his Pixel Watch feel like a toy</a>, with a major feature highlight being the ability to log and analyze reps as you work out. And like Garmin, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">Amazfit</a> uses this data in a pretty useful way that Google could learn from.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-perfect-but-it-s-better-than-nothing-2">It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3597px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP" name="Garmin-Forerunner-570-edit-workout" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 570 edit workout set screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UD4XTfrMNyGTnbhmbxi4kP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3597" height="2023" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the method isn't 100% accurate, Garmin watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> do a great job at it, and are either spot on with the counts or off by just one or (at most) two reps. However, if you do notice that something's off, Garmin lets you quickly edit the reps and even input the weight while it counts down to begin the rest period.</p><p>You can also edit the last set if you forget to, or go into the Garmin app to make any changes later.</p><p>It's also important to note that this feature typically only works on workouts where the watch can accurately track your movements. Garmin actually has a list of workouts that are more difficult to track with its watches, so it's important to keep this in mind if you plan to rely on this feature:</p><ul><li>Stationary wrist exercises: dips, pullups, pushups, planks</li><li>Leg isolated exercises: extensions, seated presses, calf raises, hamstring curls</li><li>Complex/hybrid motions: box jumps, “CrossFit” type exercises, burpees</li><li>Short-range exercises: shoulder shrugs</li><li>Battle ropes and jump rope</li></ul><p>In these cases, the watch often won't register that you're even doing anything and will continue to show you in a rest period. As a result, leg day is probably the only time when this feature is not reliable, aside from squats. However, they're generally reliable for weightlifting and can serve as a good alternative to pen and paper.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-counting-reps-it-s-so-much-more-2">It's not just counting reps. It's so much more</h2><p>While counting reps, Gamin actually takes this data even further. It uses that movement data to determine what exercises I'm doing. Then, after my workout, it shows me a diagram of the muscle groups that I worked out based on my movements.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6" name="Garmin-targeted-muscles" alt="A visual of the targeted muscle groups in a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QiytkJVy2AQXx3yYApXy6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1224" height="816" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A visual of the targeted muscle groups during a workout session with primarily chest and tricep exercises. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Again, it's not 100% accurate, but it's pretty spot on most of the time, and it's a handy way to visualize my workouts and see which muscles got more focused than others, as well as what I may need to work on the next day or the following week.</p><p>Right now, I enjoy using Fitbit on the Pixel Watch, particularly for the AI-powered running coach, but the post-workout data is often pretty barebones. Adding more metrics like movement data and targeted muscle graphs would go a long way towards enhancing Fitbit for more people who could benefit from that data.</p><h2 id="learn-from-garmin-compete-with-samsung-2">Learn from Garmin, compete with Samsung</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo" name="Smartwatches-smart-ring-and-smart-glasses" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, Garmin Fenix 8, Galaxy Watch Ultra, Ultrahuman Ring Air, and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yHerFynjGJ6kDrNcvmE6Yo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Google announced the Pixel Watch 3, it was clear that there is more focus on running features and anything else, as if Google is trying to compete with Garmin to try and steal customers away from its popular Forerunner or Venu series. That may or may not be true, but I think Google should expand the scope of the Pixel Watch beyond just running.</p><p>I'm not saying Google shouldn't add more running features. By all means, I'm sure my colleague Michael Hicks would love to see more Garmin-like features on the Pixel Watch that cater to runners. That said, the Pixel Watch still can't compete with Garmin in terms of battery life or the sheer number of activity/sports modes.</p><p>However, Samsung is a good place to look, and I think Google should shift its focus to competing with the Galaxy Watch wherever it can.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-5-Google-Pixel-Watch-glass.jpg" alt="Comparing the curved glass on a Google Pixel Watch with the flat glass on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JnqQqwf2BFr5tZiteyF5tY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When I first bought my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-vs-5">Galaxy Watch 5</a> a few years ago, I was very surprised to see that it automatically counted my reps. This was before I had ever used a Garmin watch, so I was quite impressed to see this feature on a Wear OS watch. That said, it still left a lot to be desired.</p><p>At the gym, it would often count almost <em>any </em>movement as a rep, overestimating the count by quite a bit. It also wouldn't automatically start and stop sets, so I would have to do it manually; otherwise, every movement would count as a rep in a single set. Still, I appreciated that it at least <em>tried </em>to count my reps for me, even if the results were pretty inaccurate.</p><p>The feature was also limited to certain workouts, forcing you to change to specific exercises, whereas Garmin will log whatever you do based solely on your movements. There's no need to specify beforehand what workout you're about to do.</p><p>I haven't had the opportunity to test any newer Galaxy smartwatches, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, but this is at least an area where Google can try to one-up Samsung's fitness efforts by learning from Garmin.</p><h2 id="improved-strength-training-in-the-works-2">Improved strength training in the works?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-01" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4WQK9PfiUyFYyQ45s8mKLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch may not have the battery life to compete with Garmin, but Google has access to a wealth of data and numerous ways to utilize it in ways that will benefit its consumers. I have complete faith that Google could bring features like automatic rep counting to the Pixel Watch, especially if it means giving users a more comprehensive look at their workouts.</p><p>And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Pixel Watch 4</a> right around the corner, I really hope Google throws us a bone and adds more features geared toward weightlifters and bodybuilders. Because, as it stands, I'm either going to continue to rely on Garmin for the gym, or I'll update my aging Galaxy Watch 5 to the Galaxy Watch 8 and make that my go-to smartwatch for everything.</p><p>Fortunately, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-watch-4-strength-training">a recent leak</a> suggests that Google may be looking to improve the strength training experience on the Pixel Watch 4. This may include features like a Workout Builder where users can curate their workouts, warm-ups, and cool-downs. It may also include real-time guidance, form insights, and advanced insights, which sounds a lot like what Garmin provides post-workout.</p><p>Whether or not automatic rep counting is included remains to be seen, but this sounds incredibly positive if it does launch with the Pixel Watch 4.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Basically, Google is stepping in to handle part of the heavy lifting under the hood.</p><p>The AI giant has long leaned solely on Microsoft Azure to keep its services running. But with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">demand climbing</a>, it’s shifting gears and looking to expand its backend setup and avoid putting all its eggs in Microsoft’s basket.</p><p>This marks the first big move in that shift. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/16/openai-googles-cloud-chatgpt.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, OpenAI is about to start running parts of ChatGPT on Google's cloud.

With the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google</a> event set for August 20 and Galaxy Unpacked behind us, our attention now turns to see what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> will offer.</p><p>Of course, this won't be the only device announced at the event, as Google's entire flagship phone lineup is likely to see a refresh. And perhaps we'll even see a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch</a> along with some new smart home hardware. Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has arrived, it begs the question of whether you should wait for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold or not.</p><h2 id="what-changes-do-we-expect-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-2">What changes do we expect for the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold?</h2><p>Before we can make a suggestion, one way or another, we need to put the cards out on the table. Thankfully, leaks and rumors have given us a pretty good indication of what to expect, provided that they ring true. With that, here's a quick rundown of what the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to bring:</p><ul><li>Slightly larger and brighter cover display (6.3-inch/2,700 nits vs. 6.4-inch/3,000 nits).</li><li>The inner screen remains the same, with a potential bump in peak brightness.</li><li>Google Tensor G5 replaces the Tensor G4, potentially with 16GB of RAM.</li><li>Battery size rumored to increase to ~5,000mAh, and leaks suggest Qi2 compatibility with faster 15W wireless charging.</li><li>It could be the first foldable with an IP68 rating.</li><li>Minimal, if any, camera hardware changes are rumored.</li></ul><p>If the rumors prove true, we're in store for three major upgrades with the Pixel 10 Fold. And at least one of them comes as a huge surprise, especially given the recent slew of new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> that have been released from Samsung, Honor, and Vivo.</p><h2 id="3-reasons-to-wait-2">3 reasons to wait</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first of which is the most obvious, with Google expected to introduce its Tensor G5. This will be the first Tensor chip to come from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">TSMC factory</a>, as opposed to previous generations that Samsung built.</p><p>The G5 is also likely to be built on the 3nm process, introducing a wave of performance, efficiency, and AI improvements over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">leaked Geekbench results</a>, we're likely looking at performance in line with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And while that might sound disappointing, it's a massive step up from the Tensor G4, which even fell short of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from 2023.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:83.92%;"><img id="ASme8cfUTeeaJYSVu2gF8n" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-pixel-10-pro-fold-geekbench-comp" alt="Geekbench 6 results between the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and leaked Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ASme8cfUTeeaJYSVu2gF8n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1692" height="1420" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Geekbench)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1416px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="Dj9LKfvAkr5QoHnErSJDLK" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-vs-pixel-10-pro-fold-geekbench-comp" alt="Geekbench results comparing Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dj9LKfvAkr5QoHnErSJDLK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1416" height="944" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Geekbench)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1430px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.67%;"><img id="jEYebdeh8TrvfdZCXN66LK" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-vs-pixel-10-pro-fold-geekbench-comp" alt="Geekbench results comparing Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jEYebdeh8TrvfdZCXN66LK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1430" height="982" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Geekbench)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>So, while it might seem disappointing that the Tensor G5 won't be able to match up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, this is still an incredible upgrade over the previous iteration.

Recent rumors claim that Google's next foldable will be the first foldable phone to feature an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-folds-durability-rating-might-give-you-more-peace-of-mind">IP68 water and dust resistance rating</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QB4P9UVRZzXAGGchRiabvP" name="galaxy-z-fold-6-raindrops.jpg" alt="Raindrops on the Galaxy Z Fold 6s inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QB4P9UVRZzXAGGchRiabvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Up to this point, the best we've seen is an IP48 rating for the Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. Before that, the "standard" for foldable phones was an IPX8 rating, meaning that there was no dust protection. However, if Google can pull this off, we'd finally have a foldable phone that is fully protected against dust, managing to get in and wreak havoc.</p><p>And as a result, it might pave the way for more people to consider foldable phones in the future. One of the primary concerns with these devices is durability, and an IP68 rating would definitely help in a big way to ease those concerns.</p><h2 id="one-reason-why-you-might-want-to-stand-pat-2">One reason why you might want to stand pat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google set a massive bar with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, not only for itself but also for the competition, as it was drastically different from the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>. However, those hoping for a similar shift with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be disappointed as indications are that the 9 Pro Fold and 10 Pro Fold look almost identical.</p><p>That extends to the camera hardware, as it appears there may not be many meaningful changes on this front. For anyone looking for major camera upgrades, you might be disappointed.</p><p>This is the same complaint that I had with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which didn't share the same sensors as the 9 Pro XL. At the time, Google said this was due to trying to keep the Fold as thin as possible. While rumors suggest the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro series</a> won't be seeing any upgrades either, I would've expected at least one of the cameras to be upgraded on the Fold.</p><h2 id="one-more-thing-2">One more thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hS82GFCEDf3TFs9bT7rphR" name="Google-Store-Brooklyn.jpg" alt="The Google Store in Brooklyn, NY" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hS82GFCEDf3TFs9bT7rphR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one more important factor to consider if you're trying to decide if you should wait for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold: price. The newly-launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">Galaxy Z Fold 7 is $2,000</a>, and rumors suggest price increases are coming to much of the Pixel 10 lineup.</p><p>However, those same rumors also claim that Google is considering dropping the price for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The current iteration retails for $1,799, but is often on sale for much less. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could come in at $1,599, matching that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.giztop.com/honor-magic-v5.html">Honor Magic V5's price</a> if you were to import one.</p><p>Provided that the price reduction comes to fruition, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is going to be even more enticing than before. Better performance, bigger battery, lower price, AND an IP68 rating? Yeah, I would definitely wait just a little bit longer for Google's official unveiling of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://samsungmobilepress.com/feature-stories/the-breakthroughs-powering-samsungs-thinnest-most-refined-foldables/">a press release</a>, the company detailed the catalysts behind those refinements. The hinge is where Samsung states it started when it came to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-upgrade-to-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. This third-generation Armor FlexHinge cut down the device's profile by roughly 27%, which also made it 43% lighter.</p><p>This new hinge is smaller; however, the post states it keeps the same strength as the bulkier hinge from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">the Fold 6</a>. Another key upgrade is the hinge's wingplate, which Samsung says lets the display lie flatter when fully opened.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Lock Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A2nJeXvDmfeKkKp5Rnb3r3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The display itself boosts Samsung's "flagship quality" even higher by reducing its thickness by 39%. However, the UTG, or ultra-thin glass, materials are 50% thicker. While these two statements might seem to contradict each other, the UTG upgrade helps to reduce the visibility of the phone's crease.</p><p>Hardware-wise, the Fold 7 drops its thickness by half over the series' first-ever launch, measuring 8.9mm when folded. Joining this is an even brighter display at a new 21:9 aspect ratio, which makes its experience much wider, too.</p><p>The Fold 7's camera array features a 200MP lens for the first time. Samsung said it worked to implement a new "thin actuator" and completely redesigned the camera's structure to fit the lens in without compromise.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-s-unsung-heroics-2">The Flip 7's Unsung Heroics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-12" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Giex8BdsLmvHvkMXqsBjA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 might feel like an unspoken hero this year, but Samsung says it's reduced its profile to just 13.7mm when folded. That measurement drops even more to 6.5mm when the clamshell is opened. Arguably, the most talked-about aspect of the Flip 7 is its larger, immersive cover display.</p><p>The Flip 7 introduced an edge-to-edge display that wraps around its dual camera lenses. This results in a 4-inch cover screen, fully capable of letting users access AI features, check emails, watch videos, and more.</p><p>Another hidden gem is the device's bezels—they've gotten slimmer, too. Samsung claims the Flip 7 features "the world’s thinnest display bezel" on a foldable. Technically speaking, the phone saw a 68% reduction its its screen bezels, breathing life into its display experience.</p><p>Back when the foldables launched on July 9, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">did so without a notable aspect</a>: the S Pen. Samsung shed the S Pen (and its digitizer) on the device to help thin the phone even more. This is a feature that, while useful, not <em>many </em>people use. The S Pen was useful in various cases for those who loved it, and it'll likely be missed this year. However, there's a chance the S Pen could make a return on a future Z Fold series model.</p><p>Earlier this week, Samsung's executive director of the MX business division, Kang Min-seok, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">said the company may "reconsider"</a> bringing the S Pen back. This isn't an easy thing to do, according to Kang, as Samsung is thinking about investing R&D resources into "innovative tech" for a thinner S Pen. More importantly, Samsung says consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ea8d5033-0a00-4b56-b599-ddb4fbbea3a4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable. The device sports a folded measurement of 8.9mm, severely cutting out the bulk and heft of its previous models. Additionally, consumers will find a stronger 200MP camera, like you would on the Galaxy S25 Ultra. The Fold 7 not only elevates its scrolling and gaming experiences, but also its ability to capture your memories.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

After all, we&apos;re technically talking about four phones here — the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Will these devices get cheaper now that they&apos;re being supplanted by newer models, or will they simply be forgotten amidst all of the new-phone hubbub? Let&apos;s discuss. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Earlier this week, Google confirmed that its next Made by Google event would be held on Wednesday, August 20th in New York City, with some sources suggesting that the keynote speech would start at 10am PT. </p><p>An official invite sent to some media outlets supposedly claimed that Google would be using the event to reveal new “Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more.” This suggests that, in addition to the Pixel 10 series, we can expect to get a first look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>, the Pixel Buds 2a, and possibly even Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">long-teased AR smart glasses</a>. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold review -" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLQafRTYoDpJydKNjLLvsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to some recent leaks and rumors, Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5 chipset</a> and boast some upgraded camera tech, new displays, and the largest battery of any Pixel phone to date. The Pixel 10 Pro (and Pro XL) are also expected to receive a price increase of at least $100. As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, rumors have suggested that Google is working on a new hinge for its premium foldable, plus some upgraded camera tech and a boost in battery size. The Fold is also allegedly going to receive a $200 price increase, putting it at a steep $1,999.99, right next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> (don&apos;t get me started).</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-9-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel 9 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-in-hand-rear.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro XL in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A5JUsMmXbpHi5T5WexKYy9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million-dollar question: will the Google Pixel 9 series get cheaper once the Pixel 10 is out? Well, I have some good news and (potentially) bad news. </p><p>The bad news is that the Google Pixel 9 (and 9 Pro, et al.) probably won&apos;t get an official price decrease once the new models are out, and it&apos;s just as likely that the 2024 flagships will actually become harder to find as the year progresses. After all, when was the last time you saw a Google Pixel 8 that wasn&apos;t refurbished? </p><p>The <em>good </em>news is that Google Pixel 9 deals are pretty easy to find right now. Just last week during Prime Day, we saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/amazon-prime-day-google-pixel-deals-2025">Pixel deals</a> that dropped the base model Pixel 9 to as low as $549, while carriers like Mint Mobile are currently slashing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>over 50% off the phone</strong></a> when you bundle with a wireless plan. </p><p>In other words, no, I don&apos;t expect the Pixel 9 to get a permanent price decrease when the Pixel 10 is revealed. But given the frequency of discounts on the Google Pixel 9 lineup, you don&apos;t necessarily need one. And don&apos;t forget: we&apos;ll also be seeing a lot of great Google Pixel 10 preorder deals once the flagship lineup is announced on August 20th, so you may be able to skip the last generation altogether. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="35af0509-f87b-4ab6-bf8f-35bd0b6556cc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small but mighty</strong></em></p><p>Although its soon to be replaced by the Pixel 10, the base model <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> continues to be one of Google's greatest creations, balancing a sleek, compact frame with powerful hardware and loads of AI-boosted smarts.

The Galaxy Watch 8 comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm. The 40mm variant has a 1.34-inch AMOLED screen, whereas the 44mm version has a 1.47-inch AMOLED panel. This means you can't use screen protectors designed for either model on the other.</p><p>With that in mind, the next thing to sort out is whether you want to use a case with your Watch 8 or not. Both sizes have decent case options that come with screen protectors bundled together, adding value. The Tensea 5+5Pack for Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Screen Protector Case 44mm, in particular, offers an insanely good bargain, giving you five robust 9H tempered glass protectors and five hard bumper cases together for just $10.</p><p>If you want to keep things simple, the SPGUARD 4 Pack is perfect for any user. Available in both 40mm and 44mm sizes, this four-pack gives you a cleaning kit as well as four robust pieces of tempered glass for about $8. It's the ideal kit, leaving you plenty of spares after the initial installation.</p><p>Check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">best Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 bands</a> while you're shopping for your new Watch 8.

In their statement, the company said its PWM rate has dipped from 2,160Hz to 960Hz; however, this only goes into effect at low brightness. Nothing adds that while the display is still capable of the original rate (2,160Hz), this change should benefit the display's performance at lower brightness levels.</p><p>The spokesperson states, "...we found display performance at low brightness produces the best quality picture with this updated rate, so we have prioritised picture quality for the final retail software."</p><p>The reasoning for this, on a technical level, wasn't expressed by the Nothing spokesperson at this time. Sutrich states he is looking into it, but there wasn't anything concrete in time for publication. Curiously, this isn't the first time a company has decided to drop its PWM rate on a device for its final retail software. Google did this before, too, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">the Pixel 8 Pro</a>.</p><p>Sutrich states that during the timeline around launch, the review unit he received used 480Hz PWM. Once the final rate software was released, things dipped to 240Hz.</p><h2 id="in-the-interest-of-your-eyes-2">In the interest of your eyes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4" name="pwm-hero-01" alt="Comparing the dimming technologies between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, iPhone 14 Pro Max, OnePlus 13, and Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>PWM, otherwise known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">pulse width modulation</a>," is a technology used by brands to rapidly turn the display on and off to trick your eyes into thinking the screen's brighter or dimmer. It's this flickering that can cause grueling problems for people who are PWM sensitive. Some people can suffer from eye straight, headaches, dizziness, a sense of vertigo, nausea, and a whole host of other uncomfortable feelings.</p><p>There are some solutions if you've felt anything like this after using your phone for a while.

The stress on my heart culminated in a heart attack five years ago, and recovery involved careful monitoring - in the hospital and at home - of my Vascular system, as a 95% blockage was the root cause.</p><p>The new vascular load feature is designed to measure and monitor whether your heart is pumping blood through your arteries efficiently. It measures the resistance to blood flow (resistive load) and the stiffness of the arteries (pulsatile load) to determine whether your heart is working properly. Too much pressure or too stiff arteries can lead to more serious conditions, including heart failure like mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA" name="Samsung-Mobile-Galaxy-Unpacked-July-2025-Galaxy-Watch8-Series-Classic-Ultra-Comfort-PR_main3-F" alt="Vascular Load on the Galaxy Watch 8" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoqpLPTXsG4GgSywZYXCYA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the type of feature that many people won't need, but for those who do, it could prove to be lifesaving.

The Galaxy Watch 7 and all the smartwatches that came before it supported quick-release bands, so you had as many options as there are drops of water in the ocean. With the change to Dynamic Lug connectors, the new Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic have a far narrower selection of bands. Nonetheless, what's available right now isn't bad.</p><p>Samsung's Watch 8 Classic Sport Band is an ideal partner for the smartwatch. It's easily adjustable, fairly durable, and made of pretty soft rubber that also happens to be waterproof. Plus, there are five different colors to choose from. It's always nice to have a spare rubber or silicone band to match your casual outfit of the day.</p><p>For dressier occasions, consider a leather wristband or a classy metal band. Whether you're a leather person or a steel person, there are great options for both types. For instance, the SPGUARD Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic Stainless Steel Strap is adjustable, comes in two colors, and it's really durable. The links are removable, and the stainless steel clasp offers a snug, secure fit. Since it's made of stainless steel, exposure to water is no issue at all. This isn't the case with leather options, as water destroys leather goods. Sankel's Watch 8 Classic Genuine Leather Band weathers with age, giving it that dashing texture only real leather can deliver.</p><p>And if you can't choose between the two, why not get both? The YEEJOK Metal+Leather Watch Straps two-pack gives you both, though the leather is most likely not genuine. Regardless, it's a fantastic deal for the price of a single watch band, and you get two different styles!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that Samsung officially registered a new device under the name "Galaxy Z Trifold" earlier this week in South Korea.</p><p>Earlier leaks have suggested that this device could be called the G Fold, based on the way the hinges would work, allowing the device to close inward. However, it might not be the case.</p><p>It seems like the company has applied for a trademark certification on the name, which could mean that the company might stick to the same name at least in its domestic market. "After all, the first version will only be released in South Korea, and perhaps China – but not in Europe or the US," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-trifold/">Galaxy Club added.</a></p><p>Whether or not Samsung keeps the name, this trademark registration reveals that the device might show up in the Galaxy Z lineup, and the word "trifold" indicates the presence of two hinges, as seen in previous rumors about the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website also adds that the trifold has been given a model number SM-F968N and the internal codename Q7M. And the phone is steadily moving towards a year-end launch. This was backed by another recent mention of the trifold, right from the source itself.</p><p>Samsung's acting head of the device experience division, TM Roh, said during a press interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says" target="_blank">The Korea Times</a> that the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year." Roh spoke about those Galaxy trifold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet. Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't give us any other specifications or features about the tri-fold.</p><p>So far, rumors have indicated that this phone will allegedly fold inward, feature a massive 10-inch display when unfolded, and a slightly thicker build when compared to Huawei's tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>. The external display could measure about 6.49 inches, but might not support the S-Pen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">just like the latest Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Apart from those hardware aspects, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak" target="_blank">recent leak</a> showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 </a>animations on the alleged trifold device, including its functions. One animation demonstrates the trifold's folding process, where the left-most portion opens, revealing its full display.</p><p>The animation shows that two hinges fold inward, but the left and right panels are of different sizes. The former is much smaller, meaning that it needs to be folded first. This is backed up by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><p>That said, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-concept-fully-revealed-showcase">may have beaten Samsung to the punch</a> and unveiled its Phantom Ultimate G Fold concept today (July 17). The phone sports a "G-style" inward folding design with two hinges, with a thickness that is "comparable" to a regular book-style phone (think Z Fold 7), but its open state measures 3.49mm thin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you&apos;re not totally sold on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet, you can also test drive the service for 15 days and get all of your money back if you&apos;re not feeling it. T-Mo will even pay for the shipping. Needless to say, there are plenty of good reasons to consider T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet if it&apos;s available in your area.

We're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">expecting a handful of announcements</a>, including the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 XL, and Pixel 10 Fold. Phew.</p><p>However, while new hardware is always exciting to see unveiled, is it actually worth waiting for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10</a>, or should you opt for a discounted Pixel 9 instead? The answer to this question varies greatly depending on which model you're looking to pick up, so let's take a look at what we're expecting Google to unveil and how it compares to the Pixel 9 family.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf" name="Made-by-google-2024-poster" alt="Google 2024 poster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're excited about Google's smallest, most affordable phone in the Pixel 10 lineup, I recommend waiting for the Pixel 10. Of all the models, the base Pixel 10 looks to be getting the most changes compared to the currently available Pixel 9. Here's a quick breakdown based on rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>A telephoto camera (5x optical zoom <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-alleged-prototype-surfaces-chinese-auction-site-spotted">according to leaks</a>)</li><li>New sensors for the main and ultrawide cameras</li><li>Larger batteries</li></ul><p>We don't expect any physical design changes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9 to the Pixel 10</a> other than the addition of that third camera on the back. This new camera would mark the first time Google has put a telephoto camera on a base Pixel model. One of the biggest reasons to choose the Pro model in the past was for the telephoto camera, so this makes the decision to get the base Pixel 10 much easier than in the past.</p><p>It's rumored that Google will be using smaller main and ultrawide camera sensors to fit this new telephoto camera in. While that sounds like a downgrade at first, we had this same concern with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> — which featured smaller sensors than the Pixel 8a — but it turned out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">that the camera was just fine</a>. In other words, the Pixel 10 should be a camera upgrade on all counts.</p><p>Additionally, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal" target="_blank">Tensor G5 processor</a>, which is expected to debut in the Pixel 10, is reportedly around 25% faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9. That's a big deal because Tensor speeds have been generally stagnant for years, and the latest leaked benchmarks are showing that the G5 is comparable to last year's best Snapdragon processor — a huge improvement over the Pixel 9.</p><p>Lastly, Google is reportedly increasing the battery capacity by a small amount. The Pixel 10 is rumored to ship with a 4,970mAh battery, while the Pixel 9 had a 4,700mAh battery. That might not make a huge difference in daily usage, but it could help get you through the end of the day without having to top up.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-or-xl-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10 Pro or XL?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Fold leaks have shown some interesting changes, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">look less exciting</a>.

Here's what we expect to see when Google announces these phones in mid-August, per rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>Larger batteries</li><li>Faster PWM rate</li></ul><p>That's not a lot of changes year-over-year, and it makes for a less exciting August for Pro model fans. But that doesn't mean there won't be <em>any</em> upgrades, as the Tensor G5 upgrade could be worth it alone if you're into mobile gaming. A slight increase in battery sizes of about 150mAh for each model also means just a tad more juice to get through your day. Charging speeds are likely the same between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">Geekbench leak</a> for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveals that the Tensor G5 is performing at speeds comparable to those of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, marking a significant improvement. Comparatively, the Tensor G4 performed roughly equivalent to a Galaxy S22 Ultra on a good day. That still means that Tensor doesn't match phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in terms of speed, but it might be enough to make up the difference for mobile gamers.</p><p>Folks who are sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> have been unable to use Pixel phones for a long time, but the Pixel 10 Pro line could change that with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-display-leak-pwm-dimming-rate" target="_blank">improved PWM rate</a> and a rumored accessibility feature for those with extra sensitivity. As someone who is PWM sensitive, this is music to my ears, meaning I could enjoy using a Pixel full-time again without getting a headache.</p><h2 id="how-about-the-cost-2">How about the cost?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-with-box-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen rumors that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro will retain the same MSRP as the equivalent Pixel 9 models, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is apparently getting a $100 price increase. During Prime Day, we saw the Pixel 9 Pro go for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-prime-day-deal-2025">as low as $734</a>, and it's clear that stores like Amazon and Best Buy are looking to get rid of their stock before the Pixel 10 needs to be on shelves.</p><p>If you're in the market for a base Pixel 10, I say wait. The changes look to be big enough to justify your patience, even if you'll end up spending more than if you picked up a discounted Pixel 9 right now. Folks interested in a Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL are safe to grab a cheap Pixel 9 Pro/XL right now unless they fall into either of these two categories: gamers, and PWM sensitive people.</p><p>Gamers should wait for the Pixel 10 as the extra performance from Tensor G5 will likely make mobile games on a Pixel worth playing. PWM-sensitive people should wait to see what Google has in store for the Pixel 10 Pro series, as we've been told Google is working on something specifically for this subset of users.</p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro XL ends up receiving the rumored $100 price bump, there's almost no reason to recommend buying that model over a discounted Pixel 9 Pro XL. Based on current trends, that means the Pixel 10 Pro XL would end up being roughly $400 more than the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it's on sale, and no upgrade is worth that kind of cost.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster boldly states Samsung's recent Fold 7 "is the thinnest folding mobile phone in the world." According to their test, which showcased both foldables side by side on a table, the Fold 7 appeared ever-so-slightly thinner than the Magic V5.</p><p>To illustrate this, Ice Universe placed objects (cards) across the tops of both devices. When set down, the card just barely teetered downward toward the Fold 7. Subtle tests with items showed that the Fold 7 appears to have a minuscule edge over the Magic V5 in thinness.</p><p>Ice Universe ran the devices through a quick caliper test, which shed more light. In their test, the Magic V5 resulted in an 8.95mm measurement, while the Fold 7 saw 8.79mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.93%;"><img id="d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-caliper-thin-measurement" alt="Honor's image of a caliper's 8.8mm measurement for the Magic V5 foldable, delivered to a publication after reports claim it is not the thinnest." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="448" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the tipster's "rigorous" testing, the publication received a statement from Honor about the matter.

Since style is subjective, I'll focus on the more quantifiable second perk: Is the rotating bezel worth it, and will you like how Samsung changed it?</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a> had rotating bezels around their displays, hearkening back to the original Tizen OS Galaxy Watch design. Physical controls define the "Classic" experience as much as the retro chic; it's why so many Samsung watch fans skip alternating years to avoid the mainline models' digital bezel.</p><p>I'm thrilled to have swapped back to a Classic design after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for a year, even if it meant losing battery life for exact controls. But there's one change to the bezel that's more about looks than utility, to which Classic veterans will have to adjust.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-bezel-is-different-from-its-predecessors-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 bezel is different from its predecessors</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-original" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy Watch (2018) held in someone's hand, showing a Classic-style bezel and watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="772" height="434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The original Samsung Galaxy Watch design </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT" name="best-samsung-watch-bands-hero.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 worn on someone's left wrist, showing an analogue watch face and steel rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT.jpeg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, still running Tizen OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-4-Classic-fitness-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic fitness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-workouts.jpg" alt="Selecting a workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Look at the Galaxy Watch, Watch 3, Watch 4 Classic, and Watch 6 Classic in the slideshow above. Samsung gave each rotating bezel tiny ridges that add grip but don't feel too rough against your fingertips. On my Watch 6 Classic, I appreciated how only the bottom half of the bezel is ridged, so it feels completely smooth to turn when I grip from the top.</p><p>Designed with function in mind, these bezels are subtle compared to luxury watches' rotating bezels; those are designed for diving, with thick, striking ridges that aren't as comfortable to turn but make a statement.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic lacks the 60-second markings along the border that were present on the Watch 1, 3, and 4 Classic. Samsung attempted to emulate this look with "classic" watch faces, but from the wearer's perspective with the display dimmed, the last Classic appeared somewhat bare-bones, similar to other smartwatches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now look at the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel. Its ridges are deeper and extend to the top, so you get plenty of texture against your fingers every time you turn it. And Samsung brought back the 60-second scale around the display, which gives the Classic a bit of <em>class</em>.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that Samsung sacrificed comfort for style. I wouldn't necessarily call the Watch 8 Classic bezel <em>un</em>comfortable, but it does press into your fingers as you grip it. I turn it more deliberately than my Watch 6 Classic bezel.</p><p>But since people are paying for a distinct look as much as improved controls — and since the bezel balances out the thick, Ultra-esque look of the Watch 8 series — I think the new bezel was the right choice. And since Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">improved the Watch 8 Tiles</a> to fit more information per Tile, I don't usually need to turn the bezel that much to find what I need.</p><h2 id="why-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-bezel-is-or-isn-t-worth-it-2">Why the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel is (or isn't) worth it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The old Classics cost $100 more than the base models, offering more flair but no new features. Samsung made the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic $150 more, whether because of tariffs or inflation. You get double the storage and the third Quick Button in exchange, but these alone aren't worth the upgrade if you don't like the Classic's whole raison d'être.</p><p>Is the physical bezel worth paying extra for? It lets you turn to the exact Tile, notification, or menu you want, with <em>clicks</em> marking each turn that I find satisfying, but others might find annoying.</p><p>Galaxy Watches' default digital bezel makes it way too easy to scroll past things, but it's also faster once you master it, and you may prefer a quick single-finger scroll to the two-finger grip the Classic demands. I don't, but you might!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I appreciate how I can check notifications or Tiles with a single scroll, my wrist still sitting on my desk as I type. This might sound small, but not having to tap the display or lift it to my eyes to check something is highly convenient.</p><p>If you regularly work out, you'll appreciate the option to scroll through data fields via bezel instead of relying on sweaty finger swipes. But some will accept less exact controls for a lighter Watch 8 fit.</p><p>Overall, I much prefer using the Watch 8 Classic to its standard and Ultra siblings for everyday use, and I also think the bezel adds a distinctive look that the other two lack. But this new design only fits a 1.34-inch display, so if you're accustomed to a 1.5-inch display, you'll have to skip the bezel.</p><p>If I were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/should-you-upgrade-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-watch-8-classic">upgrading to the Watch 8 series</a>, the Classic would be my first choice, especially with a Watch 6 Classic trade-in.

It seems Honor is investing resources into its mid-range and flagship phone lines. DCS states the company is looking to boost its more affordable devices to a range of 8,200mAh-8,400mAh.</p><p>Similarly, the Chinese OEM's flagship phones could see batteries between the range of 7,020mAh and 7,200mAh.</p><p>The tipster didn't state (or allege, rather) when consumers could see these mid-range and flagship Honor phones with this battery increase. Maybe we should look at 2026 for this supposed battery capacity boost. The publication speculates we could see this rumored power boost sometime this year, so we'll have to see what happens.</p><h2 id="staying-off-the-charger-for-longer-2">Staying off the charger for longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero" alt="The Honor Magic V5 in Dawn Gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor consumers would likely enjoy these rumored battery increases, especially when you look back at the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">previous Pro flagship phones</a>. The Honor Magic 7 Pro, which saw a global debut earlier this year in January, debuted with a 5,270mAh battery. While this is smaller than the Chinese variant (5,850mAh), the Magic 7 Pro still rocks the brand's third-gen silicon tech. The phone can last an entire day, even through some heavy use, so it wasn't too bad of a compromise.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro's silicon battery tech from Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">already made the phone stand out</a> around the time of its launch. According to our very own Harish Jonnalagadda, this technology means Honor's batteries will have "higher density." In short, "brands can leverage this tech to add bigger batteries without increasing the size or weight of their phones, and that's always a good thing."</p><p>On the other hand, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review#section-honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">the Magic 6 Pro</a> and its 5,600mAh battery. Heavy to medium use saw similar durations with the 7 Pro. If the tipster is believed, bumping future flagships to 7,000mAh or higher would do wonders for the devices, as users can likely go even further on a single full charge.</p><p>One outlier <em>might </em>be its foldable, specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">the Magic V5</a> and future iterations of it. Honor really honed in on shaving it down to make it thinner. Considering Honor's battery tech use, perhaps it can implement larger batteries while keeping its future Magic V foldables incredibly thin.</p><p>The Magic V5 sports a 6,100mAh battery based on Honor's "razor-thin" silicon-carbon battery technology.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After many teasers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">and prototypes</a>, TECNO states its G Fold concept achieves a thickness of 11.49mm. A size that's "comparable" to many dual-folding (book-style) foldables on the market. However, when fully opened, TECNO states its G Fold's "ultra-slim" profile measures out to 3.49mm.</p><p>TECNO credits its development process for fine-tuning the phone's display, materials, and hinges to achieve such a thin measurement, despite its form factor.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-snake-g-fold" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept features an inward folding "G" mechanic, that looks like a snake." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-open-thin" alt="The TECNO Phantom Ultimate G Fold fully open, showing off its incredibly thin profile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-cover-display" alt="TECNO's G Fold concept fully closed, showing off its cover display that feels close to a regular smartphone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold's hinge is a shining highlight for TECNO. The post states the device's concept receives an "innovative G-style design" for its hinges. The G Fold offers two hinges, one for each inward folding display. These hinges aren't created equally, as TECNO states the right side boasts a smaller waterdrop hinge, while the left side is a "larger primary" hinge.</p><p>The right side folds in first and then the left. TECNO states both inward folding displays offer a "gapless and secure" experience, to ensure the screens—especially the center—remain safe.</p><p>When fully unfolded, TECNO says the G Fold delivers a 9.94-inch display "with minimal creasing." Additionally, the company highlights the G Fold's multi-angle hovering, thanks to its "dual-cam" design. The post teases that the concept allows for users to utilize the phone in a partially folded state to get quick bouts of work done before moving on.</p><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold is still a concept, but TECNO teases its specifications, which claim to not compromise on the flagship experience. The G Fold is expected to be powered by a high-performance chip with a triple camera array and a battery that's over 5,000mAh.</p><p>TECNO is expected to fully showcase the Phantom Ultimate G Fold during MWC 2026.</p><h2 id="concept-revealed-2">Concept Revealed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-rear-panels" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept from behind, showing off its three panels and triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TECNO has been gearing up for a complete reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-new-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-tri-fold-concept-tease">of its G Fold concept</a> for a while now. Earlier this month saw the company tease the device right before Samsung's Unpacked event for its foldables. Samsung is also reportedly developing its own tri-fold, and it seems TECNO is already seeking competition with them—and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei's Mate XT</a>.</p><p>The company's original teaser a couple of weeks ago echoed what we've seen fully explained today. TECNO stated its decision to go with an inward folding design was to shield its inner displays when "not in use." Moreover, the G-Style, snake-like folding design should further protect these delicate screens from "scratches and impacts."</p><p>Now, all we have to look forward to is MWC 2026 to see TECNO's latest G Fold concept in full (and in real life).</p> ]]></dc:content>

Think about the sensory aspect of a watch band, in addition to regular things like the price and style of the band. While the collection of Watch 8 compatible straps isn't as diverse as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Watch 7's quick-release bands</a>, what's on the market is more than sufficient.</p><p>Before shopping for Watch 8 bands, identify the sort of material you'd like to add to your collection. I like to have at least one fabric, one metal, and one rubber or silicone option with my primary wearable. This is a good framework to o by if you wear your smartwatch every day, wherever you go.</p><p>Since the Watch 8 already comes with a Classic Sport Band, you may or may not be interested in getting one. However, it's always a good idea to have a spare secondary color that you can switch to. This soft rubber band is gentle on the skin, easily adjustable, and durable, which is why it's the best overall pick when seeking out Watch 8 bands.</p><p>Next, consider spicing up your Samsung Galaxy Watch 8's wardrobe with a different texture. A metal band is a must-have. The Miimall Metal Band for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is astonishingly affordable, plus it comes in black and silver to match the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">colorways of the Watch 8</a>. Since it's made of stainless steel, it is not susceptible to rust. You get a screwdriver in the box, allowing you to open up links to manually adjust the size of the metal band at home. It's a fantastic budget buy.</p><p>Lastly, consider a fabric option like the durable Spigen Athlex Air or the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band. I use my Spigen woven band every day when working out, going to work, or just taking a leisurely stroll outdoors. While the one I use with my Pixel Watch isn't available for the Galaxy Watch 8, I am confident the Spigen Athlex Air will be just as rugged and comfortable. If you want something softer and elastic, the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band is also a great choice. And, it comes in a wide range of fun colors to boot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is something Pixel fans have been asking for for years, and it's nice to see Google delivering on that front. The Pixel 9 Pro was a mature leap forward in design, and it had some of the best AI features to come in an Android phone.</p><p>However, it wasn't without its flaws. The display still had a draconian PWM dimming rate; the processor simply wasn't suited for competitive gaming, and the measly 128GB base storage was a low blow for a phone that was more expensive than its predecessor.</p><p>All those who skipped the 2024 model in the hopes of getting the Pixel 10 Pro this year are probably not going to be too happy. The Pixel 10 series is expected sometime in August, and going by the leaks so far, it doesn't appear to be drastically different from the 9 Pro. This begs the question when comparing the Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro — is it really worth waiting for?</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our best look at the Pixel 10 Pro comes from this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">alleged hands-on photo</a> posted by Mystic Leaks. The phone looks virtually identical to the 9 Pro except for the rear camera bar, which looks visibly larger. This increase in size has seemingly been further confirmed thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Thinborne's new cases for the Pixel 10 series</a>, which are apparently already sold out.</p><p>It's unsurprising that Google hasn't made any drastic changes to the design, as it underwent a major overhaul just last year. I'm sure we'll see a few nips and tucks in the construction and layout of things, but the Pixel 10 Pro should largely look and feel the same. We would love a lower weight, though, as the 9 Pro is not exactly light at nearly 200g.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is already built extremely well, so there wasn't much to change in the first place. The front and back have Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch resistance, and there's an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The protruding rear camera island didn't win over everyone, and it remains on the 10 Pro as well. The Pixel 10 Pro should have the exact same weather resistance and rugged construction.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E" name="google-pixel-9-pro-in-hand-screen.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and a high pixel count of about 495 ppi. The one thing that we didn't like about it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">awful 240Hz PWM dimming rate</a>, which can cause severe headaches if you're eyes are sensitive to flicker. Pretty much everyone in the industry has moved to a higher PWM rate or has switched to DC dimming entirely, but not Google.</p><p>There's no evidence to suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro's display is going to be much different. This means we're looking at the same size, resolution, and brightness specs in all likelihood. There's a ray of hope, though, that Google might have fixed the PWM dimming issue in the 10 Pro. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> this April that its teams "are aware and investigating this" and that "you can expect updates later this year." This last piece of the puzzle could put the Pixel 10 Pro's display among the best, alongside the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no word on the pricing for the Pixel 10 Pro, but we expect the price of the smaller Pro to remain the same, considering Google raised it just last year. This means it should be $999 for the 10 Pro's 128GB, and there'll be two more storage tiers after this. The 10 Pro XL should be $100 more across variants, according to rumors. A recent leak suggests that Google might rejig the storage tiers of the XL model and start with 256GB. Honestly, I hope it does that for the standard Pro too, as 128GB is way too low these days, especially for a "Pro" phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is still sold at the above prices at most places, unless you purchase it during a sale or through your carrier. Once the Pixel 10 Pro hits shelves, though, the 9 Pro's price will come down. Whether it makes a good deal or not totally depends on the discount, but if it's not more than $100, you might as well spring for the 10 Pro.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,870mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Pixel 10 Pro is expected to feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> SoC, which is rumored to be a significant development as it may be the first SoC designed in-house by Google. Past Tensor chips have used Samsung's Exynos designs, which is why they have never been able to really compete with Qualcomm's offerings. All that should change with the Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>We should also expect a slight boost in battery capacity to 4,870mAh and a quicker wired charging speed of 29W. It's not much compared to what the competition offers, but it's a step in the right direction for Pixels. The cameras, on the other hand, are expected to remain largely unchanged. We'll likely have new features, but don't expect any significant changes to the sensors.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro doesn't perform well in heavy gaming, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip throttles quite noticeably. It's more efficient than the G3, but not a lot more powerful as far as raw performance goes. The cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro are fantastic and can deliver superb details and colors in pretty much all lighting conditions.</p><p>The haptics were something that really stood out, too, when we reviewed it. Battery life is also greatly improved over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> thanks to the more power-efficient SoC and optimized software.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro will most definitely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> as Google has already rolled out the stable release for the Pixel 9 series.

Considering it's rumored to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 Pro and with pre-order bonuses, the Pixel 10 Pro would be worth getting over the 9 Pro at the same price. Even if only a few of the rumors pan out like the improved performance of the Tensor G5 or the slightly larger battery, it's still a win-win if you're coming from a Pixel 8 Pro or older phone.</p><p>Gaming performance and the low PWM dimming display were our biggest gripes with the Pixel 9 Pro, but if these things don't bother you, you should wait for a price drop on the 9 Pro if you don't want to pay sticker price. The Pixel 9 Pro is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that has a lot going for it and is easier to recommend in 2025 if you can find a good deal.

Even manually added data wasn't working, as that still requires the platform's servers to be operable.

Specifically, Fitbit said, "We're experiencing a major outage," adding that it began around the time user reports appeared on Reddit this morning. Fortunately, as of 10:48 am EST, Fitbit states its mobile app and Web API services have returned "back to normal."

The list of spec improvements seems mostly rudimentary, like that boring phone "upgrade" you made that doesn't really feel any different from your old one. But then I stumbled upon Viture's Immersive 3D feature, which just debuted on Android a few short weeks ago.</p><p>Immersive 3D is a new software feature from Viture that automatically displays your favorite media in 3D without any kind of official support. You don't even need to convert it before watching! Plug your glasses into an Android phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viture.spacewalker">Spacewalker app</a>, then open YouTube, Hulu, or any photos and video stored on your phone itself, and be greeted with glorious 3D footage that wasn't 3D just a moment before.</p><p>I didn't expect this to work very well at all, considering it's just software-driven and many claims about AI enhancements have been overblown in the past. Apple has something similar on its <em>$3,500 headset</em>, but few want to pay that much for the experience. Meta also has something similar on its much more affordable $299 Quest 3S, but it's only easy to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">while scrolling Instagram</a>. Viture offers this Immersive 3D feature on <em>all</em> its glasses, including the <em>very</em> affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Glasses-Supported-Consoles-Adjustments/dp/B0CS2VZP6B/"><strong>$199 Viture Lite</strong></a>, with a single app install.</p><h2 id="3d-is-in-vogue-again-2">3D is in vogue again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3" name="viture-spacewalker-3d-photos" alt="A mockup provided by Viture showing what Immersive 3D photos look like in its Spacewalker app on Viture smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the increasing popularity of smart glasses, people have seemingly rediscovered 3D content again. The obvious issue is that, outside of a few videos and movies that were made over a decade ago when manufacturers were pushing 3D TVs, there's not a ton of native 3D content. There's not even a good way to just play games in 3D, even though that should be a relatively simple task in an era where millions of VR headsets are used every day.</p><p>That's where Immersive 3D comes in. It uses AI to calculate the depth of a 2D source, be it a video, photo, or even a game, although gaming is currently only available for very powerful gaming PCs at the moment. To get a sample of what gaming would feel like, I fired up a full playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy on YouTube and was blown away by the definition and detail I saw through Viture.</p><p>On Android and iOS, Immersive 3D is just another button to press in the Spacewalker app. On a PC or Mac, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academy.viture.com/xr_glasses/immersive_3d_windows">it's a separate app</a> to install and run. In my experience so far, it's much easier to use the feature on a PC or Mac since <em>everything</em> is converted to 3D, whereas you have to load up specific sources through the Spacewalker app on Android or iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd" name="viture-Spacewalker-launch-youtube" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bright side of having a dedicated app is that it's much easier to use. Running Immersive 3D on a PC or Mac is simpler and appears to "just work" after launch. I've been using a special pre-release version of Immersive 3D that works very well on Snapdragon X Elite PCs, but Viture says that gamers who want to use this should be using <em>at least</em> a GeForce RTX 4070, something I don't have access to.</p><p>Immersive 3D was released on Android only a month prior to me writing this, and the experience needs a little bit of work before it feels more natural to use. Spacewalker is a decent app and better than what's provided by other smart glasses companies, but that doesn't mean it's a <em>great</em> experience.</p><p>My biggest beef with it is that it doesn't support all apps on your phone; only a handful that Viture has ensured work through its built-in Firefox-based web browser. That's actually an Android security feature, not something Viture can easily bypass without you having root access to your phone. On Windows and Mac, it just works differently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd" name="viture-spacewalker-immersive-3d" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That also means services like Netflix won't work because there's no proper DRM translation through that web browser. Netflix works on the iOS version of Spacewalker with Immersive 3D, and Viture tells me it's working on compatibility for Android. At the very least, it's a reminder that this is still the early days of smart glasses technology, and the software needs further maturation.</p><p>After selecting one of the available services, or a local video or photo, a new hovering button will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen to launch Immersive 3D. Tap that, and the UI on your phone will change slightly, displaying the video's timeline at the bottom, along with a settings button that allows you to choose between three different 3D settings to optimize your experience.</p><p>Viture maintains a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosIlwOqL2KaartnAjhY15FD8nlAS3xBI">short YouTube playlist</a> and provides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SPN74tAM8aStTQIG6iHuFKl4Ys9i5VXw">a handful of example photos</a> that you can use to test out the automated 3D translation feature, all of which look <em>very</em> good.</p><h2 id="still-early-days-2">Still early days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn" name="viture-luma-pro-connected-to-spacewalker-app-on-oneplus-13" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It feels like I'm a broken record when I say "it's still early days," because I said this about VR gaming for the first several years until those titles hit their stride somewhere around 2020. The same mantra goes for XR hardware in general, including VR headsets and smart glasses, and I'm not sure the software side of the equation will be fully solved for smart glasses until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> starts shipping on them.</p><p>Now, the current Spacewalker process isn't terrible by any means, even if it is limited, but I've found it to be somewhat unreliable and just generally kind of clunky feeling. Several times while surfing through different YouTube videos, the Immersive 3D button would disappear. I usually had to completely shut down Spacewalker and reopen it to get the button back.</p><p>I've also found that it's finicky on some phones, but this isn't always Viture's fault. The app regularly crashed for me on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, while it ran on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> just fine. This is a fresh install on all these phones, so I know it's not some weird cache issue with an older version of the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4" name="viture-luma-pro-side-logo" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My hope is that Viture can get Spacewalker and/or Immersive 3D upgraded to support <em>all</em> Android apps, not just a very small, select few. This type of compatibility is exactly why Google is developing an entire operating system revolving around XR devices rather than just using an app, the way the company did in the Google Daydream days. I don't think this is possible because of OS-level security, though, and may require separate hardware or an Android XR app to make it happen.</p><p>For now, though, this is a really cool way to reexperience 3D content all over again, even if you don't opt to pay $499 for the latest Viture glasses. It'll be particularly interesting to see how well Immersive 3D holds up once Viture launches its official 3DoF/6DoF capabilities on the Viture Luma line of glasses, as a shifting perspective may not hold up as well with this 3D effect as the current pinned-in-place image does.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7c89492e-d16b-4c1a-ab72-e8dc7e95d04d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:84.53%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmK6AgpbTA8sbEbjDYSNNd.jpg' alt="An official product render of Viture Luma Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Viture Luma Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Viture Luma Pro are the best pair of smart glasses the company has ever made, featuring 1200p micro-OLED displays for each eye, a new adjustable frame design, IPD adjustment, and support for all of Viture's massive ecosystem of XR products.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Why would Samsung re-release a last-gen foldable? Since Motorola has been doing so well lately, it would seem that the Korean smartphone maker is trying to compete with the Razr and Razr Plus models. Motorola usually relaunches last year's Plus model as the new basic Razr, while the Plus model is the most improved new foldable. This has been a very successful strategy for the brand, and it seems like Samsung is trying to replicate that with the Flip 7 FE and Flip 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-all-colors-04.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are three main differences between the Flip 6 and its revamped Flip 7 FE re-release. To start with, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is much cheaper than the Flip 6. You can currently get the brand new Flip 7 FE with 256GB of storage for $900, however, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy">color choices are limited to Black and White</a>. Once the launch promo ends, it'll start at $900 for the 128GB version and $960 for the 256GB option. Both variants come with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was priced at $1,100 at launch for the base 256GB/12GB model. With the launch of the new Flip 7 series, you can easily score heavy discounts on the last-gen device, bringing the price down to $900 for the basic variant.</p><p>Memory and price aside, the third most notable difference between the Flip 7 FE and Flip 6 is the processor. The newer Flip 7 FE boasts a slower Exynos 2400 chipset, whereas the older Flip 6 has a superior Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d78d3b6d-9115-4e20-a38d-c402614b575a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJwtppW9DAGqVEQUiZRVhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's not all that new</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is the same as the Flip 6, so it can fit in the old-gen Flip's cases like a glove.

The Flip 7 FE is essentially an identical twin to the last-gen Galaxy Z Flip 6, but it's cheaper. The price cut comes with a less powerful Exynos processor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Flip 6 came in a multitude of colors</a>, ranging from punchy yellows to more sombre shades like black and white. The Flip 7 FE, however, has a much more disappointing number of colorways to offer. Let's take a good look at the options to help you decide which one you like the most.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy-2">What Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE color should you buy?</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="daf04d2f-b14d-4e04-91a3-ebc2349f943b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbHhKFZhdrMpQBn9V5dZhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE - Black</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All-black number</strong></em></p><p>You can't go wrong with a little black Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

I don't even know if we can call them colors because black and white feel devoid of it. Still, these are the only two options available for this foldable so you'll have to pick either one if you're dead set on getting the Flip 7 FE. Personally, I'd rather get the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a> with a more powerful processor and more diverse color options.</p><p>That being said, I find the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black looks much nicer than the White variant. Not only is it a low-maintenance shade that doesn't get as dirty, but it's also better at visibly minimizing the darkened bezels of the Flip 7 FE's cover screen. White clashes horribly with the fat black borders, enhancing the smallness of the display.</p><p>It's the same with the internal folding screen. Since the Flip 7 FE has the same old inner screen as the Flip 6, the bezels are just as noticeably big. Black bezels and a black frame make it appear as if the bezels are smaller, so you should think twice before placing your order for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in White.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The visualizations built by the system are really cool, too.</p><p>Using radar, high-speed drones, AI, and a lifetime of historical data gave us a neat look at the kinds of things baseball nerds love: batter's preferred "sweet spots", how weather can affect a ball's flight, where a ball would land at various stadiums and where a homer would land at Atlanta's Truist Park when the sluggers make that connection.</p><p>It's all done using pure data. Some is gathered in real-time using the drones and radar, but a lot of it is also historical. Everything in baseball is tracked; some fans can spout more facts than you would ever want to know. What's needed is a fast, accurate, and efficient way to parse it all. That's where AI comes in.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Imagine a giant spreadsheet that tells us what happened with every pitch of every game in the past 50 years. Was it a ball or a strike? How fast was the pitch? Did it break over the plate, and if so, where?</p><p>Then imagine an equally large spreadsheet from the batter's perspective. Did the ball cross the plate in the strike zone, and if so, where? How fast was it? How did the pitch break? Most importantly, did the batter connect with the pitch, and if so, where and how did the ball fly?</p><p>That's an insane amount of information. A perfectly pitched game still has 81 individual pitches, and you'll never see one. With hundreds of pitches and hundreds of games every year, the sheer amount of data is impossible for a person to analyze in real time.</p><p>That's what AI does best, though. Provide the right data for AI to look at, and it can tell you anything. If you tell AI about every seemingly insignificant stat from every single pitch in every MLB game, it can predict what will happen when presented with the real-time data of the current pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say Joe steps up to the plate for his second at-bat.

He swings in a low arc and smashes it! All the data from what happens when Bob throws that pitch at that speed across the plate at that spot is there for AI to analyze.</p><p>AI also has data telling it what happens when Joe hits a pitch at that spot and at that speed. Using this historical data, a projected path can be built. Compare that with real-time data collected by the drones and sensors to compensate for things like humidity, and AI has a very good idea of where that ball will land. It will tell us as it's happening, and we love it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB" name="Google-ai-server.jpg" alt="Google Tensor server backdrop on stage at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can expand those basics into everything, and it works mostly the same way. For example, you have historical data saved on your phone or in an online account profile. You have real-time data being gathered by your phone or your watch. AI uses the two to "create" an answer for almost any relevant question.</p><p>It can tell you if the sunset will be nice tonight at the beach. It can pair the latest photo you took with a past photo of the same subject for a nice collage. It can predict traffic patterns. It can even estimate when a piece of machinery will need servicing on an assembly line. The functional and useful information it provides uses the same types of patterns as predicting a home run at the All-Star game.</p><p>This is also why AI needs to be fast to be more useful. Telling us where a baseball landed isn't as useful as telling us where it will land, for example.

The original poster (OP), VHBlazer, states they received a $96 off discount for the NFL Sunday Ticket as a returning subscriber. The user states they typically subscribe and then kick it after March Madness.</p><p>This was reported earlier this week, and it seems it's still rolling out. Of course, there's likely some underlying conditions there.</p><p>While others have started receiving their emails, they report an interesting occurrence: the price discount is <em>not </em>always the same. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3bwia2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">few users who've been emailed</a> by YouTube TV in hopes of returning claim they've been offered $48 off, instead of $96. It's not exactly clear why there's this gap in discounts.</p><p>On the other hand, some users say they haven't received a "returning user" email, but attempting to return manually shows a discounted price. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3ccf53/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">even report getting the email</a>, yet trying to purchase still shows the full price undiscounted price. Perhaps contacting YouTube TV's support would be beneficial here.</p><h2 id="the-nfl-25-26-season-is-upon-us-2">The NFL '25-'26 Season is upon us</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/nfl_sunday_ticket_returning_subscriber_deal_96_off">NFL Sunday Ticket returning subscriber deal: $96 off</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Back in June, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/huge-youtube-tv-deals-nfl-sunday-ticket-games-2025-season-report">announced some major discounts</a> for new NFL Sunday Ticket holders interested in watching their first season. New consumers purchasing the Season Pass on YouTube can do so for $276, while those on YouTube's Primetime Channels will see it for $318.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the previous announcement didn't concern recurring or returning NFL Sunday Ticket holders at all. Those users would still see the same full-priced packages. Now, though, with the recent Reddit reports, perhaps YouTube TV is offering a little love to its older, unsubscribed crowd.</p><p>Also, YouTube TV's monthly payment option for the NFL season is rolling out in more States for more users. This should give users a little more flexibility with the NFL Sunday Ticket moving forward. Be warned: YouTube TV states Season Pass' monthly installment plan length will change from 12 months to eight as we near the beginning of the season in September.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While they haven't mentioned their source, the spec sheet seems quite thorough.</p><p>To start, the publication notes that the phone's cover display could be a bit larger than the previous model, measuring 6.4 inches. This could be due to the rumored reduction of the cover display’s bezel and the potential reworking of the hinge.  Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking about the device's battery, the leak suggests that it will show up with the largest non-silicon carbon battery, with 5,015mAh capacity and a bump from the 4,460mAh of the previous model. Which means users with this new foldable could use it for a couple more hours than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The massive battery will supposedly get a 23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging compatibility.</p><p>As many previous rumors have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> 3nm chipset. However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. According to the website, the phone will sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable, as indicated by a previous leak as well. And these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a></p><p>Lastly, Android Headlines claims that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first ever foldable to get an IP68 dust and water rating, which is much higher than the Samsung Z Fold 7's rating as well.</p><p>That said, as real as this may seem, this is still just a leak and must be taken with a grain of salt. However, the wait isn't for that long as Google officially announced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Pixel 10 series would be unveiled on Aug. 20 in New York.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>

We've had rumors about the former for a while, but this render suggests there are a couple of key changes inbound. First, the render purports some rather noticeable bezels around the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, seemingly similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">the Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>However, the tipster's image claims the tablet could see a slightly redesigned selfie camera cutout. Instead of the more boxy look, the Tab S11 Ultra render shows a smaller Infinity-U reminiscent display cutout. It looks like what you'd find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">budget Galaxy A26</a>. It remains to be seen if this new cutout takes away one of the Ultra's two selfie cameras or not. For reference, the Tab S11 Ultra features a 13MP wide and an 8MP ultrawide selfie lens.</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra's rear panel appears mostly the same—clean and clear—but there's one thing missing: the S Pen holder. Other users took note of this, as well, on X (formerly Twitter). It's kicked off some speculation, with some wondering if Samsung moved the strip to the top (side) of the tablet.</p><p>The tipster also highlighted the Galaxy S25 FE, which seems pretty much identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">the Galaxy S25</a> series. The only difference is that Samsung seems to have placed silver rings around its triple camera array, rather than the thicker black rings of the flagship models.</p><h2 id="more-samsung-2">More Samsung</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTS11U / GS25FE pic.twitter.com/yyqVXhzi6z<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1945437427692093702">July 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Rumors about Samsung's next tablet series have been pretty light, other than theories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">that it's dropping the Plus</a>, bringing only the base and Ultra models. The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">moving through Geekbench</a> for its performance tests, and it's said the model sports the boosted MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus chip. The chip is a refresh of MediaTek's answer to the Snapdragon 8 Elite from Qualcomm; however, the Tab S11 Ultra supposedly received a score "lower than smartphones."</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra might also see a battery boost. There was a report that claimed the tablet could jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy S25 FE was allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted grabbing Qi2 certification</a>, but the kicker was the WPC's real-life leaked snapshot of the phone. We got a clearer look at the phone's rear panel (and kind of the display), which showed off that small camera array change.</p><p>Samsung's summer Unpacked just went by, so we're looking ahead. The Galaxy S25 FE has been rumored to launch with the Galaxy Tab S11 series, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">reportedly happening "shortly." </a>There's a chance we could see these devices in August or September. The latter option is closer to the company's 2024 tablet reveal.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The improved heart rate sensor is substantially more accurate than that of the Watch 6, which is a good reason on its own to snag the watch while it's a little cheaper. It also boasts highly addictive double pinch gestures, health monitoring additions like medication interaction warnings, and a broad swath of Galaxy AI features that make it great.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$329.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>After this year's installment of Amazon Prime Day, the retailer has kept a solid 39% discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>, representing a whopping $130 off the normal purchase price.

From the highly accurate heart rate, health, and sleep monitoring systems to the easy-to-use Wear OS (now in its fourth generation), the Watch 7 is well-liked by most buyers, and there's a lot to like there. It gets between 30 and 50 hours of battery life per charge, depending on how it's used. And while it doesn't feature the fastest charging speeds in the industry, it makes up for that pretty quickly with its overall performance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

My Galaxy Watch 8 review unit, running One UI 8 Watch, had it from day one, so I've been testing it to see how the experience compares to the old Google Assistant or using Gemini on my phone.</p><p>Gemini recognizes natural language commands more dynamically, provides custom Google Search LLM responses instead of "Here's something I found" summaries, and syncs directly with your Google or Samsung apps so you can (for example) create a Google Calendar reminder or YouTube Music playlist via command.</p><p>My Pixel Watch 3 still runs Google Assistant at the time I'm writing this, so it became my control group against my Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's Gemini. And while I can't say my Gemini experience was perfect, it's certainly a major improvement.</p><h2 id="gemini-on-wear-os-is-a-noticeable-upgrade-over-assistant-2">Gemini on Wear OS is a noticeable upgrade over Assistant</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Assistant" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3276" height="1843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's a relevant example. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> has a new antioxidant index that measures carotenoids, the pigments in fruits and veggies that help prevent premature aging and chronic illnesses. So I asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Assistant which foods have the most carotenoids.</p><p>Assistant unhelpfully quoted a Mayo Clinic article that confirmed "fruits, vegetables, and whole grains" have carotenoids. Gemini gave actual specifics, then let me create a Google Keep shopping list with the suggested produce pasted.</p><p>I'm also able to ask random on-the-spot questions about things like "the history of carrier pigeons in 30 seconds" and get a relevant, concise answer. I like to skip past the Search AI summary to the actual articles on my laptop browser, but this LLM data is well-suited to on-the-go insights.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My friend told me he loved the new Superman movie, so I asked both assistants about the critical reception. Google Assistant quoted a pithy Rotten Tomatoes' summary, while Gemini offered more nuance and detail about which aspects reviewers liked and disliked.</p><p>More importantly, I asked Gemini for showtimes at my closest theater on Saturday — it pulled data from Search and Maps simultaneously, then had it create a Google Calendar entry for a specific showing and send my fiancée an invite. Google Assistant can do a lot of this <em>individually</em>, but can't multitask in the same way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini asks Galaxy Watch owners which app they want to default to, such as Samsung Reminders / Google Tasks or Google / Samsung Messages. Once you choose your default apps and give Gemini access, everything speeds up. I had Gemini create reminders, summarize emails, and search for a good nearby Italian restaurant before opening walking directions to it.</p><p>Google Assistant also has some integration with Google apps; Gemini isn't reinventing the wheel. But Gemini does do things more seamlessly and has fewer instances where it "doesn't understand" or can't fulfill my request.</p><h2 id="how-gemini-on-wear-os-can-get-even-better-2">How Gemini on Wear OS can get even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini on Wear OS feels pretty polished, considering it's only just launched. I worried about its battery impact, but dozens of Gemini commands and the always-listening "Hey Google" setting only burned about 20% of my Watch 8 Classic battery across a full afternoon. That's faster than normal drain, but even heavy use won't stop you from getting over a day per charge.</p><p>That said, I think Gemini on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> can get even better! It occasionally gets things wrong and has leaps in logic, but that's normal for LLMs. I have more concrete requests.</p><p>I started adding "in 30 seconds" to info requests because Gemini's long, meandering answers take minutes to read, which isn't always suitable when out and about. Tapping the display silences the AI so you can read the full answer yourself, but I think this version of Gemini might focus more on brevity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-website-links" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini response with websites for a nearby restaurant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There should be a "View on phone" button at the bottom of Gemini replies. As dynamic as this version of Gemini is, there does come a point when pulling out my phone is less time-consuming, and Wear OS should make that transition easier.</p><p>For example, I can ask the Wear OS Gemini for good nearby Indian restaurants and get a list of answers, but it won't show hyperlinks like it does on mobile. I finally got it to share a link to the menu that opened up on my Galaxy phone, but not before a couple of failed attempts where it tried to open the "Naan N Curry app" on my phone.</p><p>Also, unlike the more conversational <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, the Gemini assistant can be bad at knowing when I'm done talking, cutting me off mid-command or halfway through a message. I understand that people don't want to wait around too long, but the AI should be a little more patient.</p><p>Lastly, if and when Google starts supporting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">One UI 8 Watch Tile format</a> for its own apps, I'd like to see a scrolling Gemini Tile with room for more than two saved commands; ideally, it'd show your recent commands, too, so you could pick up where you left off.</p><p>Overall, replacing Assistant with Gemini is a major net positive. I simply hope that Google continues to optimize this version of the assistant in future updates!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ced8c3e7-59dd-4ce6-86dc-42f4ef06ddd0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4tmhPs8yGBuoHYFfdrVvW6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>New kind of Classic</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic isn't the only Wear OS watch with Gemini, but its fast processor is primed to answer questions speedily, and you'll read responses on its 3,000-nit display.

The post states the update has started as of July 15, and is expected to "reach all devices over the coming weeks." While the OnePlus 13 and 13R don't feature the dedicated Plus Key like the 13s, the post states users with the former can activate Plus Mind using a "three-finger swipe up" on their displays.</p><p>As the update appears, users will soon notice a new Mind Space app appear on the 13 and 13R. Details highlight your ability to send a "wide variety" of information into Plus Mind. OnePlus states this includes your texts, images, webpages, social media posts, and more. What you capture via the screen gesture will be sent to the Mind Space app.</p><p>Additionally, the AI analysis of your content can spot and understand dates and suggest that you put them into your calendar for later.</p><p>For fashion, OnePlus says Plus Mind can "summarize the styles shown" and save that summary within Mind Space with a direct link, so you can revisit it. If there's a lot of content in your Mind Space app, OnePlus says you can leverage AI Search on the 13 and 13R to find things. Knowing the gist of what you're looking for, and also <em>when </em>you might've saved it, can help the AI return useful stored content.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-smart-one-2">It's a smart one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF" name="OnePlus-AI-Plus-Key" alt="OnePlus AI Plus Key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the OnePlus 13s was on its way, it was made evident that the company had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">ditched the Alert Slider</a> in favor of a new Plus Key. As previously stated, the feature primarily focuses on your screenshots—and placing them in a unique space (Mind Space), so they're not cluttering your memories in the Gallery. Plus Mind's AI suggestions piggyback off OnePlus AI to make saving important dates, locations, and more a breeze.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-launching-in-india-on-july-5">compact flagship is available in India</a>, which meant the rest of us were left waiting (and wondering) if we'd ever see something similar. Users in India are also enjoying AI VoiceScribe, a feature that lets users record, summarize, and translate phone calls and meetings. The Chinese OEM's AI suite has continued to evolve, as we have AI Translation, Search, Reframe, and Perfect Shot to play with.</p><p>However, OnePlus states that there's "more to come," and Plus Mind on the 13 and 13R is a "step in that direction."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vivo proved last year that it knows how to deliver an all-round package with a sleek design, amazing cameras, and good software features.</p><p>With the X Fold 5, it isn't changing things too much; if anything, the phone is nearly identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold 3 Pro</a>. Coming in at 4.3mm, it is among the thinnest tech products you can buy today, but it just misses out on being the thinnest foldable — that honor goes to the 4.2mm Magic V5.</p><p>However, Vivo put a bigger 6,000mAh battery in its foldable, and that ensures the device easily lasts a day even with heavy use. And at 217g, it is 12g lighter than the X200 Ultra, and that in itself highlights just how much foldables have evolved in recent years. Like last year, Vivo is making the X Fold 5 available in several Asian countries, but it won't debut outside the region.</p><p>Having used the X Fold 5 as my daily driver, I'm convinced that it is one of the best foldables you can buy in 2025 — provided you're in a country where Vivo sells the device.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold-5-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X Fold 5: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X Fold 5 alongside the new X200 FE on July 14, and the devices are slated to go on sale in select Asian countries over the coming weeks.

There is enough width along the sides to hold the foldable comfortably, and the hinge has smooth articulation. If anything, the hinge has better durability this time around, and it stays unlocked at any angle between 45 and 150 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cCJFquE4miGWeKD4ukbzQ3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cCJFquE4miGWeKD4ukbzQ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most manufacturers are focusing on sleek designs this year, and the X Fold 5 comes in at just 4.3mm while unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. To give you some context, the X200 Ultra is 8.7mm, so the X Fold 5 is only a smidgen bulkier than a regular phone. In fact, you don't even notice that you're using a foldable when interacting with the cover panel, and that is the biggest difference with the latest-gen foldables — they're not unwieldy in the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EBCjuabhaMnWqgY9cePtW3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBCjuabhaMnWqgY9cePtW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is also lighter than most regular phones at 217g, and what I like is that Vivo somehow managed to bring IP58 and even IP59 ingress protection to the X Fold 5.

Vivo says it is about delivering the right "balance and efficiency," but the manufacturer didn't go into detail as to why it didn't use the 3nm-based 8 Elite over the 4nm 8 Gen 3. It's entirely likely that it wanted to undercut Samsung and Honor, so it utilized last year's platform.</p><p>Thankfully, the 8 Gen 3 still has plenty of power, and I didn't see any slowdowns in the week I used the X Fold 5. It handled demanding games and visually-intensive titles without any issues, and I didn't see much in the way of overheating either. That said, it tends to throttle significantly earlier than regular phones powered by the same silicon. This is the case with other foldables I tested; they just don't have the same thermal management systems, so they tend to throttle sooner to avoid heating issues.</p><div ><table><caption></caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OPPO Find N5</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X Fold 5</p></th><th  ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2625</p></td><td  ><p>2184</p></td><td  ><p>1600</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7201</p></td><td  ><p>6330</p></td><td  ><p>5293</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2505</p></td><td  ><p>3326</p></td><td  ><p>2923</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5252</p></td><td  ><p>3740</p></td><td  ><p>4032</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>31.45</p></td><td  ><p>22.4</p></td><td  ><p>24.14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>9898</p></td><td  ><p>5711</p></td><td  ><p>7927</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>37.64</p></td><td  ><p>21.72</p></td><td  ><p>30.14</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The vibration motor delivers good feedback, and like last year, Vivo is selling a single 16GB/512GB edition of the device in global markets.

It utilizes silicon-carbon tech, delivering much better density and longevity. With a density of 866Wh/L, it is the densest cell you'll get on a foldable, and Vivo did all the right things in this area.</p><p>I had no issues getting the X Fold 5 to last all day even with heavy use. This was a problem on last year's foldables where they needed to be plugged in before the end of the day, but that just isn't the case this time around. While 80W charging isn't as good as the 100W standard from last year, there isn't much in the way of a difference in real-world usage. The foldable took an hour to charge, and unlike Samsung, you get a charger in the box.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold-5-cameras"><span>Vivo X Fold 5: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qU699whHSLyhuU5hviApT3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qU699whHSLyhuU5hviApT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>You get three 50MP cameras at the back with Zeiss tuning. </strong></li><li><strong>It has the best cameras of any foldable right now. </strong></li></ul><p>Vivo slotted in a 50MP Sony IMX921 as the main camera on the X Fold 5, and it is joined by a 50MP Samsung JN1 module that acts as the wide-angle lens, and a 50MP Sony IMX882 as the tele lens with 3x optical zoom.

It may not be at the same level as the X200 Pro, but it is better than every other foldable I used. Daylight shots have good detail and colors, and it holds up just as well in challenging situations, producing vibrant photos with minimal noise levels.</p><p>The auxiliary cameras are pretty good too, and like every other Vivo phone I tested in 2025, you get standout portrait shots.

The UI itself is fluid, and I didn't see any issues in the week I used the X Fold 5. I prefer Funtouch OS to ColorOS or OxygenOS now, and that's one of the reasons why I used the X200 Pro as my daily driver for a good chunk of 2025.

Compare that to your current phone bill and tell me it doesn't sound good. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want Unlimited wireless for dirt cheap; you don&apos;t mind paying for a full year of service in advance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to a year of one wireless plan; you need more perks or you regularly use over 35GB of data in a month. </p><p>Owned and operated by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile is a popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that works by selling its wireless in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time. Although you have to pay a bit more for the wireless upfront, it generally becomes quite cheap once you break the costs down month to month. This makes Mint a convenient choice for folks who want to drop a chunk of cash and not think about their phone bill again for a while.</p><p>As described above, the Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. High-speed data is technically capped at 35GB per month, after which speeds <em>could</em> slow if the network becomes congested. Aside from a free mobile hotspot and a few international benefits, there also aren&apos;t as many perks as you might get from other wireless carriers, but that&apos;s a small price to pay when you consider the value here. </p><p>I&apos;ll put it this way: Mint is a simple, affordable carrier for folks who want simple, affordable wireless. And if you&apos;ve been thinking about switching anyway, this deal presents an outstanding opportunity. </p><h2 id="need-a-new-phone-too-2">Need a new phone too?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:204px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.08%;"><img id="Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV" name="google-pixel-9-render-obsidian.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="204" height="247" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799"><del>$799</del> <strong>$359, plus BOGO year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Mint is also home to a ton of great phone deals, such as this offer that slashes over 50% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND throws in a free year of Unlimited when you bundle the purchase of the phone with one year of service.</p><p>In other words, you're getting a top-rated flagship phone along with two full years of T-Mobile-powered wireless for only $719 (or $30 per month when you pay using affirm). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li> <strong>More MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a> </li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The survey runs through the typical checks and balances; however, the publication noticed two important questions, each regarding Qi2 wireless charging and its magnetic hardware.</p><p>Arguably, the most important question is number 38, which says, "Would you prefer to have magnets built into the phone even if it made the phone thicker?" Two of the answers say you wouldn't mind Qi2 magnets within the device, even if it made the phone "within 0.3mm" or "within 0.5mm" larger. These aren't outlandish differences, especially considering Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">thin phone era</a>, but that tech inside would <em>slightly </em>enlarge things.</p><p>The publication details another option that says you wouldn't want Qi2 magnets inside if it made the phone larger, while the final choice says "magnets must be included," no matter the increase.</p><p>The other question poses an interesting scenario: what if a Galaxy phone <em>only </em>had wireless charging? Samsung asks, "if only wireless charging is supported, would having Qi2 (like MagSafe) reduce any inconveniences?"</p><h2 id="samsung-qi2-2">Samsung & Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's recent history with Qi2 on the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">has been incredibly confusing</a>, but it all boils down to a simple answer. Samsung's latest flagship series is the first set of phones to feature "Qi2 Ready support;" however, these devices don't feature the required magnets within themselves. So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">yes, the Galaxy S25 series offers wireless charging</a>, thanks to Qi2, but only at 15W.</p><p>If you're interested in grabbing a Qi2 charger, the Galaxy S25 series will be compatible with it. One thing you should note is that, without the magnets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">you will need a case</a> that brings the necessary built-in magnets for that.</p><p>Perhaps we can speculate that Samsung dropped these magnets to make its series thinner, especially after seeing the recent consumer survey. That's not exactly confirmed, so it's just food for thought. There's also no telling when/if Samsung would even provide built-in magnets for its devices. The Galaxy S26 series comes to mind. We'd only hear something actionable early next year, if it does.</p><p>The company's rumored Galaxy S25 FE was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted moving through the WPC</a> for wireless charging, to which it received Qi2 (v2.1) certification. However, given speculation that says we might see this phone later this year, we might not see these built-in magnets for this model. If anything, the S25 FE will fit closer to the others with 15W wireless charging and the necessity for a case.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Kang praised the foldables, stating they are "perfect hardware innovations that perfectly complete the first generation of foldables and open up the next generation."</p><p>One of the most substantial changes occurred within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which thinned down to 8.9mm (unfolded) and 4.2mm (folded). Kang states this was a product of consumers wanting something "thin and light." However, Samsung understands that not everyone may enjoy its sacrifices: notably, the S Pen. Samsung is reportedly looking into R&D means for new technologies within a future S Pen to make it thinner.</p><p>For now, Kang states consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding, "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><p>The publication highlights Kang's additional statement, claiming Samsung won't do anything that sticks until there's a certain level of "perfection." Moreover, "consumer demand" is another major catalyst behind the S Pen's potential return. The post mentions the Fold 7's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">Armor Flex Hinge</a>, which is lighter and thinner than the Fold 6's hinge, further facilitating a slimmer phone.</p><h2 id="the-s-pen-lingers-2">The S Pen lingers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7 was also discussed, as Samsung finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">provided it with a full cover display</a> (4-inch) that reaches edge-to-edge for a more immersive experience. Samsung worked in a more "compact" form factor for the device, while also boosting its battery by ~300mAh to 4,300mAh.</p><p>You may remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">some earlier rumors</a> that said the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would debut with a standalone S Pen that required charging. That didn't happen. The reason for this memory jog is that rumors claimed this S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">would need to be charged</a> (since there's no digitizer), <em>and </em>the pen would be slightly larger. Speculation claimed Samsung was looking into adding active electrostatic (AES) technology so the pen could manage its own operations. Such additions would likely expand its size, but taking into account Kang's comments, perhaps Samsung is moving in a different direction.</p><p>For now, our current reality is this: the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has no S Pen. If you're interested in that useful tool, you'll have to look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Samsung's executive vice president and head of customer experience, Patrick Chomet, once told CNET, "We could put it in, but it's not the main feedback from people, and therefore getting it thinner and lighter is more important."</p><p>This pretty much echoes what Kang Min-seok said after Samsung's summer Unpacked. Chomet added, "Many people use the S Pen, but far from the majority of users."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The issue has been reported to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://0din.ai/blog/phishing-for-gemini" target="_blank">0din</a>, Mozilla’s AI-focused bug bounty program (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-gemini-flaw-hijacks-email-summaries-for-phishing/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>).</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">slipped Gemini into its Workspace apps a while back</a>, and one of its handy tricks is breaking down your emails. Just slide open the side panel in Gmail, and Gemini will be able to pull key details or turn messages into calendar events on the fly.</p><p>But here’s the scary part: this feature also opens the door to “prompt-injection” attacks. If someone slips a sneaky prompt into an email, Gemini might run it right in the side panel, and the user might not even notice.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2381px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.82%;"><img id="LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2381" height="1972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.20%;"><img id="DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2620" height="2206" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Hackers can hide secret commands in emails using simple HTML and CSS tricks like white text on a white background or font size zero. You won’t notice a thing, but Gemini will read it loud and clear, and that’s where things can go sideways.</p><p>Since these sneaky emails skip the usual red flags (no sketchy links or shady attachments), they often slip right past Google’s spam filters and land straight in your inbox.</p><h2 id="wolf-in-google-s-clothing-2">Wolf in Google’s clothing</h2><p>Gemini sees those hidden prompts as legit and spits them out in the email summary with zero warnings. Since it’s coming from Google’s own AI, it looks totally above board, which means most folks won’t even think to question it. That false sense of trust is what makes this so dangerous.</p><p>According to BleepingComputer, even though prompt injection has been on the radar since 2024 and some guardrails are already in place, this tactic still works. That means the current defenses aren’t quite keeping up with how crafty attackers are getting.</p><p>Google says there’s no sign of hackers actually using this trick in real-world attacks thus far. But the research clearly shows it can be done, which raises a big red flag. Just because it hasn’t hit the wild yet doesn’t mean it’s not a serious threat waiting to happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>
