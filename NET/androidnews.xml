You can also trade in brands like Fitbit, Garmin, Google, Apple, or Oura.</p><p>Amazon is also offering a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0FCNWNPMR/?th=1"><strong>$100 gift card with the Classic through August 5</strong></a>, but we don't see the same trade-in offers, so it's only the right fit if you don't plan to send in your old smartwatch.

According to the publication, Google has supposedly moved the watch's charging pins to the left side of its body. The post states that the left side will feature an "indentation" with "two charging contacts" inside.</p><p>Now, it's expected that the Pixel Watch 4 will sit on its left side to charge, meaning the display can now face users, almost like a mini-clock.</p><p>The publication also revealed a rumored rendering of the charging cable and holder for the Pixel Watch 4. It seems the charging cradle will feature a small dip to accommodate the Pixel Watch 4's circular body.</p><p>It also shows the two spaces where those side-mounted charging contact points will likely sit.</p><h2 id="expected-to-advance-2">Expected to Advance</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.12%;"><img id="GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b" name="pixel-watch-4-side-mounted-charging-leaked-example" alt="An alleged rendering of the Pixel Watch 4 sitting on its left side where its charging contact points have supposedly moved to." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GGErSKzdy6w5zz5cRgrv6b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="832" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:818px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.35%;"><img id="BCCCitBbNA8WQHiM4uMx9b" name="pixel-watch-4-side-mounted-charging-cradle-side-mouted-leak" alt="A leaked render of the Pixel Watch 4's alleged charging dock, which will hold the device from its side, instead of flat on its back." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCCCitBbNA8WQHiM4uMx9b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="818" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This isn't the first time we've heard something <em>curious </em>about the Pixel Watch 4's charging; remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-renders-leak-indicate-thicker-build-and-removal-of-charging-pins">its massive render leak</a> from April. On the surface, the renders purport that Google will stick with its design from the past three generations: a circular watch face and a crown on the right side. However, these renders claim the Pixel Watch 4 will sport thinner bezels, potentially moving us closer to the dream we all have for Google's smartwatch.</p><p>One aspect of these renders that caught some eyes was that the Pixel Watch 4's back panel seemingly lacked its charging pins. It was previously assumed that these two indents on the device's older renders were buttons, but theories have veered toward charging.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to have 41mm and 45mm variants, just like the Pixel Watch 3. However, the device is reportedly slightly thicker than before. This leads to speculation that Google could pack an even bigger battery into the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>Elsewhere, pricing has become the object of consumer concerns, which is where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/looks-like-the-pixel-watch-4-wont-hit-your-wallet-as-hard-as-people-thought">rumors from mid-July</a> come in. There's a chance that Google will keep its Pixel Watch 4 pricing similar to the Pixel Watch 3. As a refresher, the Pixel Watch 3 saw the following prices: $349 (41mm Wi-Fi model), $399 (LTE), $399 ( 45mm Wi-Fi), and $449 (45mm LTE).</p><ul><li><strong>Smartwatch deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=smartwatch&_dyncharset=UTF-8&_dynSessConf=&id=pcat17071&type=page&sc=Global&cp=1&nrp=&sp=&qp=&list=n&af=true&iht=y&usc=All+Categories&ks=960&keys=keys"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=smartwatch"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatch&crid=19YAPQ38561AK&sprefix=smartwatch%2Caps%2C138&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_1_10"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/watches-audio-accessories-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/smartwatch"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

When you're paying this much for a phone, you expect it to be amongst the best, and that simply hasn't been the case. Samsung went back to the drawing board with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Fold 7</a>, in more ways than one, but finally swapped out the 50MP wide-angle lens in favor of a 200MP sensor.</p><p>So what better way to find out whether the Galaxy Z Fold 7's camera is actually better than by comparing it to a bunch of other phones? But, I didn't just pick any phones; specifically, we have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p><p>For the sake of transparency, all of the pictures were taken using the default settings, and none of the photos included have been edited.</p><h2 id="battle-of-the-foldables-2">Battle of the foldables</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmK4mb37DfKX9N32og3mob" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmK4mb37DfKX9N32og3mob.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">I prefer</a> Samsung's "kitchen sink" approach in terms of software features, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been my phone of choice for quite a while. Sadly, it fell short of the Fold 7 in the above comparison, as the setting sun was just too much for it to handle. As a result, the picture is more blown out, with the picture having a kind of orange tint.</p><p>The Fold 6 did better than I expected, as you can still tell that the sky is blue and there isn't a weird tint overlay. On the downside, it looks like the Fold 6 would be perfect for Director J.J. Abrams with its lens flare. Not only do we get one that spans the edges of the image from the sun, but there are some smaller flares from the sun's reflection in the water.</p><p>Honestly, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 just wins by default here. Nothing stands out in terms of negative effects, and it was able to avoid the pitfalls of the other two. But there also isn't much helping it stand out otherwise.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy Fold 7</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="r2rBTnqicTiupNPjg75PZc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r2rBTnqicTiupNPjg75PZc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was also one of the tougher comparisons to pick a winner for. All three phones were to 5x zoom, which means that Samsung's Fold 6 and Fold 7 are at the mercy of digital zoom, with this being one of the defaults of the Pixel.</p><p>I quickly counted out the Fold 6 as the AI "smooth over" effect is apparent in the text of the building. Even with the image colors looking pretty true-to-life, the obvious AI boost compared to the other two was the deciding factor.</p><p>I've looked at these pictures longer than any others in this comparison, and I'm still not sure either the Fold 7 or 9 Pro Fold is better than the other. There is a bit of a tint on the front of the building from the setting sun, but it's not far off from the way it looked to the naked eye.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Fold 7 produced a cooler image with just a slight tint on the white letters. Both phones do a good job of preserving textures and clarity, leaving the rest to each phone's color profile. Which means, both phones are the winners here.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner:</strong> <strong>Tie between Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TkLtPTroQ44LQNp2U8Ebjc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkLtPTroQ44LQNp2U8Ebjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last up, I maxed out the image resolution for all three phones, then zoomed in as far as I could to the sign you see in the image above. This gave me a good idea of which phone leaned more heavily on processing, versus just taking the picture.</p><p>At first glance, it might seem like the Fold 6 is the best, simply based on the brighter image that was produced. The Fold 7 was the next brightest, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold being the darkest of the bunch.</p><p>While that might be enough for some people, the real story is told when you look more closely at the sign itself. Despite producing the brightest picture, it also has the most AI artifacting of the bunch. It's almost like the phone was trying to put an overlay of the letters, but was off-center by a bit.</p><p>The Fold 7 did a pretty good job overall, as the sign is still legible, but it does look like Samsung's smooth-over processing got the best of the hardware. As for the Pixel, well, it got everything right, even if the phone didn't manage to capture as much light as its counterparts.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Pixel 9 Pro Fold</strong></li></ul><p>Below, you'll find a few more side-by-side comparisons if you want a few other examples of how these foldable phones stack up.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sccndUYXwpcz3bvWdjHr7c" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sccndUYXwpcz3bvWdjHr7c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ardMGvaRxKZ5hWQwpHyxac" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ardMGvaRxKZ5hWQwpHyxac.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f6CeTLXrG6jtXoEBkuaEdc" name="zf7-zf6-p9pf-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Pixel 9 Pro Fold Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f6CeTLXrG6jtXoEBkuaEdc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="foldable-vs-slabs-2">Foldable vs. Slabs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Dj9DNTZzDtmE3W7SS22nb" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-7" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Dj9DNTZzDtmE3W7SS22nb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In an effort to "put my money where my mouth is," the Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max joined the other phones on this adventure. These are still two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best camera phones</a> that money can buy, even if you broaden the scope beyond the confines of North America.</p><p>With this first test, I was a bit surprised to find that I preferred the Fold 7 out of the three. Usually, I lean more towards cooler-toned pictures, but both the iPhone and S25 Ultra ended up as backups for the next Abrams film.</p><p>Curiously, instead of the "linear" lens flare found in the S25 Ultra's picture, the iPhone produced a lone dot off to the bottom left, along with a cluster right behind where the sun reflects off of the water. I don't know why this happened or what explanation there could be, but even with its darker tones, the Fold 7 was my favorite here.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JPAxQCrYFd784oDhN9M8sc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JPAxQCrYFd784oDhN9M8sc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This was almost another "too close to call" comparison, but not because of the S25 Ultra. This time, it was between the iPhone and the Fold 7, as these two phones produced a bit more detail compared to the S25 Ultra. I honestly didn't even notice it at first, until I looked at the base for the sundial.</p><p>Yet again, there's just a bit too much of a smoothing effect going on with the S25 Ultra, which is definitely not something that I expected. To be fair, the same effect seems to be applied with the Fold 7, but to a lesser degree. Meanwhile, you can see a lot of the blemishes and wear from the iPhone's picture, resulting in a more true-to-life image.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: iPhone 16 Pro Max</strong></li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bGQ6mREtfxkcPmPXwnj7mc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGQ6mREtfxkcPmPXwnj7mc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the same way that I did in the previous section, I cranked up the image resolution and zoomed in on the sign.

The S25 Ultra gave me a picture that was almost exactly what I was seeing in front of me in terms of the color tones, as seen in the grass.</p><p>The slight hint of AI enhancement on the sign is what dragged the Fold 7 down, but I'd probably put it in a 2nd-place tie with the iPhone as the rest of the picture looks pretty darn good.</p><ul><li><strong>Winner: Galaxy S25 Ultra</strong></li></ul><p>Here are a few more comparisons if you want to see how well the Fold 7 fared against the S25 Ultra and 16 Pro Max.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uBtyVLxkAtYMwxhDBuCtic" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-5" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uBtyVLxkAtYMwxhDBuCtic.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sWpWefrtpGqZNwsBEV84Yc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-6" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWpWefrtpGqZNwsBEV84Yc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L7GZi8W9TRcoKVtthsC8Uc" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L7GZi8W9TRcoKVtthsC8Uc.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kz4gceb6WSunX92m6LrC8c" name="zf7-s25u-16pm-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra vs. iPhone 16 Pro Max Camera Comparison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kz4gceb6WSunX92m6LrC8c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="is-there-a-winner-2">Is there a winner?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4908px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="taZSyh6Ywwh2Fjzj8JGZsR" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-5" alt="View of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera behind a sundial" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taZSyh6Ywwh2Fjzj8JGZsR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4908" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not to be cheesy, but yes, there is a winner.

It's been a pioneer in the space for years, but the company has also seemingly figured out the formula to keeping its customer base happy and coming back. But with the Galaxy Z Fold 7, this might be the first time in years that Samsung has figured out a way to entice even more people.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, I've hoped Samsung would continue leading the charge for book-style foldables. Instead, we've seen the likes of Vivo, Honor, OPPO/OnePlus, and others show off what's really possible, while Samsung moved further and further down the bench.</p><p>That all changed when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition</a> launched late in 2024, arriving just a couple of months after the Fold 6. At the time, I posited that this was "what the Galaxy Z Fold 6 should've been," but opted against for whatever reason. As it turns out, that was just a teaser for what was to come, but now that the main course has been served, is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> the flagship foldable we've been wanting?</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-specs-and-pricing"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Specs and Pricing</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 was announced on July 9 during the mid-2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-live-blog-july-2025">Galaxy Unpacked</a> event.

It's almost like this isn't even a Samsung device, especially considering how much of a drastic difference there is compared to last year's model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="haGtyLUZAdYMPTDSAeTDDZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-9" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/haGtyLUZAdYMPTDSAeTDDZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, there are a couple of annoyances that keep picking at me. The first of which is the fingerprint scanner mounted on the outer frame. To me, it just doesn't feel as tactile or prominent as previous Fold models, even with the button itself protruding, as opposed to being inset with a bit of a moat around it.</p><p>As such, I end up fumbling around more just trying to make sure my finger is in the right place. Thankfully, when the stars align, I've yet to actually have any issues with the scanner's functionality.</p><p>My other issue is that along with the other sacrifices made for the sake of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 being as thin as possible, Samsung almost made it impossible to actually use the inner screen.

Which ultimately isn't much different than if I were using the S25 Ultra.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qngunHUgpL3fAbMi89rYhT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-18" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qngunHUgpL3fAbMi89rYhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other nifty change has been an optimized interface for Gemini when using the primary display. When activated, the search bar appears in the bottom left corner, keeping it mostly out of the way, which has been nice whenever I remember to actually use it.</p><p>Besides that, the One UI 8 experience is about as ho-hum as it gets. However, there is one particular change that is maddening — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Classic Samsung DeX</a> is gone. In its place, we have the "New DeX" that was introduced a couple of years ago, providing a more simplistic and less desktop-like experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4238px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.66%;"><img id="bynsRDkbYZycNC2sPLrgfT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bynsRDkbYZycNC2sPLrgfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4238" height="2825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Functionally, DeX works just fine, but I wish Samsung would've just left well-enough alone. If I'm using the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a>, it's probably because I'm trying to get some work done, where a desktop experience is better suited. And while this "New DeX" makes sense as the default layout on the Galaxy Tab, it's not like you can access it on the Fold 7 without an external display.</p><p>I'm sure it was done to align with Google's forthcoming addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Desktop Mode for Pixel phones</a>, which debuted at I/O 2025 and is slated to arrive with Android 16 QPR1 later this year.

However, Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">announced</a> its Made by Google event for August 16, where it's expected to unveil the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, along with other new devices. The rumors and leaks suggest a more modest upgrade this time around, meaning that Samsung probably doesn't have too much to worry about.</p><p>When we broaden the spectrum to beyond the confines of the U.S., it's a very different story. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review" target="_blank">Vivo's X Fold 5</a> recently launched in select countries, bringing with it a design that's almost just as slim as the Fold 7. And despite using last year's chip, the X Fold 5 beats out the Fold 7 with battery life, and a camera system that's described as being "the best cameras of any foldable right now."</p><p>Then, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>, which was launched shortly after the Galaxy S25 Ultra back in February. This is the highly-anticipated successor to the Find N3 from 2023, which, alongside the OnePlus Open, set a new standard for many foldable phones. While we didn't see the Open 2, the Find N5 remains one of the best phones of the year, and not just in the foldable market.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7: Should You Buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5284px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQSNHarYqtCMB9R36fWydT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5284" height="2972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the thinnest foldable phone</li><li>You're upgrading from any previous Galaxy Z Fold, including last year's model</li><li>You want the best foldable phone in North America (for now)</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You rely on the S Pen</li><li>You want a phone with a bigger battery</li></ul><p>Despite the annoyances and concerns, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the first Samsung foldable that I would wholly recommend to anyone who asks.

Plus, I <em>still</em> can't get over just how thin the Fold 7 actually is. I know I'm a bit jaded to the limited competition, but still. It's crazy.</p><p>That being said, it's not going to come cheap, as the upgrades result in another price jump, with the base model coming in at $1,999.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> is a more well-rounded device than its predecessor in almost every way, with bigger screens, more battery life, and a thinner design. However, if you've used a Flip before, you'll know size was never the biggest thing limiting the cover screen's utility — software restrictions were.</p><p>I switched back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> about two weeks before my Galaxy Z Flip 7 review unit arrived, and I've been daily driving the new model for a few days now. As it turns out, the bigger 4.1-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 hasn't been the game-changer I hoped it would be. Not only did Samsung fail to expand the Flex Window's utility, it actually removed Galaxy Z Flip 6 features.</p><p>Using the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen was a game of seeing how far I could get before reaching the inevitable <strong>Open phone to continue</strong> message. Eventually, it feels like you'll always reach that dead end. In some cases, you'll reach it quicker on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 than the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Competitors like the Motorola Razr offer a fully-featured cover screen, making the Galaxy Z Flip 7's regressions even more glaring.</p><h2 id="flex-window-widgets-are-a-shell-of-their-former-selves-2">Flex Window widgets are a shell of their former selves</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GgxthA7tdSXeF7TbSuZhyF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-8" alt="The weather widget on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GgxthA7tdSXeF7TbSuZhyF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung caught a lot of flak for its implementation of the cover screen, called the Flex Window, on Galaxy Z Flip modes. I was actually somewhat fond of it, thinking that the small outer display was better suited to widgets, notification management, and camera use rather than running full-blown apps.</p><p>The company increased the size of the Flex Window between the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 from 3.4 inches to 4.1 inches, leading many to assume we were getting an unrestricted cover screen for the first time. Instead, we get something somewhere in the middle. The new model isn't as good at running basic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> widgets anymore, but it also can't run regular Android apps or add any third-party widget.</p><p>Here's what I mean. On the Galaxy Z Flip 6 updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, the folder-style cover screen can run <em>either</em> full-screen widgets or widget panels with smaller, individual items. You have customization options that let you see a full-size weather widget spanning the entire cover screen, or a smaller one that coexists with other widgets. Personally, I think full-screen Flex Window widgets — like Weather, Phone, and Samsung Health panels — provide a ton of information while looking great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iqfrPR7kwxRTUvpD3PpHqS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqfrPR7kwxRTUvpD3PpHqS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung completely axed this feature from the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and I can't understand why. There are no 4x4 app widgets available on the larger cover screen that I've found even though they are functionally possible, and worked on older models. The only exceptions are the Apps and MultiStar modules, which are 4x4 on the grid, but are more akin to a home screen launcher than an actual widget.</p><p>Instead of scrolling through Flex Window screens to information-dense widget panels on the Galaxy Z Flip 7, you now have to find a smaller widget and tap it to open up the full visual breakdown. It results in an experience that is less intuitive and requires more taps compared to the old one on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. If you like putting one type of widget on each Flex Window screen, your display will look empty due to the half-height widgets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmaiLiQrBYJBagUFfNJyAG" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-3" alt="The Tesla app running on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmaiLiQrBYJBagUFfNJyAG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no good reason for removing features that should work generation-to-generation, but I could've excused it if Samsung gave me something in return — like being able to put any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> widget on the cover screen.</p><p>While some have speculated the new UI and bigger Flex Window made this possible, I can confirm it still isn't. A few third-party widgets are available, like Spotify and TikTok, but I don't use Spotify and I have no idea why you'd want TikTok on your cover screen.</p><p>Instead, I would've loved to use the Tesla widget on the Galaxy Z Flip 7's cover screen to unlock my car or start the AC without opening my phone. Alas, I can't do that.

It also supports far more cover screen widgets natively than the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7, including Discogs and NJ Transit, pictured above.</p><p>These are problems that foldable phones have already solved, and I'm shocked that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 removed Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen features without adding anything else.</p><h2 id="you-can-do-fewer-things-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-2">You can do fewer things on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3FvSxBk6eyJpHfLMC734aS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-5" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FvSxBk6eyJpHfLMC734aS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's arbitrary cover screen limits on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will force you to run into "dead ends" sooner, which is frustrating. You can't manage widget panels on the cover screen at all in One UI 8 on the new model; every action requires opening the main display. Simply trying to move the location of a widget or adding a new one will prompt you to flip the phone open.</p><p>As you can see in the photo above, you can easily add and manage widgets on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen. Again, I find myself at a loss trying to understand why Samsung would change this behavior.

Van Pelt states the latest update was a "collaborative effort" between global stakeholders to introduce an upgrade to users' "audio messaging capabilities." To achieve this, the post states v3.1 includes support for the xHE-AAC audio codec.</p><p>For the end-user, this update will make all of your voice messages sent and received sound clearer and crisper. GSMA states it delivers a more "natural playback" that likely comes without any artifacts while you're speaking into your phone for the voice message. On a more technical level, this newly supported codec upgrades RCS voice messages with "highly efficient" compression and decompression of the audio file.</p><p>GSMA adds that this will improve the quality of "speech and non-speech use cases." So, whether you're recording your voice or recording some music to get your friends to the cafe, it'll sound better.</p><p>This v3.1 update is bringing in "new mechanisms for connecting RCS clients to operator services." In short, this update looks to make the reliability of the RCS experience seamless and more in line with what users would expect. GSMA also states that RCS services should be more reliable in "challenging" coverage zones.</p><h2 id="rcs-continues-to-improve-2">RCS continues to improve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj" name="Google-Messages-iMessage-green-bubble.jpg" alt="Google Messages on an Android phone and iMessage on an iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GB5TtmLRcpbMih8aXYemjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The GSMA's Van Pelt mentions the advancements v3.1 makes, which are said to build upon what began during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/apple-gsma-rcs-encryption-standrd-update-confirmed">its v3.0 update in March</a>. The major talking point in that update was the (long-awaited) inclusion of E2EE (end-to-end encryption) for the RCS standard. Van Pelt stated at the time that v3.0 brings "the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers."</p><p>This was during the time Apple finally incorporated the RCS standard on iPhones with Android devices. However, Apple's integration notably lacked encryption capabilities. Adding such capabilities rolled out in an update after the RCS v3.0 update's arrival. While this sounds strange, RCS, as a whole, never supported encryption to begin with. It was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">Google that decided to bring such protection</a> to users originally.</p><p>As of v3.0, everyone can get those helpful (and welcome) protections.</p><p>The Association teases that its v3.1 update is the start of its focus on "media quality, service flexibility, and global scalability."</p> ]]></dc:content>

This camera hardware should never take photos this well.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Wr4zttXfrQnJQk5Gn9jRH" name="Galaxy-S25-Edge-Camera-Telephoto" alt="An iPhone 16 Pro with a telephoto lens beside a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge without one." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Wr4zttXfrQnJQk5Gn9jRH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless you take photos for a living or as a serious hobby, chances are the camera on your phone is the best one you have. It didn't always used to be that way.</p><p>About 10 years ago, I tested a $12 Barbie-themed disposable camera against a few expensive smartphones, and that cheap camera that was designed to be thrown away once you've used it did a much better job. We've come a long way.</p><p>It still seems like magic, though. The camera on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">even the best phones</a> has terrible hardware when compared to most any other camera. It lacks any focal depth, is built of plastic and not glass, and the sensor itself is just so tiny. You would expect the photos that come out of it to be terrible. But they aren't.</p><p>There are two reasons for it — one technical and one practical. I'm not going to dive really deep into the technical side, but here's a quick overview of how it all works.</p><h2 id="the-electronic-shutter-chain-2">The electronic shutter chain</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.13%;"><img id="MbKEzCpADHXmMv4FuqgAJa" name="shutter-speed.jpg" alt="Shutter speed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MbKEzCpADHXmMv4FuqgAJa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="601" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Your phone camera is a lot like a camcorder or a webcam because a series of events happens that we call an electronic shutter. You might have seen people take a roll of film and use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.peachjar.com/pinhole-photography?hs_amp=true" target="_blank">a tiny hole in cardboard to take a photo</a>, but digital cameras — including the one on our phones — are a different beast.</p><p>Your camera's sensor is an array of light-sensitive electronic devices called photodiodes. The amount and intensity of light that hits each one decides the amount of bias current applied to each individual one.</p><p>That flow of electrons is sent to what's called a charge well, which is basically a storage capacitor, and you have one for every pixel (1 MP = one million pixels). As long as the bias current is present (meaning the camera is actively gathering light) the charge is collected until the charge well fills.</p><p>When it's time to turn this electricity into something else, the diode is turned off and the charge is converted into a specific voltage, then run through a filter and amplifier to "clean" up the signal, and into an analog to digital converter. This produces a 10-bit (or 12-bit or even 14-bit, depending on the sensor) number for each and every pixel. You can often choose the amount of time this shutter gathers data in your camera settings if you like to tinker.</p><p>All of this is called an electronic shutter. When you activate it, the charge wells fill with data, converted to a voltage, then a number, and can be read. This is a never-ending loop or stream of data that keeps happening until it's told to stop. It's the electronic equivalent of pushing the button on a "real" camera.</p><p>That data gets sent to specialized chips and software from companies like Google, Apple, or Qualcomm read and adjust those numbers to try and make a perfect arrangement of all the pixels of color. The software is a lot more important than the hardware because a stream of light information is constantly changing; capturing it perfectly doesn't matter as much as what you turn it into.</p><p>Of course, there are a lot of other details and methods, but this is the basic explanation of how a device with a sensor that's "always on" turns what's in front of it into a photograph.</p><h2 id="the-practical-side-2">The practical side</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfqijoTHMDheu3SZYLbNnc" name="Google-Photos-magic-editor.jpg" alt="Google Photos magic eraser tool being shown on the stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfqijoTHMDheu3SZYLbNnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Electronics aside, the important reason why we love the pics our phones take is more practical: <strong>The source is matched to the destination.</strong></p><p>That sounds like some sort of weird ancient philosopher gibberish, but it's true. A smartphone camera is designed to take photos that look really good when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">viewed on a screen</a>, like the one on your phone. Since most photos are shared from one phone to another, or from a phone to a laptop or something else with a display, the photos look great. If you take your favorite photo to Walmart and have it printed out as a poster, you're going to <strong>hate</strong> it.</p><p>If you compare a smartphone camera photo with a photo taken from a camera with glass lenses, an adjustable aperture, and a larger sensor, you'll find they only look good when they're very small and the individual pixels are densely packed together. This is by design — the algorithms that turn the electrical noise into a photo I described above were tuned to do just this — make it look as good as it can on a small display.</p><p>Size matters here. A 16MP sensor on a phone is one-fortieth the size of a 16MP sensor on a DSLR camera, so there is <strong>40 times more light data</strong> to work with on the professional camera. This is clearly evident on an unedited capture, but you'll never see one even if you take photos in your phone's RAW output mode. Software governs every step, and you don't get to control most of it.</p><h2 id="what-matters-is-what-we-see-2">What matters is what we see</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-in-hand-back" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKvpUK4u6UDDboAQjPHjkf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5326" height="2996" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's really important is that you like the photos you can take with your phone, not how they are created. Phone makers have done a lot to improve the camera because it's a feature almost everyone loves and uses. They've done a good job.</p><p>When you take a picture of your kids or pets and send it off to your best friend, you can be pretty sure they'll appreciate it because it looks great instead of considering all the science and technology that went into making it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be revealed at this event, which starts at 10 a.m. PT and will be livestreamed across official Google channels.</p><p>Rumors point to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold being offered in two colorways: Jade and Moonstone. The first is an eye-catching finish with green and gold hues, while the latter is a more traditional silver-blue.</p><p>As for pricing and availability, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to start with 256GB of storage and could be priced at $1,799. Some earlier reports suggested that Google might slash prices this year, but those have simmered down recently. You'll be able to configure the phone with up to 1TB of storage.</p><p>The original Google Pixel Fold was released in June 2023 for $1,799. It's still available through Google's retail partners, most recently dropping to $650 on Amazon for the base storage configuration. Even the upgraded 512GB model is only $100 more, making the Pixel Fold one of the cheapest large foldable phones you can get in new condition.

Google initially broke the mold by making the Pixel Fold with a wide aspect ratio. It offers an expansive cover display that is both wider and shorter than a typical smartphone. When opened, the Pixel Fold featured a book-style display that was more rectangular than square.</p><p>Starting with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold released last year, Google shifted its foldable aspect ratios to be more like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. The phone wasn't nearly as wide or short, and the aspect ratio felt more like a slab smartphone. When opened, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is more square than the Pixel Fold, and it doesn't look much like a book anymore.</p><p>You can look at the aspect ratio differences between all these foldable phones in the photo below, with the Pixel Fold and Pixel 9 Pro Fold in the middle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Lmh82ebQZh4rtj2Qx2MARc" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-oneplus-open-cover-screens.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel Fold, OnePlus Open and Galaxy Z Fold 6 showing cover screens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lmh82ebQZh4rtj2Qx2MARc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">From left to right: OnePlus Open, Google Pixel Fold, Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This should give you a decent idea of how the Pixel Fold will compare to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, because Google isn't expected to make many design changes this year. The cover display is rumored to get a tad bit larger, growing to 6.4 inches. It's believed that Google will slim down the bezel and hinge assembly to the left of the cover screen to fit the bigger screen. On the inside, there will be an 8-inch OLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate support.</p><p>This is larger than the Pixel Fold, which packed a 7.6-inch OLED panel on the inside with 120Hz support and only 1,450 nits of peak brightness. The cover screen is smaller too, at 5.8 inches. The real differences lie in the aspect ratios, however. The Pixel Fold's main screen has a 17.4:9 aspect ratio, whereas the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should have a 1:1 square aspect ratio.</p><p>It's impossible to know which form factor is best without considering your individual needs. If you like to read on your foldable, you might actually prefer the book or e-reader vibe of the Pixel Fold. Want to multitask and run full-size apps side-by-side? The Pixel 10 Pro Fold's main screen will feel like two Pixels smashed together. It all depends on what you're looking for.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-display-unfolded-reading-google-books.jpg" alt="Reading a book on the Google Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3fnzv3Xc9w6C7E7fKgW3qN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Fold has lackluster build quality, and it all boils down to the lack of dust resistance. The phone is only IPX8-certified for water-resistance. This causes a problem because dust can quickly creep into the hinge assembly, preventing the Pixel Fold from opening completely flat. It could also make the Pixel Fold more susceptible to screen damage.</p><p>By comparison, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to be the first foldable to be IP68-certified — the highest level of dust-resistance available. It would be a major breakthrough for Google. Paired with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the outside, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be an insanely durable phone.</p><p>The Pixel Fold is a behemoth, measuring 12.1mm thick when folded and weighing 283 grams. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be thinner and lighter at 10.8mm thick and weighing 258 grams, but it's worth noting that's actually a slight regression <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">compared to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel Fold: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The performance disparity between the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro Fold and the original Pixel Fold will be <em>massive</em>. The first-generation Google foldable is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Tensor G2 platform</a> — a system-on-a-chip riddled with issues. Slow speeds and overheating problems were just a few problems that affected the Tensor G2 processor and by extension, the Pixel Fold. Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be powered by the Tensor G5, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">should be the best Tensor chip upgrade ever</a>.</p><p>Google is reportedly making the switch from Samsung Foundry to TSMC for this Tensor G5 chipset, and using the latter's 3nm process. This advanced fabrication process puts Tensor closer in line with Qualcomm and Apple processors. It will almost certainly result in faster speeds and more power. Plus, Google is said to be using more custom chip components in the Tensor G5, which should help with efficiency and optimization.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch OLED, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152 resolution, 373 ppi, 2700 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>7.6-inch 120Hz OLED (1-120Hz), 6:5 aspect ratio, 2208 x 1840 (380 PPI), HDR, 1,450 nits peak brightness, Ultra Thin Glass with plastic protective layer</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch OLED, 3,000 nits peak brightness</p></td><td  ><p>5.8-inch 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 17.4:9 aspect ratio, 2092 x 1080, 1,550 nits peak brightness, Gorilla Glass Victus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 13 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB UFS 3.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,821mAh (dual 2,410mAh batteries)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2)</p></td><td  ><p>21W fast charging, 7.5W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.5MP ultrawide + 10.8MP telephoto (5x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP ultrawide + 10.8MP telephoto (5x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>9.5MP (cover display) + 8MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>Folded (155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8mm); Unfolded (155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2mm)</p></td><td  ><p>79.5 x 139.7 x 12.1mm (folded); 158.7 x 139.7 x 5.8mm (unfolded)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>258g</p></td><td  ><p>283g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IPX8</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As such, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold should improve upon the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and both will blow the Pixel Fold out of the water.

Best paired with a Samsung Galaxy smartphone to unlock exclusive features, the Galaxy Watch 8 came out of the gate with Wear OS 6 and One UI 8 Watch, which was made available as an update in late July.</p><p>With One UI 8, you get upgrades like motivational health features, a more intuitive interface, and access to powerful new tools like Running Coach, Vascular Load, and Antioxidant Index.</p><p>You can see Multi-Info Tiles on the screen, providing details about everything from your health metrics to weather. The Now Bar makes it easy to see and access details from supported apps.</p><p>It won’t end there, though. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 will support four years of software updates. This means it will be updatable through 2029, and thus current for many years to come. The same, it should be noted, applies to the larger Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. This is also the promise Samsung has committed to for all its latest-generation smartwatches.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean you have to hang onto it for four years. While this watch will continue to run the same OS as any new models launching in the next 48 months, there could be a new watch down the line that has exclusive features or a refined design that catches your eye. What do you do then?</p><p>The good news is that the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 will retain good trade-in value if you want to upgrade, provided it's kept in good condition. You could also resell or hand it down to a friend or family member once you’re ready for something new. They’ll have the reassurance that even if this happens two years from now, the watch still has a couple of years left of software support to remain current and up to date with the latest features.</p><p>But with all the goodies in this sleek smartwatch, which will likely soon rank among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">the best Samsung Galaxy smartwatches</a>, you might be more than happy to hang onto it through to the end of the 2020s.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d3ec1869-e255-4699-9ac5-2069455a1e1d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Keep it to the end of the decade</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is supported through 2029, so it will last well into the end of this decade.

By now, we know (or <em>think</em> we know) everything about the Google Pixel 10. In fact, Google itself has even leaked the Pixel 10 lineup and teased its existence on multiple occasions. That leaves one key question — if you have a Google Pixel 8, should you replace it with a Pixel 10?</p><p>Most people try to keep their phones for around three years, lining up with common carrier contracts and installment plans. Considering how expensive they are, it's tough to justify swapping out phones annually. However, after two years, your phone starts to feel stale. It's worth looking at whether the Pixel 10 offers enough value over your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, especially if there are good trade-in deals.</p><p>Here's what we know about how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> will improve upon the Pixel 8 ahead of its official launch.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-8-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 8: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d6svgW4tFV6uSmUeBU32Xe" name="Made-by-Google-2025-dummy-poster" alt="Made by Google 2025: How to watch and what to expect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d6svgW4tFV6uSmUeBU32Xe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">announced a Made by Google event for Aug. 20</a>, and that's where we'll see the Pixel 10 debut alongside a few other products.

It's said to be available in four colors, and three new ones: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Limoncello.</p><p>The Pixel 10 might start at a 128GB storage configuration, and keep its $799 retail price. Higher storage configurations will be available at a higher cost. It's always possible that Google does decide to hike the Pixel 10 price, too — we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>Meanwhile, sales for the Google Pixel 8 began Oct. 12, 2023. The smartphone started at $699, and it's still available for purchase directly from the Google Store. Availability could become more limited when the Pixel 10 officially releases, as the Pixel 8 could be discontinued. The base model has 128GB of storage and is available in Hazel, Obsidian, Mint, and Rose.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-8-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 vs. Pixel 8: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is keeping a similar design language to the Pixel 9 on the Pixel 10, but both are a sharp departure from the Pixel 8.

It's a stark contrast from what we expect to see on the Google Pixel 10 — a mostly-rectangular chassis with slightly chamfered edges and a flat design.</p><p>Depending on your preference, you might like one over another. The Pixel 8 has the classic, and now vintage, Pixel camera bar. Google switched to the oval-shaped camera housing with the Pixel 9, and that's still here on the Pixel 10, according to leaked renders. The camera housing will protrude further from the back of the Pixel 10 than the Pixel 8, and you'll get three cameras on the back compared to two.</p><p>Rumors point to the Pixel 10 being offered in Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Limoncello colorways, which are pictured below as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-leak-flaunts-way-more-daring-colors-this-time-around">leaked renders</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in white" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr5GGJzgqocEtmebXDNigf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in lime (Limoncello)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7xeHCg3c3SGZJ2zftFgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in black (Obsidian)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6JibYHoD56dz4hyidKGgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf" name="Google-Pixel-10-renders" alt="Pixel 10 render in blue (Indigo)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UnEtaAkKsbfegxkP4gshgf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google offered the Pixel 8 in Hazel, Rose, and Obsidian colorways at launch, and later added a Mint color.</p><p>While the older Pixel 8 is thought to be thicker, it is also rumored to be lighter than the upcoming Pixel 10.

This is a noticeable change from previous generation Folds: not since the original has Samsung decided to go without S Pen support. The main reason is to eliminate bulk for the svelte device, allowing it to be ultra-thin, pocketable, and seamless in its design.</p></article></section><h2 id="navigation-and-input-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-does-not-include-s-pen-2">Navigation and input on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 does not include S Pen</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="auwZq9DyyYafa2RGaQRKU5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-1" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/auwZq9DyyYafa2RGaQRKU5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is the brand’s latest entry into the foldable phone space. It boasts several improvements over the previous generation Galaxy Z Fold 6, but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">does not retain S Pen support</a>. This, however, is for good reason.</p><p>The foldable phone includes a 6.5-inch outer screen and a larger 8-inch inner screen once unfolded. You can navigate, input, and communicate with it in numerous ways, including swipes, taps, and of course, voice.</p><p>The main reason was to ensure the phone’s screen could remain ultra-thin, which means not including an active layer to support S Pen input. Instead, the screen is thinner, stronger, and has a less noticeable crease.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 measures 8.99mm when folded, about 4.2mm unfolded, which is a marvel in its own right. When it’s folded up, it’s only slightly thicker than a traditional bar-shaped phone. When unfolded, it’s super slim and sleek. Adding S Pen support would have required adjusting the design in a significant way that may not have been a worthwhile trade-off.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dbwquNz8SJDQmmqjMMQ22R" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 on corner of path" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbwquNz8SJDQmmqjMMQ22R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that building the phone to integrate an S Pen would be off the table as well. This design includes a slot where the stylus can slide in and out for seamless use. To accommodate that, the phone itself would have to be made thicker. Samsung didn’t include an S Pen or an S Pen slot with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> either. However, that phone is indeed compatible with one thanks to the addition of an active layer on the screen.</p><p>A Samsung executive confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/why-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-doesnt-come-with-an-s-pen/" target="_blank">CNET</a> that Samsung didn’t want to compromise on battery life, performance, or the slim design to be able to add an S Pen to the equation.</p><p>Consider that while the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a fantastic phone for productivity, you are more likely to connect it to a larger desktop through Samsung DeX for such tasks anyway. It’s with entertainment features that this phone excels, including watching videos, surfing the web, multitasking, and capturing content.</p><p>With that said, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250714000288" target="_blank">ETNews</a>, Samsung may be working on how to develop a thinner S Pen that would better integrate with future versions of foldables. So, it’s not completely out of the realm of possibility to see one in a next-gen device.</p><p>For now, when it comes to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which is on track to replace the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">the best foldable phones</a>, you’ll have to use your finger or leverage all the cool voice control capabilities through Google Gemini for navigation, sketching, and control. It’s an unfortunate trade-off, but given the either-or scenario, most users would probably take the thinner design, better performance, improved battery, and larger unobstructed screen experience over having an S Pen.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ab84af6d-4668-40ff-98da-32676e7d9480">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Sacrifices for design</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 sacrificed the inclusion of S Pen support in favor of a sleeker, slimmer design for both the screen and the phone overall, as well as enhanced performance and battery life.

Trained on data from thousands of people, the system deciphers minute electrical patterns that the brain sends to your fingers.</p><p>One test user typed at over 20 words per minute just thinking the stroke motions. The team smashed the key hurdles: generalization across users (so it doesn’t need per‑person calibration), consistent gesture recognition, and handwriting decoding, all embedded in a wristband-style interface.</p><p>The big deal here is speed and subtlety.

In its Nature paper, Meta showed off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion</a>, a prototype wristband that predicted gestures with scary accuracy, even when people barely moved.

It also makes using tech feel more natural and less effortful.</p><p>That said, it’s still early days. Orion glasses reportedly cost around $10,000 per unit and aren’t available to the public yet. The wristband, while extremely promising, is still in prototype phase with no clear timeline for a commercial launch.</p><p>But Meta says it's working toward more affordable, consumer-ready versions of both, and the progress so far suggests it's serious.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We have been actively working on major improvements for sometime and will have more to share in the fall.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1948164063357481263">July 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>On top of that, Google is currently undergoing a major transition from classic Assistant to Gemini — an AI-powered voice assistant. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">Google Assistant has already lost more than 20 features since 2024</a> as part of the move. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">No product category is hurt more by these deprecations than Home and Nest</a>, which can't leverage Gemini yet. Meanwhile, Android phones and tablets, Wear OS watches, and ChromeOS devices can all use Gemini over Assistant.</p><p>A new post complaining about Home and Nest troubles seemingly pops up on social media every few days, with this one on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1m5ygut/the_enshittification_of_google_home/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=action_bar&embed_host_url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/google-promises-a-smart-home-fix-apologizes-for-assistant-troubles" target="_blank">Reddit</a> garnering nearly 300 comments in three days. Another on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@michaelbtech/post/DMac7pFRkeY?xmt=AQF0E56IZfkY_tvjZplGibp4RCl1Kq-RfI_eYpLDrgYxcA" target="_blank">Threads</a> from two days ago gained traction as well, and that's just the start.</p><p>This is presumably why Google's head of Home and Nest is publicly addressing the customer concerns now. Unfortunately, they'll have to wait until Fall 2025 to get a proper fix — which may include Gemini support for smart speakers and displays, according to rumors.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that while "poking around the Google Play Store app," likely through its APK/code, the tipster was able to surface a snapshot of the Pixel 10 series in full.</p><p>The photo shows the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> model leading off from the right in a rumored "indigo," followed by the Pixel 10 Pro, the 10 Pro Fold, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL. From this imagery, it <em>seemingly </em>doubles down on previous rumors about the vanilla Pixel 10 model picking up a third lens.</p><p>However, the "Meet the new Pixel 10 series" leaked advertisement on the Play Store supposedly suggests another aspect: the inclusion of a $50 off deal on a device in the series. There's nothing more concrete beyond that, considering this was leveraged from within the app itself—and the series isn't out yet. This will likely appear sometime after the series' debut in August, as the publication also speculates.</p><p>Whatever this promotion entails is seemingly prepared to run until October 13. It's just the start date we're left wondering about.</p><h2 id="here-comes-10-2">Here comes 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Recently, rumors have been swirling about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">the Pixel 10 series' colors</a>. Supposedly, the base model is arriving in Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Lemongrass. The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are said to feature Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade. Rumors conclude with Moonstone and Jade for the 10 Pro Fold. Moreover, some of these color leaks came with noteworthy specification theories.</p><p>Some reports claim the highest storage option available for the Pro and Pro XL will be 1TB; however, this seems restricted to its Obsidian variant.

Meta states the experience Quest users will find through their VR headsets mirrors what you'd find on your phone or computer. After signing in (or signing up), users will find their saved selection of favorite tracks and playlists via their Meta Quest headset.</p><p>Users can also create entirely new playlists through their headset, alongside music controls. Meta states users can easily switch songs and adjust their volume "without interrupting the fun."</p><p>Aside from music, Meta states its Quest headsets support Spotify's podcasts, meaning you can "listen or watch" directly from the app in VR. Another major highlight is Spotify's Quest integration lets users have their tunes playing in the background while in other apps. It's giving classic Xbox 360 and (newer-gen) PlayStation vibes. As an example, Meta states your songs in Spotify will continue playing while you're "gaming, working out, or making a virtual painting" with your Quest.</p><p>If you're unsure where to begin, Meta suggests checking out Spotify's Discover Weekly, Songs of Summer, or Summer Throwbacks playlists. Android Central has spotted the Spotify app on the Meta Quest's app store as of early this afternoon with a small 2.31MB download size.</p><h2 id="do-more-and-jam-while-you-do-2">Do More, and jam while you do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ" name="meta-quest-3-horizon-os-ui-jan-2025-multiple-windows" alt="Using a Meta Quest 3 with six windows open at once" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGNbwNJGradDJoCZnjSyPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you missed it, Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-discover-weekly-turns-10-birthday-update-bash">Discover Weekly recently turned 10</a>. To celebrate, the platform gifted its users with two updates: a revamped playlist design and the ability to "guide" Discover Weekly to the tunes and vibes you'd rather hear.</p><p>One of the things Meta mentioned during the Spotify app's integration is "Multiple screens + ambient audio = bliss." The company has continued to refine its Quest Horizon UI, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-ui-overhaul-tease">the company's CTO discussed last year</a>. Andrew Bosworth, Meta CTO, mentioned the company's interest last year behind "reworking the core UI infrastructure in order to enable a richer environment."</p><p>A major part of this rework was giving the user the ability to move their windows to any spot while in mixed reality.</p><p>There was a feature that arrived last year, in the name of enrichment, called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-travel-mode-launch">Travel Mode</a>." Meta stated it wanted to position its headsets as the "ultimate in-flight entertainment device." Travel Mode is essentially a private space for users looking to game, watch their own content, or anything else while on a flight.

Fady Mishriki, chair of the WPC’s Board of Directors, stated, "Consumers will be delighted when they experience Qi2 25W as it delivers nearly 70% more power than the original Qi2. The number of devices in the Qi2 25W certification queue for launch is unprecedented, as is the quality and breadth of our members’ product designs."</p><p>Piggybacking off Mishriki's statement, the WPC reports that its Qi2 25W wireless charging version solves a problem many smartphone OEMs struggled with: fast-charging protocols. It also solves a major critique consumers have reported to the WPC, which regards faster wireless charging, as we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-does-not-require-magnets">previously limited to 15W</a>.</p><p>Now, two years later, the WPC says it has launched a new protocol/version that can "enable truly high-speed Qi-certified wireless charging" for phone makers and consumers.</p><p>While iPhones are involved in this, the WPC announces that "major Android smartphones" will also join Qi2 officially. The post states "14 devices, receivers, and transmitters" have already received certification for Qi2 25W. However, there's more to come, as the WPC states "full-scale" certification has opened for an even larger influx of devices awaiting Qi2 25W certification.</p><h2 id="qi2-is-headed-for-more-android-phones-2">Qi2 is headed for more Android phones</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-case-options-1" alt="Various cases for the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LUUSXE6pJeM2nCySXZaz83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The WPC's announcement didn't tease when consumers could see new devices launching with Qi2 25W, as that's likely up to the manufacturers. We're stepping into the second half of the year, so there's a chance we'll begin noticing these devices pop up more and more, and even more considerably in 2026.</p><p>Android users have been waiting on this since January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">when the WPC stated</a> consumers would see an "acceleration in Android devices with Qi2 built in during 2025." During this time, Samsung and Google truly buckled down and got aboard the Qi2 wireless charging train with the WPC. Per Samsung, "You can expect to see Android devices supporting Qi2 from Samsung Galaxy devices in 2025."</p><p>We've already seen that with the likes of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which supports Qi2 at 15W (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">though it lacks the magnets internally</a>).</p><p>The other side of this is Google, which has become "committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard." The company also solidified itself as a notable assistant to the WPC in developing its Qi2 v2.2 standard that we're seeing announced currently.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Rumors and leaks currently point to the Google Pixel 10 lineup fully supporting Qi2 and MagSafe with inbuilt magnets, complemented by a new "Pixelsnap"  line of accessories.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-qi2-support-on-the-google-pixel-10-2">Everything you need to know about Qi2 support on the Google Pixel 10</h2><p>The Qi2 wireless charging standard is available with or without the Magnetic Power Profile (MPP). Phones with the MPP have built-in magnets that connect with Qi2 or MagSafe chargers and accessories. Those without magnets inside can only support Qi2 Ready, which requires a magnetic case to unlock full magnetic alignment. For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">the Samsung Galaxy S25 series supports Qi2 Ready</a>, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> includes magnets for the complete experience.</p><p>Google could take either route with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>. It elected not to include magnets inside the Pixel 9 series, which was announced in August 2024. Then, in January 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Google said</a> it is "committed to the Qi2 wireless charging standard and increasing the penetration of Qi2 into Android handsets and other devices." It played a role in the development of the Qi2.2.1 specification, released July 23, 2025, which adds 25W wireless charging support.</p><p>The Wireless Power Consortium is responsible for managing the Qi wireless charging standard, and it said "major Android smartphones" will support Qi2 25W — also known as Qi2.2.1.</p><p>Being that Google is set to release the Pixel 10 lineup in August and helped create Qi2 25W, there is a strong reason to believe its upcoming phones will feature built-in magnets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BntYCSHrjCWfDA6jN3mXc4" name="thinborne-pixel-10-cases-google-pixel-9-pro-xl-02" alt="Thinborne's early release cases for the Google Pixel 10 family" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BntYCSHrjCWfDA6jN3mXc4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An early release Google Pixel 10 Pro XL case with a Qi2 magnet array inside.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Adding to the likelihood of a Pixel 10 lineup with magnets inside is the rumors of Google selling first-party magnetic accessories. Google is said to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">readying a "Pixelsnap" lineup of Qi2 accessories</a> for the Pixel 10 launch, and that's as good of a sign as any that it plans to fully support magnetic Qi2.</p><p>On top of that, every Google Pixel 10 model is rumored to be heavier than its Pixel 9 counterpart. Only one model — the Pixel 10 Pro XL — will match the thickness of the phone it is replacing; the rest are getting heavier. A thicker and heavier Pixel 10 lineup is perplexing, but the addition of magnets inside could help explain the discrepancy.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">what Google announces at the Made by Google event</a> set for Aug. 20 to be sure. For now, signs are pointing to the Pixel 10 series being the first to include built-in magnetic charging support.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="878fd9be-df7f-4dc9-8f6b-b71b598d4857">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yp5tTetz8vxwvnmVisSQuj.jpg' alt="UGREEN Uno Charger 65W charger "></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ugreen Uno 65 charger</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The perfect Pixel 10 accessory</strong></em></p><p>Looking to upgrade your charging setup before upgrading to the Google Pixel 10?

Until then, rumors and leaks give us a hint about how fast we can expect the Google Pixel 10 lineup to charge. Keep in mind that until they're made official, these figures could change or turn out to be incorrect.</p><p>The base-model Pixel 10 will charge at 29W with a cable, according to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-specs" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report. That's up slightly from the 27W rate supported by the Google Pixel 9. The faster charging speed reportedly coincides with more battery capacity. The upcoming model is said to ship with a 4,970mAh battery, which is an increase of 270mAh compared to the current one.</p><p>These same charging speeds are supported by the Google Pixel 10 Pro. The larger and most expensive handset, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, will get the fastest charging speeds. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to charge at up to 39W with a cable.

There haven't been a ton of leaks for the 10 Pro Fold, but what we know about it so far, it should bring some key upgrades to the processor, battery size, and cameras. If you didn't buy the 9 Pro Fold in 2024, does it make sense to wait for the 10 Pro Fold before you decide?</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> was a solid phone, and it still is, but it also lacked some key features that made it a bit too expensive to consider. The lukewarm processor performance, underwhelming cameras, and the fact that it only has an IPX8 rating means it's not exactly dustproof. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to address all these shortcomings, and a few more. Let's see what we know about the Pixel 10 Pro Fold so far and which one is a better choice.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Half-Opened.jpeg" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold half-opened." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWpcKsPZyBw6FCupAZdd2f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unlike the many rumors and leaked renders of the Pixel 10 series, we don't have much physical proof that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold exists, but one can make an educated guess that it's in the works. We're not expecting any major redesigns here as it should look largely the same as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. We do hope that Google makes it slimmer and lighter, now that Samsung has finally caved and got with the program. The outer display on the 10 Pro Fold is expected to be slightly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-specs">larger at 6.4 inches</a>, which means it could be a bit wider or taller, depending on how Google plays with the aspect ratio.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold weighed a hefty 257 grams and was 10.5mm thick when folded. The design and ergonomics were very good, but there's no escaping that weight. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to have a new hinge design, which would also make the crease on the folding display less prominent. We're hoping these changes drop the weight of the phone to something closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="8kTUfssJKYiZ6JZLTWBch9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-06.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8kTUfssJKYiZ6JZLTWBch9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold had a 6.3-inch Full-HD+ outer OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and 2,700 nits of peak brightness. This brightness level is expected to be higher on the new Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The folding display will mostly stay the same as the one on the 9 Pro Fold, which is an 8-inch LTPO OLED with the same brightness level as the outer screen.</p><p>Some notable improvements to the display which we can expect the 10 Pro Fold to have would be narrower bezels, higher brightness, a more power-efficient OLED panel, and sturdier ultrathin glass (UTG) for better scratch protection. To be honest, we didn't face any real legibility issues when using the Pixel 9 Pro Fold's displays in our review, so we're sure the 10 Pro Fold will have the same, if not better, displays.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2Vuy6HhXHjqdUKgF9mHyc8" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-studio-download-model.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold showing Pixel Studio Downloading Model prompt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Vuy6HhXHjqdUKgF9mHyc8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pricing for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is another aspect where we don't have any real information on, yet. Since the rest of the Pixel 10 series is not expected to get any bump in price, let's assume for a moment that the 10 Pro Fold will also start at $1,799 for the 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. We're also expecting a third storage tier this time of 1TB, which will push the pricing well beyond $2,000. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold came in just two colors and we're expecting something similar for the 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>The big change we're all excited for is the shift to the new Tensor G5 SoC. The entire Pixel 10 series will be using it, and it should finally be able to match up (or get closer to) Qualcomm's Elite chip. The G5 will be using a smaller 3nm process node and will be made by TSMC rather than Samsung. This should finally put to rest the overheating and poor raw performance that have been plaguing Pixels for years.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 2700 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Super Actua Flex display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (1-120Hz), 2076 x 2152, HDR, 2700 nits, Ultra Thin Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Outer display</p></td><td  ><p>6.4-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 2700 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Actua display, 120Hz OLED (60-120Hz), 1080 x 2424, HDR, 2700 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB/1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/ 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 10.8MP telephoto + 10.5MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover + folding screen cameras</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td><td  ><p>10MP + 10MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IPX8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Side-mounted fingerprint scanner, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,015mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,650mAh, 21W wired charging, 7.5W Qi wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions (folded/ unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5mm / 155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is slated to get a big boost in battery capacity to 5,015mAh, making it the largest battery yet in a Pixel foldable. The budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> still beats it by a small margin though, thanks to its 5,100mAh battery. Hopefully, we see an increase in charging speeds too, especially for wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold had a 4,650mAh battery, and it delivered above-average battery life for a folding phone. With the power-efficiency enhancements to Tensor G5 and a larger battery, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could easily have the best battery life of any Pixel yet.</p><p>The cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold were disappointing since they were the same sensors lifted from the Pixel Fold, with the only tweaks being software-related. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might have similar resolution sensors, but Google is expected to overhaul the hardware and make it more competitive with the competition.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-split-screen-prompt-alt.jpg" alt="Split-screen prompt on Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FGpDTKpipC2U464JTXWyCb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, just like the rest of the 10 series.

The Pixel 9 Pro Fold launched with Android 14 and will be getting the same number of years of updates, but the 10 Pro Fold should outlast the 9 Pro Fold by two Android versions.</p><p>We don't know yet what exclusive AI features will be offered with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but rest assured that there will be many.

The Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses were a turning point for smart glasses as a product category, and depending on what Meta decides to release under the Ray-Ban name, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) could be the next revolution.</p><p>This year has brought a bevy of leaks for Meta's next-generation smart glasses. We've heard everything from Meta branching out to make separate styles for sunglasses and prescription glasses, to a third tier with a display in one of the lenses.</p><p>Whatever happens this year, we're expecting big things from Meta, as the company seems to shy away from the typical annual product release cycle and only releases hardware when something worthwhile is ready. Here's everything we know about Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) so far.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-price-and-availability"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From what we know so far, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) will ship in two main styles: Optical and Sunglasses. If this is the case, it would be an interesting new direction as Meta has always provided the same types of lenses for each style of glasses it launches. Even the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-and-metas-new-smart-glasses-are-built-for-athletes-and-they-look-insane">Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses</a> feature multiple styles with the same lens options.</p><p>There's no word on price differences for these two models just yet, but previous pairs of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have cost between $299-$349, depending on style and lenses chosen. Prescription lenses typically add extra cost.</p><p>Based on leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/this-could-be-our-first-look-at-the-next-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">from the XR Research Institute</a>, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) should arrive by the end of 2025. If so, we expect them to be unveiled at Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-design-and-features"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Design and features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AajrrkPS4dJA4EWfGjXaMJ" name="ray-ban-meta-3-optical-leak-16x9" alt="Leaked renders of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AajrrkPS4dJA4EWfGjXaMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We think Meta is breaking its third-generation Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses into two styles so that they can support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">a wider range of prescription lenses</a> than the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses offer. The current frames can't properly fit certain lenses, so having a separate design for optical versus sunglasses would solve this problem.</p><p>So far, we've seen two leaks pointing toward Meta launching dual designs for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) called "Aperol" and "Bellini." Both styles are reportedly going to receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-2026-smart-glasses-live-ai-facial-software-report">next-generation Meta AI assistant</a>, which will be able to run for hours at a time rather than the current 30-minute limit.</p><p>This is almost certainly designed to go head-to-head with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Android XR smart glasses</a>, which, as Google demonstrated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/smart-glasses-are-a-mess-but-android-xr-should-finally-fix-that">on stage at Google I/O 2025</a>, can record live for long periods and remember things for you. One of the most commonly cited uses is helping remember where you left your wallet or car keys by asking the AI assistant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to that, next-generation Meta AI on Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3) is said to be able to recognize faces. That can be useful in any place where you've met someone before but can't remember their name.</p><p>We're also expecting much better battery life based on these examples, plus the information found in leaks to date. Our Oakley Meta HSTN camera review showed that Meta has nearly doubled battery life compared to Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, despite using the same chipset.</p><p>If Meta can pack in the latest Qualcomm AR1+ Gen 1 chipset into Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3), it's entirely possible that battery life will eclipse Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses by quite a bit.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3-glasses-with-a-screen"><span>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3): Glasses with a screen?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For months now, we've seen leaks about an upcoming pair of Meta smart glasses that feature a screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">in one of the lenses</a>. While I used a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses for the mockup you see above, this new pair of display-equipped Meta smart glasses may look closer to the thicker frames of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> than existing Ray-Ban Smart Glasses.</p><p>These display-equipped glasses are currently known as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">Meta Hypernova</a>, but it's not clear if Meta will be using the Ray-Ban branding or another brand altogether. Meta currently owns 3% of EssilorLuxottica <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meta-takes-around-3-stake-ray-ban-parent-essilorluxottica-source-says-2025-07-08/">as of July 9, 2025</a>, so we expect both companies to continue to leverage the many different brands as a way to better market upcoming smart glasses.</p><p>Hypernova is said to feature a single display placed inside one lens and will ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">an sEMG bracelet</a> to make controlling the glasses effortless. This bracelet makes it possible to use smartphone-like gestures with your hands, but without the need to touch floating virtual objects as you might on a VR headset.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ynpJa4DMH4ycUFVW67DfTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-02" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ynpJa4DMH4ycUFVW67DfTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, the bracelet understands how the muscles in your wrist relate to your finger movements and can accurately translate that into clicks, pinches, and even typing based on how you're holding your hand. It also means you can easily look at an icon on the glasses' screen and pinch your fingers to open an app, even if your hands are resting in your lap.</p><p>The sEMG bracelet I used during my Meta Orion hands-on had haptic feedback, as well, so it felt like I was physically interacting with virtual objects, even though they weren't "real." You can see the bracelet on me in the photo above.</p><p>We don't know exactly when Hypernova will launch or what the price tag will be, but the rumor is that it could debut sometime late this year or early 2026 with a price tag well above the current Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of playing on the same screen or even on the same platform, one player uses a smartphone app while the other is fully immersed on a Meta Quest headset.</p><p>Despite the VR player doing "most" of the work, there are very few moments of downtime for the smartphone player. In VR, the game always begins in the desert just outside of the facility you're supposed to enter. The player on the smartphone begins by opening the van door for the VR player so they can fill up their "power glove," as I'll call it.</p><p>Aside from vaguely resembling the NES Power Glove accessory, the glove you wear in VR holds a small amount of liquid electricity that's used to power the puzzles you come across in the game. Once your glove is full, you'll turn around and head to the facility where the smartphone player will have to "hack" the elevator to send you underground.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v3LUNLwiXmbQA3SEVA2jqJ" name="elsewhere-electric-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot for Elsewhere Electric, showing a mysterious room with green lights" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3LUNLwiXmbQA3SEVA2jqJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Games by Stitch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most puzzles in the beginning of the game revolve around the two players decoding strange symbols to activate a station of some kind. The VR player sees each symbol at a station, and the smartphone player has a list of several pages of symbols to choose from. Since the smartphone player never sees exactly what the VR player sees, you'll need to work on your communication skills to accurately describe what you see.</p><p>Right off the bat, I noticed that most gamers I played this with were able to figure out how the game works in a matter of minutes. The smartphone UI is the hardest part to understand, as there's no explanation offered for what you're supposed to do. Poking around will reveal flashing icons that should be pressed from time to time, but this is never particularly obvious.</p><p>I played the game with my son and with a few other non-gamers, and all of them had the same frustrations. Without me specifically showing them what to click and where to go, they got annoyed enough to quit before helping me solve more than a few puzzles. Developer Games by Stitch has a nice walkthrough for the first few floors in the YouTube video below, but it's a long video that could have been shortened to a few prompts in an intro tutorial.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tf98e_av2jg" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>If you have the patience to get through the first three or four floors, you'll be greeted with one of the coolest co-op games I've <em>ever</em> played. The style of this game is wholly unique, in my experience, and while it feels familiar at times, it never feels like more than maybe an homage to something amazing.</p><p>The 1970s-esque technology and decor found throughout the facility, plus the groovy soundtrack, lend to the already strange and palpably thick atmosphere. This place feels eerie, yet somehow comforting, in a way the vacant halls of Severance do on a happy day in the office.</p><p>That is, of course, until you come across your first invisible enemy. No doubt, the smartphone player will notice something amiss first, as a strange creature lurking behind the glass on the first floor can't be spotted by the VR player. If the pieces don't connect by the second area of floor 2, your VR friend is in trouble.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qAXZDDwdV6KLVj6cvqV5sJ" name="elsewhere-electric-official-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot for Elsewhere Electric, showing a yellow room with shelves of tapes on them" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAXZDDwdV6KLVj6cvqV5sJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Games by Stitch)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In this way, Elsewhere Electric requires the patience of a game like Dark Souls, as you'll often die or fail an area only to have to come back and try it again. As with any puzzle room game, you'll get through the area faster in subsequent attempts. Thankfully, though, this isn't rogue-like and you'll never have to solve the same room twice once you progress beyond it. The elevator always takes you to the most recent floor.</p><p>I dare not reveal too many of the game's secrets for fear of spoiling some of the coolest things you'll encounter in your time, but I will say that you need to be in the right mood to play this game. It's one that uniquely hinges on quality communication, patience, and teamwork in a way I've never seen from co-op games.</p><p>In a way, only the Biped series of games requires this much constant teamwork and, even then, it's a very different kind of teamwork from what's expected of players in Elsewhere Electric. The only thing I want to see changed is the addition of a tutorial section. If Games by Stitch can get that added in a post-release update, this will easily be puzzle game of the year for me.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Interestingly enough, the phones I used the most in 2025 featured the Dimensity 9400, and it goes to show the amount of progress MediaTek made over the last two years.</p><p>Qualcomm is still in a dominant position in the high-end category, but MediaTek netted significant design wins, notably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>. These are two of the best camera-centric phones available today, and they're both powered by the Dimensity 9400.</p><p>Even though MediaTek is using regular Arm cores — Qualcomm switched to a custom design this year — there really isn't much of a difference. The X200 Pro takes the best photos of any phone I used until now, and it does a great job in demanding games. It holds up incredibly well in mundane situations as well, and I didn't see any differences when using on-device AI utilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZYcsJaGSFJFsUjMT8tuutD" name="2025 Phone Pile" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X200, Find X8, Find X8 Pro, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYcsJaGSFJFsUjMT8tuutD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With MediaTek also shifting to the 3nm node, there's no difference in efficiency either, and if anything, I got better battery life out of the X200 Pro than Qualcomm-based devices with a similar battery size. That isn't to say that Qualcomm is lagging behind; the 8 Elite is clearly one of the fastest mobile platforms available today, and it's good to see MediaTek offering an alternative.</p><p>It's clear that Chinese manufacturers want to use both MediaTek and Qualcomm designs in their phones; while the X200 Pro has the Dimensity 9400, Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a> is powered by Qualcomm, and the same is true of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> as well. However, these devices are limited to China, and that continues to be annoying.</p><p>What I'm trying to say is that MediaTek is somehow able to catch up to Qualcomm in the high-end category, and that's great news for the industry as a whole. With Samsung failing to make ground with Exynos and Huawei severely hobbled by trade restrictions, there is a distinct dearth of rivalry when it comes to mobile platforms, and it's good to see MediaTek utilizing its momentum to rival Qualcomm in this area.</p><p>MediaTek is making decent inroads into the U.S. as well, something it has struggled to do in the past. Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 tablets are powered by the Dimensity 9300+, and while these devices won't sell in as many numbers as the brand's phones, the fact that the manufacturer is using MediaTek-based designs globally is a huge endorsement.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EsXP28Ys32snGzfevsFTW3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsXP28Ys32snGzfevsFTW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, MediaTek still doesn't have a foothold with foldables — all the foldables I used in 2025 are powered by Qualcomm. We may get to see Chinese manufacturers using next-gen Dimensity platforms, but that may be a few years away. It's evident that MediaTek wants to continue making headway in the high-end and shore up its lead in the mid-range categories in the interim.</p><p>Another limiting factor in the past was that phones powered by MediaTek would take longer to get software updates, but that just isn't the case now. My Vivo X100 Pro made the switch to Android 15 at the same time as Qualcomm-based rivals, and MediaTek is working closely with major brands to ensure it provides the requisite drivers to roll out updates faster.</p><p>Ultimately, it's good to see there are two great choices of platforms for Android flagships, and I want MediaTek to continue its momentum with the Dimensity 9500.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Trump administration today laid out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf" target="_blank">AI Action Plan</a>, a 23-page document outlining over 90 policy decisions regarding AI to be implemented over the next year. The document, subtitled "winning the race," removes regulations and policies the administration views as restricting AI innovation in the country.</p><p>Michael Kratsios, who leads the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.npr.org/2025/07/23/nx-s1-5213904/trump-ai-regulations" target="_blank">NPR</a> that the Trump administration will consult with the AI industry and others to iron out the details. Kratsios compared the Biden-era regulations <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/eu-regulations-push-android-makers-update-policies-extend">to European Commission rules on technology</a>, saying "we cannot afford to go down Europe's innovation-killing regulatory path."</p><p>U.S. President Trump wrote in the plan that "it is a national security imperative for the United States to achieve and maintain unquestioned and unchallenged global technological dominance." That involves harnessing "the full power of American innovation," according to the President, which is why the AI Action Plan will deregulate AI research and development in major ways.</p><h2 id="how-the-trump-administration-plans-to-reshape-national-ai-development-2">How the Trump administration plans to reshape national AI development</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="y3svnJjFtZUz59875noaPo" name="trump.jpg" alt="Donald-trump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y3svnJjFtZUz59875noaPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1365" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The plan involves three pillars: innovation, infrastructure, and international diplomacy and security.</p><p>The first pillar includes policy recommendations intended to support AI development, such as supporting AI adoption in the federal government and encouraging open-source model development. It also plans to amend the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework to "eliminate references to misinformation, Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, and climate change."</p><p>The government plans to review LLMs to "ensure that their systems are objective and free from top-down ideological bias." It's not immediately clear how this will be evaluated, but the Trump administration will not grant government contracts to companies who don't meet this arbitrary threshold.</p><p>Additionally, the U.S. Departments of Labor and Education will prioritize AI skill development in an attempt to "empower American workers in the age of AI."</p><p>The second pillar focuses on supporting AI infrastructure in the U.S., and will streamline permits for AI data centers and eliminate or reduce climate-related restrictions. Specifically, the Trump administration wants to streamline or reduce regulations enforced by the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, among other environmental standards set by federal law.</p><p>Part of the infrastructure pillar includes expanding and stabilizing the U.S. electrical grid, strengthening the country's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-doubling-down-on-cybersecurity-using-ai">cybersecurity defenses</a>, and creating AI incident response plans at the federal level.</p><p>Finally, the international diplomacy and security pillar will increase U.S. exports in AI and technology to its allies while fortifying export controls on "countries of concern." Financing from the Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank will be used to create AI export packages for "countries willing to join America’s AI alliance."</p><p>For countries that the Trump administration believes to be a concern, it will look to strictly enforce export controls for technology needed for semiconductor manufacturing. The administration will simultaneously increase export control requirements beyond just major systems required for fabrication, expanding them to include component sub-systems. From there, the federal government plans to monitor and enforce these regulations on foreign exports.</p><p>"This would include monitoring emerging technology developments in AI compute to ensure full coverage of possible countries or regions where chips are being diverted," the plan explains. "This enhanced monitoring could then be used to expand and increase end-use monitoring in countries where there is a high risk of diversion of advanced, U.S.-origin AI compute."</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-ai-development-in-the-u-s-2">What this means for AI development in the U.S.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="xTaymBWk4xfFCEbEqErME8" name="Donald-Trump-Elon-Musk" alt="A photo of xAI CEO Elon Musk with U.S. President Donald Trump." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xTaymBWk4xfFCEbEqErME8.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The White House)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the current Biden-era regulations, development of AI must comply with standards intended to reduce the risk of misinformation and limit the climate impacts of building out AI infrastructure. The proposed AI Action Plan from the Trump administration aims to reverse many of these policies. It believes that cutting red tape will encourage AI innovation in the U.S., according to Kratsios.</p><p>Currently, this plan is made up of policy goals that the federal government wants to implement with "near-term execution." However, they will not be enacted immediately. The first wave of changes may come via executive orders issued by President Trump imminently, but others could take longer.</p><p>It's also possible that parts of the AI Action Plan could face legal challenges, specifically those targeting DEI and ideological bias. The provisions could be challenged as content-based discrimination, according to UC San Francisco School of Law professor Rory Little speaking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-releases-ai-action-plan-that-offers-a-split-with-biden-155057658.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACCLUmxb_-8g0_qZd--XqLuHivEyT6-TrcIkk2yn4K56TEC-lrKR3ruLZqz31fiUuPKRoM5GOEnrVgCypkXGNx9tsnAKzwJGqrJcX5rR42-wdLX5Dvy0-EhMDnJ6-b94Bijm8rSXXG3_XQR5F854BfYUrUux12c0CBP3XXQJqzuo" target="_blank">Yahoo Finance</a>. With that being said, experts including Little believe AI companies bidding for government contracts may comply with the Trump administration's demands even if they are unlawful.</p><p>For now, we will have to wait and see how the Trump administration's policy goals are implemented, and how it shakes up AI development in the U.S.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But if you don&apos;t need the latest in wearable technology, you may be wondering: what does this mean for the Pixel Watch 3? Will the top-rated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> finally get a permanent price drop? </p><p>While one can only speculate at this point, I&apos;m using my years of experience covering launches like this to tell you exactly what you can expect when the new wearable is unveiled. After all, Google Pixel Watch 3 deals are hardly unheard-of, but things might get more interesting once the popular wearable is officially deemed "last-gen". Let&apos;s dive in. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-we-know"><span>What we know</span></h3><p>Google recently confirmed that the 2025 Made by Google event will be held in New York City on August 20th. The company is already advertising the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> on its store&apos;s website, and while we&apos;ve received no <em>official </em>word on the Pixel Watch 4 just yet, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">leaks and rumors</a> suggest that the wearable will be revealed alongside the new phones during the event. </p><p>As for the specs, we don&apos;t know a lot about the new smartwatch just yet. Some credible leaks have indicated that the wearable will boast the same teardrop-inspired design as its predecessor accompanied by an increase in thickness, which could suggest a bigger battery. The Pixel Watch 4 might also have smaller bezels than the previous generation, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">another rumor</a> has suggested that the watch will boast the same Snapdragon chipset as the Pixel Watch 3. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Vista-watch-face" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 on a white counter, showing the Vista watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSGBRvCGVwcgWAgb6oCkYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is also certain to be equipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, which means you&apos;ll get access to all of the fancy new UI features based on Material 3 Expressive, such as scrolling animations, new color themes, and redesigned tiles that work seamlessly with the Pixel Watch&apos;s uniquely curved display. And as expected, the new OS will seamlessly incorporate all of the latest AI-boosted software features from Gemini.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 10 lineup of flagship phones, the Pixel Watch 4 is expected to retain the same price tag as its predecessor, starting at $349 for the 41mm version and setting you back $399 for the 45mm watch. You can also expect a ton of preorder deals to go live once the smartwatch is revealed on August 20th.  </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-will-the-google-pixel-watch-3-get-cheaper"><span>Will the Google Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-workout-screen" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 workout screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpDQa3apuBcsNLCXE2ggiP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now for the million dollar question: will the Pixel Watch 3 get cheaper when the Pixel Watch 4 is unveiled? It&apos;s hard to say with certainty, but I can make a guess based on past device launches. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Google Pixel Watch 2</a>, for example, was unveiled in 2023 with a starting price of $349, but now it&apos;s widely available for as low as $249. Slap on a discount during any major sale event and you can even find the last-gen watch for as little as $145. The problem is that its last-gen status also means that the wearable can be hard to find through some retailers. Indeed, the longer you wait to buy a last-gen device, the more likely it is that the item will be out of stock when you go to make your purchase. </p><p>In other words, I wouldn&apos;t necessarily wait for an official price drop to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>. Instead, simply shop for the watch during the next major sale event, such as Black Friday or one of the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/back-to-school">back-to-school sales</a> that are beginning to kick off across the web. After all, the Pixel Watch 3 dropped to $249.99 during Amazon Prime Day a few weeks ago, and the watch isn&apos;t even last-gen yet. I expect that record-smashing discount to return this fall, so if you don&apos;t mind waiting a bit longer, that might be the best time to buy. </p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="727b7f0f-2e80-4181-8f44-aa29ad304df2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/apDLG7FTha4HiWLEWcBvEH.png' alt="Render of the black Google Pixel Watch 3 45mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Google Pixel Watch (for now)</strong></em></p><p>With its incredibly sleek design and a bounty of Wear OS smarts, the Google Pixel Watch 3 easily ranks among the best Android smartwatches ever built.

Probably not, but slap on a discount and it may become one of the best value devices of 2025. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses channel the HSTN style with a unique flair, plus goodies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/preorder-now-to-get-metas-limited-edition-oakley-smart-glasses-before-everyone-else">Prizm 24K Polarized lenses</a>.</p><p>And while the upgrade to a 3K camera sounds nice on paper, the real upgrade everyone wants is better battery life. After all, the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">capture high-quality video</a>, but with 30 minutes max of recording time. It's hard to tote them around all day and snap footage without having to put them back in the charging case.</p><p>The company says Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses sport double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses — specifically, 8 hours of regular usage, while Ray-Ban is only rated at 4 hours — but does that actually pan out in real life? I put both glasses to the test to see which lasted longest and if Meta's claims were true. Get ready to get excited!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tldr-summary"><span>TLDR Summary</span></h2><p>There's a lot of data on this page, so here's the quick breakdown. Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses can capture roughly 60% more pictures and video than Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses on a single charge. You'll get about 1 hour longer music listening from the Oakleys, and about 10 minutes longer livestreaming sessions before needing a top-up.</p><p>The best battery life can be achieved by disabling the "Hey Meta" prompt. You can still access Meta AI to tapping and holding the side touchpad, so while disabling the keyword makes these less hands-free, it can significantly improve battery life. That is also the case with Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-camera-lab-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Camera lab test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-boxes-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with their respective boxes and charging cases on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tQ8ueTvMvpwFF8ED93kN3a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lab test is the theoretical battery life maximum you'll get out of these smart glasses. For this test, I put Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on a table, set the recording time for 3 minutes, and pressed the recording button. Once the glasses stopped recording, I'd press the button again to capture another video.</p><p>I repeated this process until both glasses' batteries were depleted. From there, I'd dock the glasses in the case, let it sync with the Meta AI app, then count the amount of video time recorded via each clip in the app.</p><div ><table><caption>Lab camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Video resolution</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded until battery drained</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>30</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>1080p</p></td><td  ><p>50</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>3K</p></td><td  ><p>35</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's clear that Meta put in some good work to optimize the battery life for Oakley Meta HSTN. The only battery life metric supplied by the company is "8 hours of average usage" on a single charge, but it doesn't specify whether it'll double the Ray-Bans' battery life for <em>specific</em>, high-power tasks.</p><p>While 50 minutes isn't quite double the battery life of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses' 30-minute time, it's much closer to double than I expected. Given there's not much difference in quality when using the 3K mode, as shown by my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">Oakley Meta HSTN camera review</a>, I recommend most users keep the default 1080p setting and enjoy longer recording time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-real-world-camera-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Real-world camera test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-both" alt="Wearing transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on my head at the same time" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QA6ushrJcKsjNPn4J3N78n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Meta only rates these glasses for the average usage time per charge, I spent a few days out and about with each pair of glasses to find out how accurate Meta's claims were. In this first test, my wife wore Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and I wore Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. Each was paired to a phone that we had with us, so they both had the same level of syncing and connectivity to the Meta AI app.</p><p>Every time one of us took a picture or recorded a video, the other person would do the same thing. I felt this was the most accurate way to "real world" test these glasses, as two people were wearing them full time, doing the same things.</p><div ><table><caption>Real-world camera test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th><th  ><p>Number of photos taken</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes of video recorded</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>75%</p></td><td  ><p>14</p></td><td  ><p>6:21 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 1)</p></td><td  ><p>3</p></td><td  ><p>77%</p></td><td  ><p>15</p></td><td  ><p>6:09 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:09 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 2)</p></td><td  ><p>3.5</p></td><td  ><p>36%</p></td><td  ><p>9</p></td><td  ><p>15:00 @ 3K</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>0%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>26:50 @ 1080p</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN (test 3)</p></td><td  ><p>1.25</p></td><td  ><p>38%</p></td><td  ><p>0</p></td><td  ><p>27:55 @ 1080p</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Lab tests showed a far more impressive difference between the two glasses, but more real-world usage reduces the gap quite a bit. Oakley Meta HSTN's battery life is a notable improvement over Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses when using the camera a lot, but mostly only when using the default 1080p video setting.</p><p>I'm not sure what you need to do to get to Meta's estimated 8-hour battery life, but I was never able to hit that unless I was barely using the glasses at all. Any time I specifically tried using the glasses, I found that 3-4 hours was a more reasonable expectation of battery life.</p><p>At best, Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses lasted about an hour longer than the Ray-Bans. I expected this to be better in real-world usage, especially considering the lab camera test results above. Still, it's a decent upgrade over the Ray-Bans, especially if you can get an entire hour of additional usage out of a single charge.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-live-streaming-test"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Live streaming test</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6" name="oakley-meta-hstn-with-box-02" alt="Warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its box and charging case on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Did you know you could livestream to Facebook or Instagram straight from your Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses? All you need to do is open either app, start a new live video, then follow the on-screen prompts to switch over to your glasses. You can switch between your phone's camera and the glasses camera at any time by double-pressing the capture button on your glasses.</p><p>As you might expect, livestreaming takes quite a toll on your glasses' battery life, but do the camera efficiency improvements on Oakley Meta HSTN transfer over to livestreaming? I started a live stream with each pair of glasses at 90% battery and let it run until the glasses died, checking the battery life every 10 minutes. Here are the results.</p><div ><table><caption>Instagram live streaming test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Minutes streamed</p></th><th  ><p>Battery Percentage at test end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>39 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>12%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta HSTN</p></td><td  ><p>48 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>13%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Based on the test, it looks like Oakley Meta HSTN can livestream for around 10-15 minutes longer than Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses. Not quite the gulf in battery life between the two glasses as we saw while recording 1080p video, but it's still a nice improvement!</p><p>If you're a person who livestreams from their glasses a lot, Oakley Meta HSTN are the better choice.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-audio-playback"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Audio playback</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B" name="oakley-meta-hstn-youtube-music" alt="Streaming YouTube Music on a pair of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BUGhas76oHZsfAVMaujh5B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While you're bound to take pictures and record videos with Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, the likelihood is that you'll be using it to listen to music, make phone calls, or talk to Meta AI more often.</p><p>Neither pair of glasses is designed for a single specific task for hours at a time, but I wanted to get an idea of how long you could reasonably stream music to them before they'd need a top-up. For this test, I set both glasses to 60% volume and streamed music from a YouTube Music playlist until one pair gave me the low battery warning.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Hours used</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at start</p></th><th  ><p>Battery % at end</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>85%</p></td><td  ><p>15%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours 25 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>83%</p></td><td  ><p>22%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/help/ai-glasses/303057485648146/?srsltid=AfmBOooq9MsFYQ3JeDLNeQ-wpcwqz35WwiP4hnEwndCZpL4Zr6xA8l5M">Meta estimates</a> that Oakley Meta HSTN will give you 5 hours of continuous audio playback, while Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses will deliver 4 hours. Based on the numbers in my tests, Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses drain at a rate of roughly 30% per hour of music streaming. Oakley Meta HSTN improves that to about 25% battery used per hour of music streaming.</p><p>That's a solid improvement, even if it means these won't be replacing your earbuds for all-day listening. At best, I can see getting 4 hours of audio playback from the Oakleys, while Ray-Bans top out at about 3 hours. Both glasses come about 1 hour short of Meta's estimates in my testing.</p><p>Querying Meta AI barely makes a dent in the battery, in my testing, and I would estimate that you would need to make hundreds of queries to drain either glasses' battery to any significant degree. Yes, this even includes using the "what do you see" type functionality where the glasses take a photo and Meta AI analyzes it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-battery-life-charging-time-and-conclusion"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN battery life: Charging time and conclusion</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-charging-app-01" alt="Looking at the battery life for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses and Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J6y4FYWdWduw9eBsz4YzMJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever your glasses' battery gets low, you'll need to dock them in the included charging case for a while to be able to use them again. While there are several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=meta+ray-ban+charger&crid=3324I3MFNSBXK&sprefix=razr%2B+2024%2Caps%2C127&ref=nb_sb_noss_1">charging cable alternatives on Amazon</a>, the likelihood is that you'll charge the glasses with the included case since that can be taken anywhere.</p><p>This case works just like a charging case that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a> ship with, so you'll need to occasionally charge the case itself so that it can keep your glasses juiced up. On average, the charging case can fully charge your glasses around 6 times before needing to be recharged itself. Here's how long it takes for the case to charge the glasses.</p><div ><table><caption>Music playback test</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Glasses</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-50%</p></th><th  ><p>Charge from 0-100%</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ray-Ban Meta</p></td><td  ><p>18 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>40 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Oakley Meta</p></td><td  ><p>20 minutes</p></td><td  ><p>50 minutes</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses charge slightly quicker than Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses, but this is mainly down to battery size differences. Oakley Meta HSTN has a larger battery so, at the same charging rate, you're going to see a difference in time. That 20-minute charge will get you 2 hours of music streaming, 22 minutes of 1080p video recording time, or dozens upon dozens of photos from the Oakleys.</p><p>Music streaming time has been improved, even if these still won't last long enough to replace a full day's worth of headphone or earbud usage. Considering the gap in quality between a proper set of earbuds and these glasses, though, you're not going to want to try to jam to your favorite tunes in the highest quality on them, anyway.</p><p>Overall, Meta has improved battery life on Oakley Meta HSTN versus Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, with the biggest improvements happening while using the camera on the glasses. From longer livestreaming time to nearly double the video capture time at the same resolution, this is a great upgrade for anyone who loves using their glasses as a way to capture their world.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="53a51519-eb07-4652-a84b-cede07eebe4c">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, better battery life, higher-resolution video capture, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster alleges that Nothing's potential new series branding addition could take on a "Lite" or "T" moniker. It doesn't seem like there's anything more concrete than this speculation, like a future device name.</p><p>However, judging by the monikers, both "Lite" and "T" suggest budget, but there's already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">the 3a series for that</a>.

The devices are typically under Nothing's flagship-oriented devices (think the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-launch">Phone 3</a>) in terms of specs. Where the Phone 3a Pro features the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, the "true flagship" Phone 3 picked up the newer Snapdragon 8s Gen 4. More than that, is the device's price point.</p><p>Thinking flagship, the Phone 3 debuted at $799 in the U.S. On the other hand, the 3a and 3a Pro launched for $379 and $459, respectively.</p><p>It's hard to imagine Nothing going any lower than its base 3a pricing, then you begin to wonder how specifications and how much lower things could go without losing consumers. Things could end up quite differently, though. Perhaps, what we're looking at is a change in Nothing's branding from the "a" series to "Lite" or possibly "T" (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">like OnePlus</a>).</p><p>Putting things into perspective, the OnePlus 13T sort of splits the gap in the company's recent launches, as the device sports a smaller 6.3-inch flat FHD Plus screen, but it sports the Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><p>For now, without concrete evidence, it's worth taking these rumors with a grain of salt.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Those who bought the 1.3-inch Watch 6 Classic won't mind, but this model will be about 10g heavier and may look too bulky on small wrists.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4byeivMPD99DP3ZCNdDZTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4byeivMPD99DP3ZCNdDZTG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-side-view" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on the left side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PWL6aEAvifsKmW9YPQfxzZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-quick-button" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on top of an ornamental gold bowl, the right side with three buttons showing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m5SWPtuvZkHymD45EFs36a.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung also transplanted the third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a> from the Galaxy Watch Ultra.

The left side is quite stark, flat, and chunky, but <em>you</em> won't see it, only others.</p><p>The normal Watch 8 display looks naked by comparison, but that also makes it that much lighter and skinnier. Unless you're accustomed to heavier smartwatches, the Classic's thick steel case might feel burdensome — especially for sleep tracking.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-battery-and-charging"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic: Battery and charging</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfgCE7gAWiXdDJEJjZgc4L" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-charging" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic atop its charger on carpet, the display showing 4% battery and 1 hr 26 minutes until full." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfgCE7gAWiXdDJEJjZgc4L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Samsung promises 30 hours per charge with always-on display (AOD) or 40 hours normally.</strong></li><li><strong>The Watch 8 Classic takes about 90 minutes to hit 100% power.</strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorials</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/should-you-upgrade-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-watch-8-classic"><strong>Is the Galaxy Watch 8 worth the upgrade?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-doesnt-support-quick-release-bands-anymore"><strong>It's the end of an era for the Watch 8 Classic</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/what-size-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-8-classic-should-you-buy"><strong>Which size of Galaxy Watch 8 should you buy?</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Most Galaxy Watches last between 1–2 days, with the capacity slowly fading over time.

Even with AOD and the "Hey Google" wake word active, my Watch 8 Classic lasted across two nights of sleep tracking. Dozens of Gemini commands (plus AOD) burned about 20% battery across a full afternoon, but even that put it on pace for 25 hours; with more casual usage, it lasts twice as long.</p><p>For workouts, two hours of dual-band GPS tracking and a fully bright display burned about 20% battery, so 10 hours seems like a reasonable estimate with a full charge.</p><p>You may see faster battery burn if you spend more time outdoors or use music storage.

Google and third-party apps still require a full Tile to themselves. But I'm hoping Samsung will make this format available to other devs.</p><p>The other new tool is the Now Bar, which you trigger with a double-finger tap gesture. It pulls up contextually relevant info like your current playlist or timer onto the main watch face, or else takes you to your most recent notification if nothing is pertinent.

Considering Samsung has been selling the Watch 7 for under $200 recently, spending $500 would be a bitter bill even without the controversial changes.</p><p>If you're a die-hard Samsung fan looking to get healthier, the Galaxy Watch 8 will fit the bill for less...but anyone hesitating over the Classic will <em>definitely</em> hate the base model. And even if Samsung switches back to the status quo with the Galaxy Watch 9, we probably won't see a new Classic until 2027.</p><p>So it's really a simple decision. If you like the bezel and can trade in your old Classic to Samsung to cut the bill in half, I'd suggest buying the Watch 8 Classic; you may find that the new design grows on you. For others, this heavy, expensive smartwatch may be the wrong fit.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7a2885c9-e0e2-475c-a8a3-d5ceddd89e62">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster can allegedly "confirm" the Galaxy S26 Edge will feature a "larger battery" whenever Samsung debuts it next year. Rumors add that this bigger battery will occur, thanks to some new "battery material technology" that Samsung is allegedly thinking of implementing.</p><p>It also seems that Samsung isn't pulling back on its interest in creating thin (and even thinner) phones.</p><p>The post on X claims Samsung is investing resources into creating a Galaxy S26 Edge that's even thinner the S25 Edge. The tipster's weren't accompanied by any estimations for its battery capacity or slimmer measurement, so we'll have to take this with a grain of salt for now.</p><p>Samsung debuted the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a>, the S25 series' fourth member, in May. We're likely still a great distance away from a second-generation launch, but there are some recent developments to consider.</p><h2 id="gaining-the-edge-2">Gaining the Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">with the "beyond slim" tagline</a>, as the company truly pushed the sleek and slim idea behind slab phones. The device sports a 6.7-inch display and a dual camera array (200MP primary lens), but it's main eye-catching aspect was its 5.8mm profile. The S25 Edge is slimmer than the rest of the S25 series; however, it came at the price of its battery.</p><p>There was bound to be a trade-off, and it seems the device's 3,900mAh battery was the result of thinner aspirations. Moreover, Samsung outfit the phone with a 25W wired charging adapter, which could reach 55% charge in thirty minutes.</p><p>A "larger battery" would undoubtedly help the device go for longer periods of time. How Samsung could go about this is key. Some users on X theorize Samsung might go down the silicon-carbon route with the S26 Edge. We've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">similar rumors reported earlier this year</a> from South Korea, so that's one side of the speculation.</p><p>A more recent report claims that Samsung has switched gears and is now actively chasing down a new battery material known as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>." Supposedly, this material can "significantly" increase a device's battery capacity, though it's unclear as to how much that could be. It's also been stated that SUS CAN could benefit future Galaxy phones by bringing greater energy density and quickening charging speeds.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The former is something small and light, while the latter can have your family member tossing confetti into the air or something else.</p><p>Google says these clips are six seconds long and that users can share them after creating.</p><h2 id="clips-remixes-2">Clips & Remixes</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:632px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.94%;"><img id="bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-splash" alt="Google Photos begins receiving a photo-to-video feature that lets users turn their static images into short six second clips." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bSgj63ZawsE5pPcMVeHg2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="632" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:554px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.30%;"><img id="drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D" name="google-photos-image-to-video-options" alt="Photo-to-video in Google Photos lets users choose between two options to create a quick, six second animated clip." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/drQBQndTVAXRymEX8F3v4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="554" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:630px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.24%;"><img id="MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D" name="google-photos-remix-styles-selection" alt="Google Photos' Remix lets users decide which unique style they'd like AI to turn their photos into, like comic or sketch styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="630" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.36%;"><img id="nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D" name="google-photos-remix-wedding-example" alt="Google Photos introduces "Remix," a way to reimagine your photos in unique styles like animation, comic, sketch, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="534" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Similarly, users can also "save" their AI-generated clip, if they'd like, or they can "regenerate" to try something new until it's right.</p><p>Google's photo-to-video feature in its Photos app is rolling out today on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>In a similar AI-created vein, Google highlights another feature headed for devices today called "Remix." Remixing your photos lets users reimagine them in a whole new light. Think about turning your Christmas photos into an anime snapshot or a simple birthday party photo into a sketch. Google adds that users will find other options, such as "Comic" and "3D animation."</p><p>Lastly, the app can generate remixes of people and pets. Google says Remix will begin rolling out in Photos "in the next few weeks" on Android and iOS devices in the U.S.</p><p>Additionally, Google reiterates that photos reimagined through Remix will be marked with a SynthID digital watermark, so others know that the content they're viewing was AI-generated. Despite rolling out officially to all users, Google warns that these features (Remix and photo-to-video) are experimental. It states the AI generation could get things wrong and encourages users to provide feedback via the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons upon generation.</p><h2 id="a-hub-for-creation-2">A Hub for Creation</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.77%;"><img id="9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H" name="google-photos-create-tab-example" alt="Google is preparing a new hub for AI generative functions in its Photos app called "Create."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest features rolling out for Google Photos will fly solo for a little while; however, the company plans to introduce a new "Create" tab in August.</p><p>This tab will be featured along the bottom of the app's UI, alongside other options like "Photos," "Collection," and "Search."

With previous iterations, the cover screen was relegated to more basic games, as it was just too narrow to really enjoy much of anything else. But, unfolded? Well, then you have a tablet for a more immersive and pleasant experience.</p><p>In my time with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, this has largely continued to be the case. Playing games like Threes (yes, I still play it), Balatro, and Letterlike is quick and easy to fire up and play one-handed. I even dabbled a bit with trying to use it as an awkwardly tall Game Boy for some Pokémon Pinball, but that wasn't really my cup of tea.</p><h2 id="big-and-beautiful-2">Big and beautiful</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-11" alt="Backbone Pro connected to Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 leaning on GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyuyPjn43yLkUkFjU8KvKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, the star of the show is the inner display, which Samsung has made better than ever. There are practically no awkward crease distortions to speak of, which is nice for a change. Plus, the 8-inch OLED panel simply looks incredible, especially when playing modern games or retro games that are upscaled.</p><p>Before getting into the gameplay itself, let's talk about controls. I absolutely despise trying to play platforming games with just a touchscreen, so I have quite a collection of different phone controllers. I recently picked up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Backbone-Gaming-Controller-Bluetooth-Pro-Level-Console/dp/B0DQM23MLZ/">Backbone Pro</a> controller, so I connected the Fold 7 and was off to the races.</p><p>However, I quickly noticed that, unlike the Fold 6 and traditional phones, the Fold 7 is so thin that there was a gap between the phone and the back of the controller. Backbone includes a few adapters in the box to help mitigate this, but really, Bluetooth controllers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">8BitDo Ultimate Mobile Controller</a> will give the phone a bit more support on the back.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4636px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-10" alt="Gap between Backbone Pro and the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S2zohdrRgvkmvWHtDNa4bY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4636" height="2608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to actually playing those games, the Fold 7 is a beast, and there's really no way around it. It chews through even the most demanding games found on the Play Store, but that's to be expected. Where the real strength comes through is with emulation, and for the most part, the Fold 7 doesn't disappoint here either.</p><h2 id="windows-and-playstation-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-2">Windows and PlayStation on the Galaxy Z Fold 7</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4202px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-6" alt="Fallout 4 on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 via GameSir GameHub (Winlator)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6BckHPbymBsh8MgqkK5CqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4202" height="2364" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I didn't sit back and play through games for hours on end, but I did try out Fallout 4 and Hades 2 via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">GameHub (Winlator)</a>, Tears of the Kingdom via Citron, and Burnout Paradise via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">RPCSX</a>. For whatever reason, I couldn't get either Fallout or Hades to launch using the standard build of Winlator.</p><p>But after importing them via the GameHub app, both games fired right up, which I was thankful to see. The only real problem I experienced was frame drops in certain scenes at the beginning of Fallout 4. Even then, it never dropped below 23-25fps, reaching a peak of around 58fps. There's a decent chance this could be a caching issue, so I'll be taking another look to see if that's the case.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4834px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-1" alt="Burnout Paradise via RPCSX on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wxj8Kg7BfLAV6b6ZbPvYFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4834" height="2719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a> with RPCSX, once I got everything set up properly, I was able to get Burnout Paradise loaded, and things were looking pretty good with around a 30fps during the opening cut scene. And then it rapidly dropped to around 10 fps before bottoming out at 0fps.</p><p>What's weird about this is that the background music was still playing, and there weren't even any audio crackles or anything to make it seem like the game was frozen. Perhaps there's some tinkering to be done, but I can only assume that it's more to do with the emulator itself, as other games I tried wouldn't even load.</p><h2 id="switching-it-up-2">Switching it up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4715px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-8" alt="The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZDkJ8K3zCS3GrXFCEhCktY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4715" height="2652" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, it's always fun to see how well Switch games will run on new hardware. Currently, I have at least five different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">Switch emulators</a> installed, but with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, Citron seems to be one of the most popular of the bunch. So, what better way to test Switch emulation than with Tears of the Kingdom?</p><p>This was a patented case of "they had me in the first half," because the gameplay was pretty smooth, hovering around 30fps. Things slowed down a bit after the encounter with Ganondorf, dropping to between 20-25fps, but still totally playable.</p><p>Unfortunately, once I grabbed Link's tunic from the first chest of the game and started to head out of the cave, it just stopped. Unlike Burnout on RPCSX, the screen froze for a moment or two before the game crashed entirely, taking me back to the main Citron screen.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-monster-2">It's a monster</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4208px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6nkxFeq6cqsdNJ8FeHuXdY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-gaming-4" alt="Balatro Menu Screen on Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6nkxFeq6cqsdNJ8FeHuXdY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4208" height="2367" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's worth pointing out that while all three of the aforementioned emulators include custom GPU support, I stuck with the stock configuration. This is mostly because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/why-does-retro-gaming-and-emulation-matter-so-much">Turnip drivers</a> still aren't tuned for the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and it provided more of an "out-of-the-box" test bed.</p><p>That being said, I look forward to testing out more games on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, seeing what is and isn't possible. This is really a "do-it-all" phone, as it can help pass the time while you're waiting in line at the store, get work done from wherever, and double as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a> when it's time to unwind.

This UI update specifically involves the notification that appears after connecting your earbuds, which displays each bud's and the case's battery percentage. Google is seemingly working on massively reworking this by placing your case and earbud icons inside colorful circles.</p><p>At full charge, the Fast Pair UI will encircle your devices in a light green container. The top of the circle features the UI's old battery icon that was previously placed beneath each icon beside the percentage. The tipster shows that as your device's power is consumed, Google plans for the circle to recede, but it will also slowly change colors.</p><p>As your power drops, the circle changes from green to yellow (half battery/under) and finally to red (low battery).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="qQeVMDiAvCwhuYjn8T9JB4" name="google-android-os-fast-pair-battery-ui-leaked" alt="A leaked snapshot from a tipster, regarding Google's potential Fast Pair UI rework for battery notifications.

Additionally, Fast Pair's notification will indicate which earbud is which (left and right), as well as a "C" for case.</p><p>The tipster adds that they discovered these Fast Pair UI changes in version 25.28.31 of Google Play Services. As usual, discoveries like this often come without an arrival date in mind. The company could simply keep this on the shelf, but there's a chance we might see it, considering Google's recent Android OS design changes. All we're left with now is the waiting game.</p><h2 id="all-about-being-more-expressive-2">All about being more 'Expressive'</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kdzzQkjeSpjkYjKJxhHxiF" name="Material-3-Expressive-Leak" alt="The leaked Material 3 Expressive design." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdzzQkjeSpjkYjKJxhHxiF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google / Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google's supposed Fast Pair battery UI rework gives strong Apple AirPod vibes. The company may have taken inspiration from its competitor for Android, but there's another thing to keep in mind: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a>. During its Android 16 launch, the company highlighted its most significant Android OS redesign, nicknamed M3 Expressive. At its core, Google says it wants to craft a UI that "feels good" and "makes sense."</p><p>Google intended to help Android's UI guide users to keep them focused and engaged with what they're doing. To achieve that, M3 Expressive focuses on colors, shapes, sizes, motion, and containment.</p><p>Many of these attributes can be placed right beside this new Fast Pair battery UI change we've seen leaked. Considering Google hasn't given that particular aspect of its OS a face-lift, maybe it's finally time.</p><ul><li><strong>Earbuds deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/headphone-and-speaker-deals"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/browse/electronics/shop-headphones-by-type/3944_133251_1095191_1230614?sort=best_match&cat_id=3944_133251_1095191_1230614_1230476&stores=3081&ps=40"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=earbuds&crid=2RWE1G9N1EIF&sprefix=earbuds%2Caps%2C161&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/audio/all-audio/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/earbuds"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As Samsung parades its latest wearables around, showing off their fitness and health tracking prowess, band compatibility hasn't been discussed much.</p><p>One of the things that I loved about Samsung Galaxy Watch models was the use of standard quick-release connectors for their bands. Until the Galaxy Watch 7, you could use bands compatible with all generations, dating back to the Watch 4, Watch 3, or even the OG Galaxy Watch, allowing for seamless interchangeability across all generations leading up to the Watch 7. This was a huge advantage as it opened the door to countless options.</p><p>Disappointingly, the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic no longer use quick-release connectors. I'm really upset about it.</p><h2 id="what-purpose-does-this-move-serve-2">What purpose does this move serve?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-22" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tE6yAzMuXuMFJSvjCcNjSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung isn't the only smartwatch maker that favors proprietary connectors. Google does the same with its Pixel Watch family. But the difference is, Google has always done it that way. Additionally, all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch" target="_blank">Pixel Watch</a> models can use interchangeable bands, as they all utilize the same connector. It presents a unified front and solidifies the Pixel Watch brand.</p><p>But I don't understand why Samsung would move away from quick-release bands after seven generations of smartwatches. Being able to use standard bands designed for another Galaxy Watch on any other model made it more cost-effective to buy a Samsung wearable. You could hold on to your old bands and reuse them, or buy previously released straps that tend to be cheaper than newly released ones. Upcycling older bands for new smartwatches is also a more sustainable approach.</p><p>According to Samsung, the change was made so the Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic could sit flatter on the wrist. However, I am not sure if this small design change was worth trading in quick-release connectors. Do the benefits of a flatter fit outweigh the advantages of universal strap compatibility?</p><p>It's a change that no one really asked for, and yet, Samsung felt the need to lose what was arguably one of the best features of its wearables.</p><h2 id="is-the-new-dynamic-lug-system-better-than-quick-release-connectors-2">Is the new Dynamic Lug System better than quick-release connectors?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-dynamic-lug-system" alt="How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4ZG5awowtoQCwmocUtSRc.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="634" height="356" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">How to use the Dynamic Lug System on Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic bands. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the Dynamic Lug System, you click one button and the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">Galaxy Watch 8 band</a> pops off. Plugging a strap back in is very straightforward. You simply align the connectors and push the band in. It clicks into place swiftly. It's very much like the connectors on the Samsung Galaxy One-Click Watch bands that we've seen before.</p><p>Admittedly, the new Dynamic Lug System is quicker than quick-release pins, but there was nothing explicitly wrong with the quick-release connectors to begin with. I suppose speed matters to a lot of people, but it's only a few seconds' difference either way. Besides the flatter fit, I don't think the time difference in swapping out bands justifies such a major shift either.</p><p>I value backwards compatibility and the use of an industry standard a lot more than quicker band swap time or a thinner wearable.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-just-samsung-users-who-will-be-effected-by-this-2">It's not just Samsung users who will be effected by this</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV" name="Amazfit Balance" alt="Amazfit Balance smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sN2PwAwAovu4As5JMDUgV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is a big slice of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">wearable pie</a>. Many quick-release 20mm and 22mm bands are marketed or designed specifically for Samsung Galaxy Watch models, but because they use standardized pins, they can also be used by many other smartwatches. This is why this shift also affects other brands as well.</p><p>OnePlus, Amazfit, Garmin, Withings, and Xiaomi smartwatches all use the standard 22mm or 20mm quick-release bands that the last seven generations of Galaxy Watches used.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-bottom-sensors" alt="The bottom of the titanium Garmin Fenix 8, showing the charging port, QuickFit watch band connectors, and etched info about the watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2btkgXUAf9EJFtmPkPynX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You could easily use a nice Amazfit band on your Galaxy Watch or vice versa. Everyone was happy. Either way, both sides profited from this arrangement.</p><p>Now that Samsung has moved on to a new system, consumers won't be able to enjoy as wide a pool when buying smartwatch bands. As usual, it's the consumers like me and you who lose in the end.</p><p>And what can be done about this? The brutal truth is there's not much to do besides complaining and hoping for a better future. Maybe Samsung will revert to quick-release pins with the Galaxy Watch 9, but I'm not counting on it. For now, we just have to accept it as is or buy older Galaxy wearables if this is a deal breaker.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="44fdffef-7e89-458f-9388-19a79a37dc0c">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Switching things up</strong></em></p><p>Like it or not, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic ditches the standard quick-release bands for Samsung's proprietary Dynamic Lug ones.

Joining is Samsung's executive vice president and Head of Mobile Display Product Planning Team, Hojung Lee, who states, "This new panel not only builds consumer confidence in foldable OLED durability..."</p><p>Samsung says it has conducted tests with the Fold 7's display and can report that the device can withstand 500,000 folds, up significantly from 200,000 folds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">previous Z Fold models</a>. Let's not forget about the original Galaxy Fold that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-fold-dies-after-120000-folds-cnet-torture-test">only survived 120,000 folds</a>.</p><p>The post states Samsung Display leveraged a "shock-resistant" structure for its new OLED panel, which took inspiration from bulletproof glass. The company says the elastic outer layer (the one that takes the bullet's impact energy) is the idea behind the Fold 7's Ultra Thin Glass (UTG) outer layer. Samsung says it increased this layer's thickness by roughly 50%, while also adding a new "high-elastic adhesive" to each layer of the OLED.</p><p>In short, this was designed to increase the display's "recovery" fold after fold. It seems this has worked, as Samsung taps Bureau Veritas, which conducted the inspection. According to its tests, the Fold 7's display has remained operable after 500,000 folds, which Samsung says equates to around 10 years of use for the average user.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-fold-7-has-turned-heads-2">The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has turned heads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This year-expectancy drops a little for "heavy use" users, as Samsung states the Fold 7 can last roughly six years with ~200 estimated folds per day.</p><p>Samsung's been on a tear, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7">detailing the various advancements</a> taken to improve its slimmest-ever Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Last week, the company discussed what it took to make the device so sleek. Such upgrades include the phone's new 3rd generation Armor FlexHinge, which cuts down its profile by 27% and enables a flatter, more open inner display when fully opened.</p><p>The Fold 7 has achieved an 8.9mm measurement when folded, a drastic drop from its previous iterations. This was helped in part by Samsung's removal of the S Pen.</p><p>On the other hand, all of these changes have seemed to benefit Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">as a report from South Korea</a> shows the Fold 7 leading the sales charge over the Flip 7. This is the first time a Galaxy Z Fold device has led Samsung's sales for its foldable department. While the Flip is typically the one consumers reach for, the Fold 7 is carrying roughly 60% of the pre-orders this year.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5649196389409786183&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&track=ac-us-2464517706506802132&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-1617837727828318802&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=Samsung%20details%20how%20it%20made%20its%20slimmest%20Galaxy%20Z%20Fold%207%20and%20Z%20Flip%207&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fsamsung-development-behind-thinnest-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-5445094904884312851-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-6047595860180987069&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1140351136575126786&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7170f3fe-1d43-4c6a-adb1-0fad10f15122">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vdh6Duir2Ft8yo3JpKatrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its thinnest-ever book-style foldable.

However, some users of the ultra flagship phone are having a bitter experience with the camera after the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review" target="_blank">One UI 7</a> update.</p><p>Several Galaxy S23 series users have shared their disappointment in using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> camera as the photos taken after the update are seemingly blurry, washed out, and feel less sharp (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/galaxy-s23-camera-quality-one-ui-7/">Tech-Issues Today</a>).</p><p>Some users who have installed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15" target="_blank">Android 15</a>-based One UI 7 update have taken to forums, including Reddit and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r2.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S/Camera-quality-degraded/td-p/20094032" target="_blank">Samsung community pages</a>, to share their frustration as their Galaxy S23 series cameras aren't clicking pictures as well as they previously did.

While some complain about the blurry images, washed-out colors (even in bright sunlight), others seem to be facing issues with the camera app too. They include slight delays when switching between modes or going back and forth between the selfie shooter or the primary cameras. And for some, the preview appears to be not loading up immediately.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra/comments/1lxyvi3/camera_delay_with_oneui7">Camera Delay with OneUI7?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS23Ultra">r/GalaxyS23Ultra</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>A Galaxy S23 FE user has also noted that the device's camera captures better in low light when running the One UI 6.1 update, as opposed to the latest One UI 7 update.</p><p>The publication further notes some users have come up with their own fixes like clearing the camera cache, resetting camera preferences, tweaking features like scene optimizer, experimenting with pro mode, and several similar tweaks.

Given Meta's pedigree with regular updates and feature additions, there's little doubt that we'll see tweaks, new features, and maybe even image quality upgrades as these are on the market longer.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="429450a6-89de-4486-b28b-9f4324cb1a5d">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZRdrhc9epKCVuFe6gCHxd5.jpg' alt="The Oakley Meta HSTN glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring more frame styles, more lens options, better battery life, higher-resolution video capture, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

It allowed you to play with the feel of your home screen and adjust things like animation flow and wallpaper transitions. Now with One UI 8, Samsung is doubling down by letting you tweak how apps pop open too.</p><p>While Home Up received a big animation upgrade with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, app launch animations were still off-limits.
