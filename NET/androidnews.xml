                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>We're less than a week away from the official Black Friday phone deals, but many have already launched early discounts leading up to the sale. For one, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926uzaaxaa/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung is cutting up to $650 off the Galaxy S24 Plus</strong></a> when you trade in a qualifying device, or $275 off without a trade-in. You can also save an additional $75 when you go with Jade Green, Sapphire Blue, or Sandstone Orange. While the S24 Plus is often passed over for either the smaller base-level S24 or the larger, high-powered S24 Ultra, it's still a decent effort from Samsung—especially at a discount.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 Plus has a nice 6.7-inch AMOLED display, 256GB of storage, all-day battery life, and an excellent set of cameras. We also like this phone for its small bezels and overall design, as well as its impressive performance speeds and the promise of seven years of updates. Plus, it comes with the latest Galaxy AI features, which are a selling point for many users.</p><p>Normally, this phone is also pretty expensive, so the discount straight from Samsung is pretty solid, especially for regular enjoyers of the OEM.</p>

Even if you don't want to trade in an old device, Samsung is offering $275 off for its early Black Friday sale, as well as another $75 off when you go with certain colors.</p><p>And if you do have an eligible device to trade in, this deal is definitely worth considering as it'll bring the price of this powerful phone way down.</p><p>👀<strong>Alternate Black Friday deal: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-s24-256gb-unlocked-onyx-black/6569843.p"><strong>Get $200 off the Galaxy S24 Plus at Best Buy</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24/buy/galaxy-s24-plus-256gb-unlocked-sm-s926uzaaxaa/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e205ce06-2eab-441f-9265-01c099979bdb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus:" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if:</strong> you want a good deal on a powerful Samsung phone that's normally pretty expensive; you're looking for a phone with excellent cameras; getting through the day without charging your phone is a major priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer a compact-sized phone; the price tag is still a little higher than what you'd prefer; you're a casual phone user and don't need something so performance-heavy.</p><p>We liked this year's Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus when it was released, especially because of its improved RAM and display specs. The phone also includes Samsung's latest Galaxy AI features, such as Generative Edit, Instant Slo-Mo, and more.</p><p>The S24 Plus gets its super-powerful performance from the included 12GB of RAM, and from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor. Its cameras also offer solid video and photo capture, perhaps second only to the Google Pixel lineup.</p><p>We also love this year's display upgrade for the S24 Plus, which offers an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">easy-on-the-eyes display with a PWM rate</a> of 492Hz for those who are sensitive to phone screens. Other noteworth details about this phone are its IP68 water and dust resistance, its inclusion of seven years of software updates, and its all-around great user experience design.</p><p>It is worth pointing out a couple of small quirks with the S24 Plus. For one, there's no S Pen support, so if you want to use the first-party stylus, you'll have to go with the upgraded Ultra model (though the stylus is included with that configuration).</p><p>Additionally, while this phone is smaller than the Ultra with a 6.7-inch display, it's no compact phone, and it may simply be too big for some. In that case, you may want to consider the base-level S24.</p><p>However, if you want a discount on a great Samsung Galaxy device at a serious discount, this deal might be worth checking out.</p>

But even with these deals, they're still expensive for fitness watches. If you don't know if you <em>like</em> Garmin's training software yet, you may regret spending too much out of the gate.</p><p>Of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/early-black-friday-garmin-deals-2024-ditch-your-old-smartwatch-and-save-big-on-forerunner-venu-and-more">Black Friday Garmin deals</a> available for a reasonable $199 or less, the Forerunner 55 is way too old for first-timers, the Instinct 2 display is too low-res for people coming from an AMOLED, and the Venu Sq 2 is just too limited in terms of Garmin's best training tools.</p><p>A Forerunner 165 or Vivoactive 5 introduces you to what makes Garmin so popular with athletes. And of these two, the Vivoactive 5 is a well-rounded smartwatch that's usually pricier, making it the better Black Friday discount.</p>

<p>I highly reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> and found it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-accuracy-vs-two-best-cheap-fitness-trackers">beat other cheap fitness watches for accuracy</a>, so it's also a compelling option at this $199 price. It has niche running tools like daily suggested runs, running form analysis, running power, training effect, and an altimeter for judging elevation for hikes and stairs — all of which the Vivoactive 5 lacks.</p>

<p>If you're a regular runner or hiker like me, the Forerunner 165 should tempt you more; I really wish the Vivoactive 5 could track elevation, too. But for other athletes considering a Garmin switch, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/compare/?compareProduct=1057989&compareProduct=1055469">Garmin product comparison</a> shows where the Vivoactive 5 pulls ahead.</p><p>Essentially, the Vivoactive 5 doesn't make you pay $50 extra for music storage for your Spotify or Deezer playlists, and it has stronger Gorilla Glass 3 display protection. It offers a wider array of sports modes like basketball, skiing, or rowing, the ability to see greens or hazards while golfing, and even has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">wheelchair mode</a>. And if you care about sleep tracking, it has the newer Sleep Coach that guides you on how much sleep you need.</p><p>You may prefer the Vivoactive 5's aluminum bezel to the Forerunner's polymer bezel, but it's ultimately a matter of preference. And that goes for whichever of these two you choose; they both offer most of the same training metrics, so only you can decide which will appeal to you more!</p>

It offers everything you could ask for in a budget tablet, such as a stylish and lightweight design, great battery life, and storage expansion using microSD. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-11-64gb-wi-fi-graphite/6566195.p"><strong>Black Friday deal knocks nearly 38% off</strong></a> the list price, giving you a cool $70 in savings. $149.99 is the lowest recorded price to date and this tablet has only gone this low a few times before.

The one major differentiating factor between the Tab A series and the Tab S series is the lack of S Pen support. This is in no way a deal-breaker as for the asking price, you already get a solid package.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a lightweight tablet with a large display; you don't want to spend a lot; you need expandable storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need S Pen support; you need more than 128GB of built-in storage; you need superior gaming performance.</p><p>Amazon's Fire tablets are usually our go-to pick for really cheap tablets, but this Black Friday deal on the Galaxy Tab A9 Plus is hard to pass up. It runs One UI based on Android 14 and will be getting the Android 15 update. It sports a large 11-inch LCD display with a Full-HD resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. It's quite slim too at 6.9mm, and doesn't weigh a lot at 480g. It's probably a good idea to use one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-plus-cases">best cases of the A9 Plus</a>. This deal is for the Wi-Fi variant only, but there's an LTE option for $50 more, should you need it.</p><p>64GB of storage might not seem like much, but there's a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot on the Tab A9 Plus which can be used to add up to 1TB of additional storage. For a budget tablet, Samsung still offers four speakers which is very good. It's powered by the Snapdragon 695 5G chipset, which is decently powerful for running basic tasks. Last but not least, you get a massive 7,040mAh battery, but the charging speed is limited to 15W.</p>

A law proposed in parliament would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/australia-wants-to-impose-the-strictest-social-media-ban-for-kids-yet">ban social media access for all children under the age of 16</a>, placing stiff fines on platforms that don't comply.</p><p>While I'll admit most social media does little more than turn our gray matter into Nickelodeon slime, this seems like the plot to some Dirty Dancing sequel without Patrick Swayze and Jeniffer Grey to save the day. Nobody puts Baby in a corner, but we will try to keep her from using Instagram.</p>

<p>The proposed law is only half-formed, stating that access to social media would be blocked while keeping sites like Twitch and Telegram available. Apparently, following the Kardashians is more harmful than Hot Tub streamers or white supremacy in the eyes of Aussie lawmakers and parent groups. It would be up to Australia's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant to determine how to set and enforce rules, who freely admits that “technology change is always going to outpace policy."</p><p>I don't live in Australia and my kids have all grown up to lead happy and productive lives. I have no skin in the game here. But as a parent and someone who <em>seems</em> to have more understanding of the internet and the unique challenges it can create, I have to say how stupid this sounds.</p>
<p><em><strong>“Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?"</strong></em></p><p>Those are the words of Emma, the mother of a 12-year-old boy who was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl4dyjg57do">threatened over Snapchat</a>. Emma thinks working with her kids and being a parent is wasting her time and would rather have the government decide how her son James and <em>your</em> son or daughter access information.</p><p>Emma could also sit down with James and monitor his use of the internet, give reasonable access to device time once things like chores or homework are finished, and read through Snapchat with James so she is aware of any issues that may arise. You know, be a mother.</p><p>I don't blame parents like Emma. Raising children is the hardest thing a person can ever face; they're unpredictable, unruly, unappreciative, and often unresponsive. You will feel like you're not doing the right thing at least half the time, and the other half will make you feel like you're doing too much. Not everyone is cut out for this level of responsibility, and seeking help is a great idea.</p><p>Having the government decide your kids (and my kids) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-tiktok-ban-isnt-about-privacy-its-about-politics">can't use TikTok</a> is not the right kind of help. When parents like Emma realize this — and they will one day — it may be too late.</p>

<p>None of this absolves social media companies of any wrongdoing. There is no reason why Snapchat should do nothing when older children threaten a young man with videos of them wielding a machete. While they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-case-against-tiktok-might-spur-the-section-230-reform-we-desperately-need">should not be responsible</a> for the things people post on their platform, they do have an obligation to try and prevent it.</p><p>Snap, Inc. could implement an age verification system that blocks certain words, requires video uploads to be previewed and approved before they're sent, and should require parents to become involved <em>before</em> a child signs up to use their service. They don't because they aren't required to do it. Australia could be the country that forces their hand instead of making a kid check a box, promising that they're of age. Tech companies only do the right thing when they're forced to do the right thing.</p>
<p>Bans do not work. They're easy to circumvent, and governments around the world have tried them and were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-gaming-shutdown-law-end-163212494.html">forced to remove them</a> after a review of their effectiveness <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/utah-law-restricting-youth-social-media-use-blocked-by-judge-2024-09-11/">or legality</a>.</p><p>They can also be harmful, pushing children away from loosely regulated services like X or Instagram toward the free-for-all that is the "unpoliced" internet world of user forums. You may not want your kids to see everything TikTok has to offer, but would you rather they visit websites where they can buy MDMA with cryptocurrency?  That 0.001 Bitcoin and a post office box is a pretty low hurdle when it comes to harmful activities.</p>
<p>Governments of the world can help. They need to work with social media platforms and tech giants, ignoring the obnoxious demands of fringe parent groups to make it easier for <strong>you</strong> to help your child be safe on the internet. Banning safe access is the same as banning dancing or "ethnic" music in 1950s America and can be just as harmful.</p>

Rich Communication Services (RCS) is an alternative to SMS and MMS that is more secure, versatile, and feature-rich than those older messaging standards. However, when iPhone users message each other, they often use iMessage instead of SMS or MMS. That's why Google famously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-eu-companies-letter-to-regulators">paid for ad spots against Apple</a>, trying to convince the company to add RCS to the iPhone and improve the quality of communication between iOS and Android users.</p><p>With iOS 18, Apple added RCS support to the iPhone. So, Google won, right? Well, no — Apple's newfound support for RCS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">had nothing to do with Google</a>. Someone should tell Google that, though, because it just published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-switching-updates/" target="_blank">blog post</a> listing "the top four updates we’ve made to make the switch even easier." Bizarrely, the company touts Apple's support of RCS as something that it did to make switching between iOS and Android easier.</p><p>It's true — even longtime iPhone users now find that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">it's easier to switch from iOS to Android than ever</a>. I'm sure RCS is part of the reason for this. However, as we've pointed out in the past, it's likely that Apple moved to add RCS to iOS to appease regulators rather than to give Google what it wants. The European Union backed off designating iMessage a core platform service around the time Apple announced plans for RCS. More importantly, China requires all phones sold with 5G to support RCS, and that's likely why Apple added it.</p><p>Despite whatever Google believes, it wasn't involved in Apple's decision to support RCS. I'm still skeptical that RCS is even as big of a deal in the grand scheme of the iOS versus Android battle as Google thinks it is.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-right-and-wrong-about-rcs-on-iphone-and-how-it-affects-android-2">Google is right (and wrong) about RCS on iPhone — and how it affects Android</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfD6Q5pxGMKDQxCieNMHP6" name="everything-ios-18-stole-from-android.png" alt="iOS 18 Lock Screen on iPhone 15 Pro Max and Android 15 logo on Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfD6Q5pxGMKDQxCieNMHP6.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I put my main SIM in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> shortly before iOS was publicly released and instantly noticed a few of my chats with tech enthusiast friends switched to RCS. Photos and videos could be sent in higher resolution, text message read receipts and reactions worked as normal, and group chats were much improved. Expectedly, almost all my frustrations with SMS and MMS messaging with iPhone users were resolved.</p><p>While I take exception with Google claiming responsibility for RCS messaging coming to the iPhone, I agree with the company's general point. RCS improves the experience of texting between platforms, and it's a shift I've experienced firsthand. However, the effect it has on consumer behavior and the market is limited to whether iOS users adopt it. First, they need to upgrade to iOS 18. Then, they need to keep the toggle for RCS flipped on and not turn it off manually to spite their Android friends. There's also the matter of certain carriers not supporting RCS on iOS.</p><p>The first issue is the one I'm most concerned about. Historically, the adoption rate of iOS upgrades is higher than that of Android upgrades. That has slowed down in recent years, though. Anecdotally, almost none of my family and friends outside the tech circle have upgraded to iOS 18. I probably won't get to text my parents with RCS unless I take their phones and literally upgrade them to iOS 18 myself.</p><p>The limited data we have about iOS 18 adoption suggests my situation isn't outside the norm. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/ios-version-market-share/" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> data from October 2024, less than 20% of iPhones are running iOS 18. If that number is accurate — and it's worth noting Statcounter figures are estimates — that means there's a <em>maximum</em> of one-fifth of iPhone users in the wild with RCS. Comparatively, more than 50% of iPhone users are on a version of iOS 17 as of last month.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/10/31/apple-aapl-q4-earnings-report-2024.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that "users are adopting iOS 18.1 at twice the rate that they adopted 17.1 in the year-ago quarter." That's the only official word we have from Apple in terms of iOS 18 adoption rates, but even that statement is vague. We don't know if Cook is simply referring to people upgrading from iOS 18 to iOS 18.1, or lumping in the people who have jumped from older iOS versions straight to iOS 18.1.</p><p>The bottom line is that not all iPhones use RCS today. In fact, it's fair to guess that relatively few iPhones are running iOS 18, and thus RCS adoption is probably low. It'll take a while for RCS to become mainstream on iOS, and until that happens, it won't have a meaningful impact on the iPhone and Android battle.</p>

<p>Put aside Google's dubious claim to RCS support on iPhone, and it has a few solid reasons for stating that it's much easier to switch between platforms. Android Switch is now available on a few brands, which allows users to transfer everything from chats and contacts to Wi-Fi logins to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new Android phone</a>. Additionally, the company notes that it's 40% faster to transfer data between iOS and Android using a cable.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google also shares that you can set up the </a>Google Pixel 9 without transferring data to try out the smartphone and transfer data later if you like it. Additionally, express setup makes it easier to move from one Android phone to another.</p><p>RCS didn't magically make it easier to switch to Android overnight, and Google isn't responsible for Apple adding it to new iPhones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. However, it is easier than ever to do it, and Android hardware is at its best. There are plenty of phones from Google, Samsung, and OnePlus that could entice iPhone users to cross the walled garden.</p>
<p>As a longtime user of both iOS and Android, I can safely say that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> is the phone that'll feel most like an iPhone. It has a ton of polish and excellent software features — in some ways, Google AI is better than Apple Intelligence. The reason I first left iPhone nearly half a decade ago was to try a foldable, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is a great option for people who want to do the same.</p><p>OnePlus and Samsung are gearing up to launch new flagships in the U.S., so maybe you wanna hold off on buying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 series</a> now. However, Black Friday and Cyber Monday are approaching fast, and it's worth keeping an eye out for a worthy deal on those models. In fact, we've already rounded up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/planning-a-phone-upgrade-this-black-friday-these-are-my-picks">the best phones to upgrade to this Black Friday</a>.</p><p>To sum up, it's indeed a good time to move to Android. The platform is heading in the right direction, and it's getting easier to switch between iOS and Android. But Google really needs to let the RCS issue go. Its obsession with Apple and RCS is one of many things the company does that makes iPhone users cringe.</p>

The Pro model sports a 6.78-inch OLED display and a 5910mAh battery.</p><p>Furthermore, the Find X8 has three 50MP cameras while the Find X8 Pro has four, with an additional periscope telephoto lens for 6x optical zoom.</p><p>Both phones are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">MediaTek Dimensity 9400</a>, which competes directly with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> and offers a new NPU with 80% faster LLM prompts and 100% more performant diffusion generation. You get a choice of 12 or 16GB of RAM with the X8, while the X8 Pro is only offered with 16GB. There's also support for magnetic charging, but you'll need a separate case for that.</p><p>For our impressions on OPPO's latest flagship, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">OPPO Find X8 Pro review</a>.</p>

However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-laptop-development.html">one rumor</a> points to what could be a Pixel Laptop, and it may not run ChromeOS as we would expect. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-os-becoming-android-3500661/">Mishaal Rahman</a>, Google is working on a "multi-year project to fully turn Chrome OS into Android."</p><p>Google already seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chromeos-is-undergoing-major-changes-and-lacros-is-the-first-casualty">laying down the groundwork</a> to make this happen, as it recently started merging "portions of the Android stack, like the Android Linux kernel and Android frameworks, as part of the foundation of ChromeOS." This is apparently being done to accelerate development, particularly with AI features. Still, that won't be ready for "quite some time."</p><p>As for the Pixel Laptop, it seems it may be a high-end Android device that is meant to compete more with the likes of the iPad. Only time will tell if the rumors of a laptop are true and whether it will indeed be able to adequately compete.</p>

A Reddit post seems to show what's allegedly the Garmin Instinct 3, with what looks like an MIP two-window display. There's also an indicator under the display noting that it's a solar watch, which can help extend the battery life thanks to the built-in solar panel overlay.</p><p>The design resembles a somewhat sleeker Instinct Crossover, but the image clearly shows "Garmin Instinct 3" on the bottom. For now, it's unclear if the image is really the Garmin Instinct 3, but it wouldn't be the first time the watch has been spotted, so we'll see. It may not appeal to many athletes like other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> do, but the rugged design and solar capability may appeal to the more outdoorsy types.</p>

I got back to using its products recently, and I can see why the brand outsells its rivals — the 737 power Bank in particular is one of the best you can get today, with the power bank offering three ports and a massive 24,000mAh battery.</p><p>The power bank debuted for $149 last year, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z">now on sale for just $79</a>, its lowest price yet. Pricing data for 2024 shows that it went down to $109 in sporadic bursts this year, but the Black Friday deal on this power bank makes it an instant recommendation if you&apos;re looking to pick one up.</p>

<p>Anker makes the best power banks, and this model is its best yet. It has dual USB-C ports and a USB-A port, has a built-in screen that shows real-time charging stats, and goes up to 140W over USB PD 3.1 via the USB-C ports. I test dozens of power banks over the course of the year, and the 737 is the one you should get — particularly now that it's just $79.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="221bce3d-e466-444d-9fad-254e91bda332" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$79 at Amazon" data-dimension48="$79 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>There&apos;s plenty to like with the 737 Power Bank. The 24,000mAh battery is big enough to charge all your tech — including a notebook and two phones — without any issues. There are dual USB-C ports based on the USB PD 3.1 standard, and each port goes up to 140W, making it a great choice to charge MacBooks and other notebooks. What&apos;s also great is that the internal battery also charges at 140W — provided you use a charger that goes up to 140W (I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Charger-GaNPrime-Compact-Foldable/dp/B09W2PNLX7">recommend this one</a>).</p><p>I also like that there&apos;s an LCD panel that shows real-time charging details. This is particularly handy if you&apos;re on the go and need to see how long it will take to charge your device. There&apos;s a USB-A port as well, and you can easily charge three devices at once, with 18W going to USB-A, and 122W split amongst the two USB-C ports.</p><p>You get a 140W USB-C to USB-C cable bundled in the package, and the design of the power bank makes it easy to throw in a bag or use at your desk. There isn&apos;t anything missing here, and given what you&apos;re getting, the 737 Power Bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Portable-Charger-Compatible/dp/B09VPHVT2Z">is a steal at $79</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Pixel phones feature an At a Glance widget that smartly shows the information you need, when you need it.</li><li>Google appears to be working on a new At a Glance mode that will show live sports scores on your home screen.</li><li>This functionality could give Pixels a competing feature to the iPhone's Dynamic Island, which can already be used to show live sports scores.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The <strong>At a Glance</strong> widget is a staple of Google Pixel home screens, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-launcher-default-search-engine-picker-spotted">even if it's now removable</a>. That's because it's a fairly unobtrusive, but useful widget. It smartly switches what information is displayed on your screen based on your habits, the time of day, and the status of your smart home devices. However, the At a Glance home screen widget could be gaining the ability to show sports scores, according to an APK teardown from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/22/pixel-at-a-glance-sports/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The folks over at 9to5Google unpacked version 13 of Android System Intelligence, the app that handles a ton of your phone's smart features, including At a Glance. In it, the team found a handful of code strings indicating that the widget could one day "show sports updates" on Pixel home and lock screens. Here's the full section of  code relating to sports cores in At a Glance:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name=”echo_smartspace_pref_sports_key”>gemini_space_sports_score</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_subtitle”>Show sports updates from %1$s. These might affect battery life.</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_title”>Sports</string> 
<string name=”echo_smartspace_sports_toggle_subtitle_provider_name”>Google</string></code></pre>
<p>As spotted by 9to5Google, the code strings reference <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> rather than Google Assistant. This could be a precursor to Google shifting the At a Glance widget to become part of the Gemini suite. It wouldn't exactly be a surprise, since Google is clearly shifting away from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> and toward Gemini. Additionally, it's possible that Gemini could factor in some other way, like providing summaries of big plays or game recaps.</p><p>The potential addition of sports scores to the Add a Glance widget could be a big win for Android, and more specifically, Pixel. Apple has been pushing into the sports industry aggressively of late, buying the media rights to Major League Soccer games, debuting an Apple Sports app, and showing live scores through the Dynamic Island on iPhone. By including sports scores in At a Glance, Google could help Pixels become one step closer to matching the iPhone's live sports capabilities.</p><p>However, it's important to note that this feature is clearly still in development and may never ship. If it does debut on Pixel phones, it could be a top feature for sports fans.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a minor update to Android 15 Beta testers, Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, ahead of the update's expected public release next month.</li><li>Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 includes bug fixes and other improvements, and is available for Google Pixel 6 and newer devices, including Pixel Tablet.</li><li>The update comes as most beta testers have already moved to Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is sending a minor update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta testers as it gears up to release Android 15 QPR1 publicly next month. The update, Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> today in a Reddit post. It includes bug fixes and improves overall stability, and is available for Google Pixel 6 and newer phones, plus the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>.</p><p>For users enrolled in the Android Beta Program, the update will be sent automatically over-the-air. The build number for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 is <strong>AP41.240925.012</strong>. However, Google notes that users will only get this update if they're enrolled in the beta program and are still running Android 15 QPR1. Those that have updated to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr2-beta-1-pixel-test-start">Android 15 QPR2 Beta 1</a>, or manually flashed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Developer Preview 1</a>, won't need Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1gxhqu3/android_15_qpr1_beta_31_now_available">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are no known new features or major changes in Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, and that's not surprising, as beta testers are already looking ahead to Android 15 QPR2. However, there are a few bug fixes that will be appreciated by anyone still on Android 15 QPR1. That includes a fix for NFC payment failures, a problem that has plagued various pre-release versions of Android 15 for months.</p><p>Here are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/release-notes-qpr1" target="_blank">full release notes</a> for Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3.1, provided by Google:</p>
<ul><li>Fixed an issue where tapping media controls closed the notification shade but didn't open the app. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/375447625">Issue #375447625</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where long pressing the device entry icon didn't work when there were many notifications and the notification shelf was overlapping the lock icon. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/369316295">Issue #369316295</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that prevented proper volume control for some Bluetooth devices. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/376650439">Issue #376650439</a>,<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/373681731">Issue #373681731</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the Material You, wallpaper-derived color options to be very similar. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378507373">Issue #378507373</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that caused the scrollbar in the system settings to be sized and styled inconsistently. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/366278155">Issue #366278155</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue that sometimes caused NFC payments to fail. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/363914347">Issue #363914347</a>)</li><li>Fixed an issue where translations in Indonesian and Hebrew didn't display correctly for apps that are targeting Android 14 (API level 34) or lower. (<a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/378200084">Issue #378200084</a>)</li><li>Fixed various other issues that were impacting system stability, camera, connectivity, localization, accessibility, and interactivity.</li></ul>
<p>This appears to be simply a quick tune-up for Android 15 QPR1 as Google prepares to release it publicly. It's largely the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-bluetooth-foldable-update">Android 15 QPR1 Beta 3</a>, plus the bug fixes, which was the last QPR1 beta release that hit testers nearly a month ago.</p>

<p>Outside of fitness trackers, you'll also find some Black Friday Fitbit deals on its smartwatches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Fitness-Smartwatch-Included/dp/B0B4MV1TGL"><strong>Fitbit Sense 2 is $179.95 ($70 off)</strong></a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B4MWCFV4"><strong>Fitbit Versa 4 is $119.95 ($80 off)</strong></a>. Both watches have technically fallen lower <em>once</em> in their deal history — the Versa 4 at $104 and the Sense 2 at $139 — but they're both at the <em>second-lowest</em> price we've ever seen.</p><p>Because Google has all but confirmed that it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-great-running-features-overshadowed-by-fitbit-watches-demise">won't make any more Fitbit-branded watches</a>, focusing on the expensive, short-lived, and Android-only Pixel Watches, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 are the best you're going to get, as long as they remain in stock. But despite its age, the Sense 2 remains an excellent option for health tracking paired with a gorgeous AMOLED display, while the Versa 4 is more stripped down but very affordable at this price.</p>
