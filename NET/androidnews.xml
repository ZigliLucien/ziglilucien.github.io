As part of the move, Google Preferred Care and Fi Device Protection subscribers are being migrated to Pixel Care Plus.</p><p>Whether you're a new or old subscriber, you may be wondering what exactly you get by paying for Pixel Care Plus, and how it's different from older Google protection plans. This guide will cover everything you need to know, from pricing and availability to benefits and how to cancel.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-is-pixel-care-plus"><span>What is Pixel Care Plus?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DvQLwi6FGcrwsYGLTuUs6i" name="Pixel-Care-Plus-3" alt="A repair facilitated by Google Pixel Care Plus." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DvQLwi6FGcrwsYGLTuUs6i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixel Care Plus is a device protection plan for Google hardware products, specifically certain Pixel and Fitbit models. It works like any other insurance plan, providing peace of mind in the event your phone, tablet, or watch needs an expensive repair. Pixel Care Plus covers accidental damage, but also extends the hardware warranty of your device.</p><p>A unique benefit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-launches-pixel-care-program-free-screen-repairs-pixel-10-and-more">Pixel Care Plus</a> is no-deductible screen and battery repairs. However, all other repairs not covered under the extended warranty or screen and battery inclusions will incur a service fee ranging from $49 to $99, depending on the device model.</p><p>Pixel Care Plus is available as an upfront purchase or as a monthly subscription, and can be cancelled at any time. You can buy it with the purchase of a new Pixel or Fitbit device, or add it within 60 days of your purchase in the Google Store or My Pixel apps.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-devices-are-eligible-for-pixel-care-plus"><span>What devices are eligible for Pixel Care Plus?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-and-10-pro-with-boxes" alt="A jade Google Pixel 10 Pro and a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with their respective boxes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfTF9ZDCe3w4vU2zJiRxoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pixel Care Plus is available for a slew of Google hardware products spanning the Pixel and Fitbit lines.

Beyond that, other types of accidental damage require a service fee for replacement, but there are other Pixel Care Plus perks. Namely, there's unlimited damage coverage. Most competing plans, like AppleCare Plus and Samsung Care, only let you claim a certain number of repairs or replacements in a given time period.</p><p>Additionally, the device protection plan offers priority support and next-day shipping for replacements. You can also get your device serviced at a Google Store or a certified repair shop, including Asurion's uBreakiFix locations. Google says there are over 700 authorized repair locations that can service your Pixel or Fitbit device in a pinch with Pixel Care Plus.</p><p>Depending on your device, Pixel Care Plus may come at a higher cost than other device protection plans, but it does come with key perks like free screen and battery replacements. You can add coverage to your eligible Pixel or Fitbit device within 60 days of your purchase, even if it wasn't bought directly from Google, so you have some time to decide whether it's right for you.</p><p>You can cancel Pixel Care Plus at any time by signing into the Google Store with your Google account, opening the Pixel Care Plus account hub, selecting your device, and following the prompts to proceed with the cancellation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="18f3a6f9-79cf-4ec5-8830-4963bc4f5042">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Pixel yet</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 series ushered in a ton of improvements, including the Pixel Care Plus protection plan for the first time.

It mitigates some key complaints I had with the first Suunto Race, with absurdly good battery life and a training feature that I wish my Garmin Forerunners had.</p><p>When I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-review">Suunto Race</a> last year, I said it was "near the finish line" as a solid mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watch</a>, but the HR results were mediocre, and the GPS data had odd issues with zig-zagging data that added extra distance to every mile.</p><p>I've taken the Suunto Race 2 out enough to know that its battery life isn't a facade, the accuracy has improved significantly, and the ZoneSense tool fixes a complaint I've had with Garmin's training load data for some time.

Even if you get the $599 titanium version I'm testing, it still doesn't feel overpriced.</p><p>The Race 2 isn't nearly as well-rounded as the Forerunner 570, to be fair. You don't get a mic, speaker, flashlight, ECGs, music storage, or contactless payments, and Garmin offers native workout plans while Suunto relies on TrainingPeaks.</p><p>Garmin will always beat its fitness watch rivals for software smarts, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">charges a premium for better hardware</a>, and not every athlete is willing to pay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a> prices for great battery life.</p><p>Maybe you need a watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, with extra benefits like workout suggestions <em>and</em> better battery life.

It helps runners balance their training, but I find it frustrating how they lump each run's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> into one category.</p><p>For example, if I spend five miles in low aerobic, then two miles at an anaerobic sprint, the overall HR average will categorize it as high aerobic, which isn't accurate.</p><p>I want granular data on how long I've spent in different zones and what that means for my fitness. So I went into the SuuntoPlus app store and downloaded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.suunto.com/pages/suunto-zonesense">ZoneSense</a> to do just that. Unfortunately, I didn't realize this tool needed a chest strap for HRV insights that the Race 2's optical sensor can't deliver.</p><p>I'll test ZoneSense properly for the review once my health is in the clear, but the <em>concept</em> is what I'm looking for, so I know when I typically switch to anaerobic at race pace. Or I can intentionally up my intensity after X minutes of low-aerobic endurance building.</p><p>I do wish ZoneSense didn't <em>need </em>a chest strap, but I find it very cool that Suunto has a SuuntoPlus app store full of unique integrations and alternative training tools like this. It makes the Race 2 feel less insular than other fitness watches.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="0f41a97d-6505-40df-94fe-aef1f1458bbb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RF2V9SJV2tNLCQ6dWWvC2A.png' alt="Render of the Suunto Race 2 running watch"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Never quits</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Suunto Race 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Suunto Race 2 has a 1.5-inch, 2,000-nit LTPO OLED display, 16-day battery life, 10ATM water resistance, and either a steel or titanium case for rugged durability.

It all started when Nintendo itself took down two of the most popular emulators in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a>. Since then, there have been quite a few different forks crop up in an effort to fill the void.</p><p>None of those, not even Yuzu or Ryujinx, were ever released onto the Play Store, until now. Eden, a Switch emulator forked from Yuzu, has apparently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.eden.eden_emulator&hl=en_US">been on the Play Store</a> since at least August 19. Somehow, it managed to fly under the radar until the someone over on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EmulationOnAndroid/comments/1nfam26/eden_now_on_play_store/">r/EmulationOnAndroid subreddit</a> spotted it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3218px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UAVgh2Y4mCmzGoHvwSRXQE" name="eden-emulator-google-play-store-listing" alt="Screenshot of the Eden Emulator Google Play Store listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UAVgh2Y4mCmzGoHvwSRXQE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3218" height="1810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google Play)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly enough, it seems that the most recent update is based on v0.0.3-rc3, which was released on August 20. Just last week, the Eden team released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/eden-emulator/Releases/releases/tag/v0.0.3">stable build of v0.0.3</a>, but this has yet to make its way to the Play Store.</p><p>As for the listing itself, in order to run Eden on your Android device, it'll need to at least be updated to Android 11, and that's just to even install the emulator. Beyond that, you'll need to provide your own "prod" keys and firmware, in addition to actually having the necessary ROM files to play. That in and of itself is a rabbit hole that we can't really help with.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn" name="ayn-odin-3-product-lifestyle-4" alt="AYN Odin 3 product lifestyle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iuKk9HYGFUJxzWkHBqjUn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYN)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, Eden's arrival on the Play Store comes at a rather interesting time. Both AYN and AYANEO have introduced an array of Android-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handhelds</a>. It started with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">Pocket DS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayn-thor-pre-orders-open-tonight-and-its-much-cheaper-than-i-thought">Thor</a>, swiftly followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayn-odin-3-is-the-first-snapdragon-8-elite-handheld-starting-at-just-usd299">Odin 3</a> and KONKR Pocket FIT.</p><p>The Pocket DS and Thor are dual-screen handhelds, aiming to capture the magic that once was the Nintendo DS and 3DS (minus the 3D screen). As for the Odin 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-puts-retroid-and-anbernic-on-notice-with-its-upcoming-konkr-pocket-fit">Pocket FIT</a>, these are the first two handhelds to be announced powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JTmjnzutjLWWnACEdZkyzV" name="ayaneo-konkr-pocket-fit-colors-lifestyle-render" alt="AYANEO KONKR Pocket FIT lifestyle render showing three of the four color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JTmjnzutjLWWnACEdZkyzV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If that wasn't exciting enough, both of these upcoming handhelds are the cheapest devices to feature the 8 Elite. Pre-orders for the Odin 3 Base start at $330 and will go up to $360 upon release. Meanwhile, the Pocket FIT comes in at $269 during pre-orders, and will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-fit-premier-hi-performance-android-handheld">priced at $329</a> at launch. The only downside to either of these is that AYN isn't expecting to begin shipping the Odin 3 until November, while the Pocket FIT likely won't arrive until December.</p><p>Even still, it's wild to think that we'll have not one, but two Snapdragon 8 Elite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> before the end of 2025. And provided that the Eden team can manage to avoid the ire of Nintendo, you can just download a Switch emulator right from the Play Store. Although, if last year is anything to go by, I suspect this won't be the case for too much longer.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="808080cd-e3ac-4256-a05b-a293d0ba30f6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension48="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FoBLWSVAoVvRPbeqax6eVC" name="ayn-odin-3-black-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FoBLWSVAoVvRPbeqax6eVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>AYN Odin 3: </strong><a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/odin-3-the-ultimate-6-120hz-oled-gaming-handheld/" data-dimension112="808080cd-e3ac-4256-a05b-a293d0ba30f6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension48="AYN Odin 3: From $330 at Indiegogo" data-dimension25=""><strong>From $330 at Indiegogo</strong></a></p><p>The AYN Odin 3 has been two years in the making, as it's the proper successor to the Odin 2 from 2023.

The entire chassis is now one piece, with a single glass insert slotting into the back to facilitate wireless charging.</p><p>This new iPhone 17 Pro Max build is designed to enhance the smartphone's strength and reduce its temperature, addressing a few drawbacks of the prior models' titanium material. It's still IP68-certified, but now features Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the front with an anti-reflective coating. This takes clear inspiration from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which added a game-changing anti-glare screen earlier this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a design standpoint, both the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra have 6.9-inch screens, but the latter has a flatter and thinner body. The Galaxy S25 Ultra measures just 8.2mm thick, while the iPhone is 8.75mm thick. Apple's smartphone is also 15 grams heavier, so in terms of form factor, the Galaxy S25 Ultra may feel better in the hand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo" name="top-down-s-pen-settings-multiple-s-pens-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of the S Pen settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by different types of S Pens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have OLED displays with 120Hz LTPO variable refresh rate support. Apple's phone is slightly brighter, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max capable of reaching 3,000 nits peak in outdoor settings. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra tops out at 2,600 nits, which will still be plenty bright.</p><p>Notably, the Galaxy S25 Ultra packs an S Pen inside, and you can use the stylus for quick drawings or note-taking. There are even a few Galaxy AI features that leverage the S Pen for ease of use, like Sketch to Image. Put simply, the iPhone 17 Pro Max has no equivalent, either on the first or third-party market.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-pro-max-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone 17 Pro Max vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm" name="iPhone-17-Pro-2" alt="The iPhone 17 Pro Max in press renders showing the unibody design and camera features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jLq4jqYrHvT5BECMjFwxhm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">Apple A19 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> chipsets are the two most powerful mobile processors on the market, and they're inside the iPhone 17 Pro Max and the Galaxy S25 Ultra, respectively. Both phones utilize vapor chambers to cool these blazing-fast chips and feature optimizations that balance performance and efficiency. They each feature 12GB of memory by default, but only the Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 16GB RAM option tied to the 1TB storage configuration.</p><p>While both handsets start with 256GB of storage, the iPhone 17 Pro Max introduces a 2TB storage configuration for the first time. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra can only be equipped with up to 1TB of storage.

Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Ultra only supports Bluetooth 5.4. Samsung has the edge in biometrics, offering an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor and facial recognition.</p><p>Battery life and charging are starting to tip in favor of the iPhone for the first time. The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a 5,088mAh battery capacity, slightly higher than the 5,000mAh cell inside the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It can also charge up to 50% in only 20 minutes.

However, the telephoto camera is an upgrade in one way and a downgrade in another. It's a 48MP lens with 4x optical zoom, but that becomes 8x optical-quality zoom with sensor cropping down to 12MP photos. Last year's iPhone 16 Pro Max could do 5x optical zoom, but didn't have the sensor-cropping capabilities of the new higher-megapixel sensor.</p><p>Otherwise, the 48MP primary sensor can shoot 24MP and 12MP photos, with the 48MP ultrawide adding a 120-degree field-of-view to get more in the shot. Apple added a new 18MP front-facing camera sensor to the entire iPhone 17 lineup, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">it's a square sensor rather than a typical 4:3 sensor</a>.

Apple seems to be copying Google's homework a bit, because the new iPhone 17 Pro Max has what it's calling a camera "plateau." It might sound a bit silly, and some think it <em>looks</em> silly, but it's part of an impressive iPhone 17 Pro Max design shift to a unibody construction.</p><p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max is crafted out of one piece of aluminum that holds all the components with a small cutout on the back for a slab of glass. It creates something of a two-tone look for the iPhone — also reminiscent of older Pixels — that makes wireless charging transmission remain possible. The design change improves durability and thermals, as aluminum is better at dissipating heat than titanium, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max has a vapor chamber for the first time.</p><p>It's worth noting that Google has been using polished aluminum for a while on Pixel Pro phones, and had vapor chambers for cooling before Apple.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-12" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red brick stairs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yye5RmHydEBEjZJWk8n4uU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tend to be critical of big and heavy phones, and the iPhone 17 Pro Max actually makes the Pixel 10 Pro XL feel small in this regard. Apple's phone is 8.75mm thick (which doesn't even take the camera plateau into account) and weighs 233 grams.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is thinner at 8.5mm and lighter at 232 grams. Those figures don't include the camera bump either, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is still thinner and lighter than the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Maybe that matters to you, maybe it doesn't.</p><p>Both phones have impressive durability features. The iPhone 17 Pro Max and Pixel 10 Pro XL are both IP68-certified against dust and water ingress, and each has durable glass — Ceramic Shield 2 and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, respectively.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-camera-viewfinder-05" alt="Using a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to take a photo of red flowers up close" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FsL3kFtGCYXCS7PahjVswD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 Pro Max has a larger display, measuring 6.9 inches.

If you like the Apple ecosystem, go with the iPhone; if you want tons of on-device AI, grab the Pixel. Either way, you're going to end up with an excellent phone that will last you into the next decade.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f551b691-c82b-4c7d-b300-6baa3f43600a">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17-pro/" data-model-name="iPhone 17 Pro Max" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egnTiinBmNpHDkPPfnMf5C.jpg' alt="The iPhone 17 Pro in Cosmic Orange in a white product render."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17 Pro Max</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The one for speed</strong></em></p><p>If you want raw power and excellent industrial design, the iPhone 17 Pro Max is the clear winner.

And while that's great for breaking down messaging walled gardens, there's also the reality that NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content continues to spread, and that isn't ideal for some.</p><p>Thankfully, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-finally-shields-you-from-surprise-nudes">built in sensitive content warnings</a> for Messages. If you receive, send, or forward images containing nudity (intentionally or not), your Android phone can automatically detect and blur them. If you'd like to enable this feature on your device, or even on your child's phone, there's an easy way to do it and protect yourself from embarrassment while staying safe.</p><h2 id="what-are-sensitive-content-warnings-in-google-messages-and-how-do-they-work-2">What are sensitive content warnings in Google Messages and how do they work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg" name="Google-Messages-lifestyle-widescreen.jpg" alt="Google Messages RCS Chat features on a Pixel 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fyQgKdrsP97Hqn6oF2RoHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite advanced privacy and safety tools in place, the amount of indecent exposure has only increased. What sensitive content warnings in Google Messages do is add an extra layer of safety by blurring images so you don't accidentally open them in public, or so you can better protect your child from harmful content.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/15724426?hl=en">says</a> sensitive content warnings in Messages use the company's SafetyCore system service to classify if an image warrants a safety warning. Importantly, all of the processing happens on-device, and the data never leaves your smartphone.</p><p>So what happens when your phone detects sensitive content? When a user receives a nude image with the feature enabled, tapping it triggers what Google calls "speed bumps" to make sure they know what they’re about to see.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2508px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="qmjZ9Buznno9fFnNqySv5V" name="Google-messages-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google Messages on Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qmjZ9Buznno9fFnNqySv5V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2508" height="1411" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it shows a warning about the image and an option that leads to a page explaining why such images are harmful. Google Messages also presents direct options like blocking the number.</p><p>As a final step, another pop-up asks if you'd still like to open the image.</p><p>The feature also works when sending. If a user with sensitive content warnings enabled tries to send a nude image, they must swipe and tap “yes”, ensuring they’re certain about what they’re sending.</p><p>It's worth noting that the sensitive content warning feature currently applies only to images and does not work with other media types such as videos and GIFs.</p><h2 id="how-to-enable-sensitive-content-warnings-in-google-messages-2">How to enable sensitive content warnings in Google Messages</h2><p>Given the importance of this feature, especially for children, Google enables sensitive content warnings on smartphones based on the user's age. For kids under 13, the feature is automatically enabled and cannot be turned off.</p><p>For teens between 13 and 17, it's also enabled by default but can be disabled in Google Messages settings. For users over 18, the feature is disabled by default. Thankfully, you can easily enable it on your phone. Here's how to enable it on your device:</p><p>1. Open the Google Messages app on your device.</p><p>2. Tap on your <strong>profile icon</strong> at the top right corner.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Messages settings</strong>.</p><p>4. Scroll down and choose <strong>Protection and safety</strong>.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Manage sensitive content warnings</strong> and toggle it on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4370px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.61%;"><img id="KjD2HFNMGT2mchTJTFHdVc" name="google-messages-sensitive-cw-how-to" alt="Sensitive content warnings in Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KjD2HFNMGT2mchTJTFHdVc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4370" height="2430" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Note</strong>: You might be asked to install SafetyCore services on your Android phone before toggling the feature in Step 5. Just tap the Install SafetyCore button, and once installed, you can enable these warnings.</p><h2 id="smarter-protection-built-into-google-messages-2">Smarter protection built into Google Messages</h2><p>Over the last few months, Google has added several security and privacy features to Android, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft tools</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-will-soon-watermark-magic-editor-creations-with-synthid">marking AI-made images</a> in Google Photos, but this is simply one of the best features Google has added in a while. It not only protects children using a phone from indecent exposure but also spares adults from potential public embarrassment.</p><p>While Google notes the feature works offline on the device, it does require users to be signed into their Google account, likely for age-based restrictions.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="15de695c-7d61-451d-92fd-9f4cf38ca1c5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Obsidian"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>AI-powered safety</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro is the most complete flagship from the brand in years.

I've never owned an iPhone, and my last experience using one was probably the iPhone 6, but Apple's latest phones are admittedly pretty enticing, even as a long-time Android user.</p><p>Given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-should-release-another-ipod-touch">Apple's unfortunate disinterest in developing another iPod Touch</a>, I've gone back and forth about buying an iPhone, and each year, I feel like the temptation becomes stronger. With the iPhone 17 series, I feel like it's come to a head, and now all that's left is to decide which model would be best for me and look at how they compare to their Android counterparts.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-iphone-17-a-welcome-step-up"><span>The iPhone 17: A welcome step-up</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To me, the base iPhone always felt like the poor man's iPhone, as it made quite a few compromises to keep the price down, especially when you put it next to comparable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. However, Apple seems to have gotten the memo, bringing plenty of notable upgrades that finally make the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-17/"><strong>iPhone 17</strong></a> worth looking at.</p><p>For starters, it has a 120Hz OLED display, up from the 60Hz panel on previous models.  It's shocking Apple waited this long to bring it to an $800 phone. It also features a 1-120Hz refresh rate, which surpasses the Pixel 10's 60-120Hz display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1855px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cKayuas8XM26sBrJ49TUvQ" name="iPhone-17-cameras" alt="The iPhone 17 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKayuas8XM26sBrJ49TUvQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1855" height="1043" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Faster charging means it reaches 50% in just 20 minutes, plus Qi2 25W MagSafe charging is something you'll only find on the higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.

The iPhone 17 Pro has a fairly unique look with a bit of glass on the back encased by aluminum.

It's probably the best-looking iPhone I've seen in a long time, sporting a new design that's reminiscent of a Nexus 6P. As Apple's thinnest phone, there's no doubt it's a technological marvel, but there are some compromises to deal with if you're going to pick this $999 phone over competing phones (and even the iPhone 17 Pro).</p><p>Most notably, there's only one camera, which likely takes great photos, but it lacks flexibility. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is nearly as thin, features a secondary ultrawide camera, which can be handy.

It features the same hardware as last year’s Pixel 9 Pro, but one key addition is the new 100x zoom. Although this is less useful for product photography, I’ve seen improvements across the entire zoom range, which proves far more useful, especially at 2x.</p><p>Like most smartphone cameras, the Pixel 10 Pro uses in-sensor cropping to achieve a 2x ‘optical-quality’ zoom. One thing I’ve found while searching for the best phone camera for work is that 2x, not 1x, is the best mode for shooting product photos. This is largely because the narrower focal length provides a tight crop, but this also offers a shallower depth of field, enabling the product to stand out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-camera-viewfinder-exposure-app-2" alt="Exposure settings in the Pixel 10 Pro camera app viewfinder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2024" height="1139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro also has one additional feature that makes it truly fantastic for work photos: RAW photography.

The latter is key, especially when capturing photos in a wide variety of lighting conditions, and Google is the only phone maker to offer easy access to this in the viewfinder.</p><p>I understand white balance and how to effectively deploy it, especially to highlight certain features on a phone, but I usually edit this after capturing the photo. This on-screen toggle allows me to do it while capturing the image, and provides far more creative license to capture unique and visually interesting product photos.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel 10 Pro doesn't have the biggest camera sensor, but it does have the best all-around professional smartphone camera.

The easy explanation is that Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">a free version</a> you can do anything with, and a non-free, but not paid version that has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">some strings attached</a> if you want to use it. But it's a little more nuanced than that.</p><p>Google gets (rightfully) accused of having a heavy hand sometimes, but the actual requirements to use the "official" version of Android are pretty lax. Mostly, you need to make sure that all the apps in Google Play designed for your version of Android work. Yes, I know that's not the case and plenty are broken, but that is what these rules are designed to do.</p><p>Google can fix this pretty easily, but I'll tell you that none of us wants that to happen. Google tries to exercise control over Android, but in reality, it's kind of a free-for-all where companies making products do anything they can to differentiate themselves. Big companies, like Samsung, can do a much better (or worse, depending on your point of view) job of it.</p><h2 id="how-android-became-the-thing-2">How Android became "the" thing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3955px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UgZSrUeePuYDLmBCNdZVHW" name="Google-logo.jpg" alt="The Google logo on a building" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UgZSrUeePuYDLmBCNdZVHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3955" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The very reason that this can happen is what made Android what it is in the first place. Letting companies like Samsung or Motorola mostly do their own thing meant they could appease carriers and sell a ton of phones. When you sell a ton of phones, you can make more, and once most phones that are sold use Android, Google is in a unique position.</p><p>This has lessened a bit, and many phones are made without much carrier involvement outside of network compatibility, but you'll still find companies making special phones for carriers. Phone makers no longer need to do it, so they are trying to stand out by being unique. We get things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> as a result, so I'm not complaining.</p><p>That's a good thing, but it can be a terrible thing that leads to brand-new watches not working with brand-new phones and two companies unable to fix it. By unable, I actually mean unable, not unwilling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-8" alt="The main app view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google wants your new Pixel 10 to work with your new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.

If your phone has to meet certain minimum requirements, you might not be able to sell it at an affordable price. If every phone costs $1,000, a lot of people would stop buying a new one every year.

The company is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-googles-big-court-win-mean-for-us">considered a monopoly</a> by its home country (agreed), and Google is rightfully under a lot of scrutiny because Android is by far the dominant computing platform in the world. It got there by allowing manufacturers some leeway, so Google shouldn't be allowed to try to walk it back.</p><p>Google tries. Samsung tries. I know that they try, and some of the ideas they come up with to alleviate this situation are remarkable, like the aforementioned Play Services app. Yes, they are a bit demanding and controlling, but they are also a compromise that works.</p><p>Now that we've reached "peak smartphone" and are waiting for another moonshot idea to change everything, this will get worse. Samsung will do more of its own thing, as will Google. Some of those things will be good enough to be integrated into Android, but others will create new problems. There are some very smart folks ready to tackle them, though.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f75324ae-c3b1-4d94-a5ed-2983e7d896ca">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QfdvautZ3KdhiWYonQzJj5.jpg' alt="A render of the graphite Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 40mm smartwatch."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>New look, familiar feel</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Galaxy on your wrist</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 hardware hasn't changed much from the Watch 7, but most of the changes are behind the scenes, such as Gemini smarts, health and nutrition tracking, and One UI 8 Watch.

The company is calling this a "significant" upgrade to its already existing automations experience in the Home app. The post states users will be guided through this new automation update when heading into "New Automation" for the first time.</p><p>Users can now create automations in the following ways: based on presence (whether someone's home or everyone is away), the ability to send notifications to specific people or the whole house, and an option to set automations to run on specified days and times.</p><p>The inclusion of more conditions is something Google highlighted quite heavily, stating they "allow you to create automations that only start when certain criteria are met." Moreover, you can have your device automations react to certain things, like the time of day and whether someone's home.</p><p>Joining this automation update is the ability to create "one-time automations." Users have the choice of forgoing a recurring instance for a chance at letting an automation happen only "this Friday." An auto-delete "after this automation finishes" option enters for a bit of hands-free clean up.</p><h2 id="google-home-continues-to-advance-2">Google Home continues to advance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:279px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:215.05%;"><img id="RfkZkHBDvvTdaj4x9Sf7cP" name="google-home-automations-upgrade-example" alt="An example of the editor users will see when creating new automations in the Google Home app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RfkZkHBDvvTdaj4x9Sf7cP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="279" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This exciting update is starting to appear, but Google says not everything is there.

The post adds that some starters and actions from your Personal Routines will also be unavailable for the time being in the upgraded automations editor.</p><p>This week's update marks quite a significant upgrade for Google Home's automations, something the app focused on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-summaries-test-gemini-automation-details">during its Gemini update</a>.

While we felt that the list was not as long as it used to be, we were able to round up five obvious features that Apple "took" from Android.</p><p>For starters, Apple basically followed Samsung's suit in launching a slim "iPhone Air," a phone that's just 5.6mm thin. But Samsung beat Apple to the punch earlier this year when it released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is surprisingly a bit thicker than the iPhone at 5.8mm, but has two cameras.</p><p>The iPhone 17 showed up with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/everyone-is-stealing-the-pixels-best-design-trait-and-im-loving-it">camera bar</a> that has been a staple of Google's Pixel thing, since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a>. Third, Apple stuck to its predecessor's pricing, following Google's footsteps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 lineup.</a> Satellight connectivity is coming to the Watch Ultra 3, which was first brought in by the Fenix 8 Pro, after which Google announced it for the Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>While Apple "stole" some features from Android, it also developed its own unique features, such as the "CenterStage camera," which is quite impressive. This feature utilizes the square camera sensor in a unique way, allowing the camera to crop in to provide portrait or landscape shots without requiring the user to physically rotate their device.</p><p>It also raised the bar to 256GB as a base storage option across the board. Another huge one is BP monitoring on the watch; while this feature is yet to be approved by the FDA, it could be a game-changer for the health industry.</p><h2 id="s-pen-stays-put-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra-2">S Pen stays put on the Galaxy S26 Ultra</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo" name="top-down-s-pen-settings-multiple-s-pens-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Top-down view of the S Pen settings on the Galaxy S25 Ultra surrounded by different types of S Pens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ureymsVfpyYAWMpfJfrWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra#viafoura-comments"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> </strong></p><p>It looks like Samsung might keep the S Pen on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, according to a fresh leak. Many S Pen fans have been fearing the worst for the past few months, and for good reason.</p><p>Samsung has been making some moves that the S Pen fans, even though in the minority, have been caught off guard. First, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor">it removed Bluetooth S Pen features on the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and more recently, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">ditched the S Pen on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, </a>as the Korean OEM wanted to keep things sleek and compact on the phone, which has caused us to think about the future of the S Pen itself.</p><p>While the company continues to make phones lighter and sleeker, we feel that the stylus could be a thing of the past. However, this may not be the case for the next-gen Galaxy S26 Ultra, a new leak from prominent tipster, Ice Universe, hints that the device will indeed keep the S Pen, with alleged device renders showing a dedicated slot for it.</p><h2 id="nothing-ear-3-launches-next-week-2">Nothing Ear 3 launches next week</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nTwNvbdpmU95TpBcBFAcVG" name="nothing-ear-3-first-look" alt="First look at Nothing Ear 3 wireless earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nTwNvbdpmU95TpBcBFAcVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With every product launch, Nothing basically drops a dozen teases, leaving absolutely nothing to the imagination, and it has followed the same pattern with its new earbuds set to launch on Sept. 18.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones">Nothing</a> officially showcased its upcoming wireless earbuds, the Nothing Ear 3, giving us our first look at the design and even a sneak peek at one of the features. The Nothing Ear 3 looks a lot like its predecessors, with a similar design, earbuds with white ear tips, and a transparent-looking stem with silver finishes inside. The case also looks similar to what we have seen before, with a new silver finish for the bottom and a transparent lid, like previous designs.</p><p>However, the company seems to have snuck in a new feature. The "Talk" button is right up front in the earbuds' case. The USB-C port on the right also seems to have a new microphone and/or speaker next to it. It's unclear what the new "Talk" button does, but we expect it to bring up Gemini or its features.</p><h2 id="samsung-could-bring-two-z-folds-next-year-2">Samsung could bring two Z Folds next year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-Blue-Shadow-5" alt="Blue Shadow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LeupYBjJLH3TukZ3DiV2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-two-galaxy-z-folds-in-2026-wide-fold"><strong>here</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-is-so-popular-samsung-scrambling-for-more">Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be a massive hit</a>, according to recent stats, where Samsung is basically scrambling to make more of its ultra-slim foldables.  And now, rumor has it that Samsung has allegedly "shared its development plans" for a second Fold model in 2026, according to an internal source. The publication adds that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8">Galaxy Z Flip 8 </a>will show up with two Z Folds, one being a "Wide" Fold model.</p><p>This Wide-Fold is reportedly aiming to combine dual 18:9 screens "to create an internal display with a nearly identical 18:18 aspect ratio." Basically, the Korean OEM could be going for a tablet-like phone. Furthermore, Samsung is looking to finalize the details about this phone by the end of September or early in October and is "expected to launch simultaneously" with 2026's expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Flip 8 and Fold 8.</a></p><h2 id="pixel-9-makes-google-the-fastest-growing-brand-2">Pixel 9 makes Google the fastest growing brand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-9-boosts-brand-to-fastest-growing-premium-smartphone-in-2025"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>Counterpoint, the research firm, put out some interesting numbers earlier this week, noting that the premium smartphone sales did indeed see an uptick in the first half of 2025. However, Google seems to have stolen the show. The company became the fastest-growing premium smartphone brand, seeing 105% YoY growth. The report suggests that its sales have basically doubled since last year, as more people are opting to buy the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 series</a>.</p><p>Google has been pushing into new markets and ramping up marketing for the Pixel phones. The company has been emphasizing the unique features of these devices by focusing on their AI capabilities and sleek software, rather than just highlighting specs, which has worked in the tech giant's favor.</p><p>Apple leads the premium market with a 62% share, despite seeing only a 3% YoY growth. While Samsung came second, seeing a 7% growth, thanks to the AI-powered Galaxy S25 series, which seems to have outdone its predecessor (20% market share).</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

The updated screen now offers a swipeable split between your basic music information and your "up next" screen. Starting with the former, the Now Playing screen still displays the album cover in the center with your media controls right under that.</p><p>However, the toggles to switch between audio (the song) and its video are no longer present above the album cover. YouTube Music has also brought its row of elements (like, dislike, comments, add to playlist) down under the media controls. The app removed Lyrics from the bottom, placing them within this repositioned row of options.</p><p>At the very bottom, users will notice a classic floating bar that mirrors what you'd see when using gestures on Android. Pulling up (swiping up) will display the songs YouTube Music plans to play next. The publication notes that users can pull this up part way, which will show four brief songs, or pull it up all the way to see a more extensive list.</p><p>When fully open, this full list makes the Now Playing screen extremely compact, minimizing the cover at the top left with the title, artist, casting icon, and the three-dot menu beside it. This minimized state will also occur when opening your Lyrics and Related options, too.</p><h2 id="youtube-music-brings-people-together-2">YouTube Music brings people together</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="PQps8eK9cL6PEUgvuRgc3J" name="youtube-music-now-playing-dual-pane-redesign" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing view has been reworked slightly, offering a dual pane view with a repositioned bar of options, for liking, disliking, saving, lyrics, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PQps8eK9cL6PEUgvuRgc3J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:261px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:229.89%;"><img id="Qmf3smy8KDYdprEy59Xd3J" name="youtube-music-now-playing-up-next-example" alt="YouTube Music's Now Playing features a dual-pane system now, which lets users swipe up from the bottom to view a few "up next" songs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qmf3smy8KDYdprEy59Xd3J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="261" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The publication reports that this update is slowly rolling out for mobile users (Android, iOS) today (Sep 12).

The celebration was all about how YouTube Music has continued to bring listeners and their favorite artists together on one platform. Not only was it a time to party, but it was also a time for the platform to highlight an update for users. Soon, YouTube Music listeners will get the option to create "taste match playlists."</p><p>These playlists will combine the musical tastes of you and another person to create a unique list of songs that represents you both. Moreover, YouTube Music states it's preparing to introduce live performance and upcoming show alerts for artists. These alerts are said to appear when you're engaging in their content on the platform.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I've used dozens of these drives over the course of the last decade, totaling over 120TB of storage.

It's exciting to see these drives now becoming available, and I tested the IronWolf Pro 30TB extensively.</p><p>The best part is that these 30TB drives can be slotted into existing NAS systems; Seagate sent over two 30TB drives, and I used them with the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus and DXP8800 Plus.

I thought that was plenty of storage at the time, and that machine served me well for several years. I upgraded to a machine with a 250GB hard drive in college, and eventually moved up to 1TB later on.</p><p>To now be able to store 30TB on a single drive is mind-boggling. My storage needs have sky-rocketed in recent years, and I now manage over 380TB across three NAS servers. Even then, I mostly use 18TB and 24TB drives, and it's exciting to see HDD manufacturers push the boundaries of recording technology.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LCPqLhkcXUHJSdXpwY7fdR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LCPqLhkcXUHJSdXpwY7fdR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The IronWolf Pro 30TB uses Seagate's HAMR tech to great effect. While it doesn't have the Mozaic 3+ label on the drive — unlike the 30TB Exos M — it is built on the same platform. The HAMR tech uses a laser to heat up a small portion of a platter to over 450 degrees Celsius (842 degrees Fahrenheit), and the magnetic head writes data into the heated section (which lasts just a nanosecond) at that time.</p><p>The goal with this tech is to maximize areal density, allowing Seagate to introduce platters that hold 3TB of data each. That's how Seagate managed to go up to 30TB on a drive; the IronWolf Pro 30TB has 10 disc platters, each holding 3TB of data. Seagate plans to increase areal density over the coming years, rolling out 32TB and 36TB HDDs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sBSLCdT3waNAdZCWf6sCaR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sBSLCdT3waNAdZCWf6sCaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/seagate-exos-x24-24tb-hdd-review">24TB Exos and IronWolf Pro drives</a>, the 30TB IronWolf Pro uses CMR tech to actually write the data onto the platter, with HAMR enabling the greater areal density. The IronWolf Pro 30TB HDD also gets the same feature-set that are present in other Seagate NAS drives, including vibration sensors, a 512MB cache, and 550TB/year endurance. The 3.5-inch drive spins at 7200RPM, uses the 6GB/s SATA interface, and has 2.5 million hours MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).</p><p>Coming to everyday use, the IronWolf Pro 30TB delivers over 265MB/s reads and 270MB/s writes. Reliability is just as great as other IronWolf Pro drives I used in recent years, and I didn't run into any issues in the two months I used the drive. I used it mostly to store data and move 4K video content to and from other NAS servers. Read/write is fast enough that it wasn't an issue while editing videos with the data stored on the NAS.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-seagate-ironwolf-pro-30tb-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB: What I don't like</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Hrmrna499eGL4o9DjW34eR" name="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB" alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hrmrna499eGL4o9DjW34eR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There isn't any limitation with the IronWolf Pro 30TBas such, and the only issue as of now is that it costs quite a bit.

Outside of that, the IronWolf Pro 30TB is just as reliable as the rest of its siblings; I didn't see any issues moving huge amounts of data to and from the drive, and it doesn't make too much noise.</p><p>Ultimately, if you see yourself needing up to 30TB of storage on a single drive, then you should just buy it. Yes, it costs a lot and isn't really the best value, but the storage potential it offers is unmatched right now.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2ba87657-5823-4fa8-909d-c46a17ccb374">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwMkhF966pATvTQrRWBgge.jpg' alt="Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD listing image"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Seagate IronWolf Pro 30TB NAS HDD</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>If you want to store massive amounts of data on a single drive, it doesn't get much better than the IronWolf Pro 30TB.

Arguably, the second-most striking of them all was the introduction of the iPhone Air, seemingly Apple's response to the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>I'm not one who really cares, or has ever cared, about really-thin phones, as they're usually accompanied by crappy battery life while missing out on other features. I suspect the same to be true of the iPhone Air, with the iPhone 17 Pro Max being more of my style, especially now that Apple has found a brand new orange ink cartridge.</p><p>But as the Apple event rolled on, it dawned on me that the iPhone Air isn't <em>just</em> a way for Apple to compete with Samsung. It's also serving as a sort of testing ground for what we've been expecting for years: a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16-series-has-me-convinced-apple-needs-a-foldable">foldable iPhone</a>.</p><h2 id="the-writing-is-on-the-wall-2">The writing is on the wall</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.05%;"><img id="8eT8kRg9yL2GzjprPf9j95" name="iphone-air-internals-logic-board-breakdown" alt="iPhone Air logic board and camera see-thru teardown" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8eT8kRg9yL2GzjprPf9j95.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1148" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The iPhone Air logic board and camera in a see-through visual. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was one part of the presentation that tipped me off to this, and it was when the design changes were being explained. In order to make a phone this thin and still give Apple the ability to market it as having "all-day battery," components had to be shifted around. So in order to make this work, Apple shoved all of the major components into the camera "plateau."</p><p>And I'm not exaggerating. The iPhone Air's entire logic board now rests inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/everyone-is-stealing-the-pixels-best-design-trait-and-im-loving-it">camera bar</a>, while still accounting for both the selfie and rear cameras. The rest of the chassis? It's pretty much a large, thin battery and a USB-C port.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The iPhone Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The iPhone Air internals, revealing a large thin battery and the logic board stuffed into the camera bar. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why does that matter? Well, if Apple wants to release a foldable iPhone that isn't immediately laughed out of existence, it needs to be thinner than what previous iPhone models were — especially considering how late Apple is with getting into the game.</p><p>Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-23/apple-aapl-explores-turning-watches-into-wearable-ai-devices-with-cameras-m8ll6mvy">rumors</a> point to Apple's first foldable phone to be a book-style foldable, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as opposed to a flip phone, like the popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">Razr 2025 series</a>. Given Apple's propensity for being a crowd-pleaser, I initially thought the opposite was true —  since <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> tend to be more popular due to their nostalgic design and cheaper price tag —  but the iPhone Air pretty much solidifies the book-style rumors.</p><p>In order to release a phone that's thin, sleek, and modern, without making <em>too many</em> sacrifices, Apple had to hit the design reset button. This is likely what spurred the decision to overhaul the iPhone Pro lineup, while also introducing an all-new device. It also doesn't hurt that we were overdue for a proper design change, as the previous iterations were already stale, even with the Titanium frame.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf" name="iphone-air-fold-mock-render" alt="Mockup of iPhone Fold based on iPhone Air" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HmPVR9kvVmKqtX9Lj4zTqf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A mockup of an iPhone Fold based on the iPhone Air design. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With that said, I can't help but feel like the iPhone Air design is a precursor to an eventual foldable. If you tape two iPhone Airs together, side-by-side, that's a pretty good indication of what Apple's first foldable could look like. Of course, that tape will be replaced by some state-of-the-art hinge that "only Apple could make." Or at least that's what we'll be told.</p><p>Even if that isn't the case, there's no denying that seeing Apple being able to redesign basically every element of the phone to fit into a phone this thin is simply extraordinary. The iPhone Air (5.64mm) is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> (5.8mm), but isn't quite nearly as thin as the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> (5.2mm) or the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (4.2mm). But an iPhone foldable easily could be.</p><h2 id="the-iphone-air-is-a-great-start-to-something-greater-2">The iPhone Air is a great start to something greater</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8" name="iphone-air-announcement-render" alt="Apple iPhone Air announcement render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cs2uoQHc5TBKFCEmwkmmF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nevertheless, seeing what Apple was able to do with the iPhone Air and how it committed the resources to creating a phone like this to begin with leaves me feeling much better about Apple's first foldable phone.

Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://mingchikuo.craft.me/84AOn3Ll8Zah6f">also point</a> to it being between 4.5mm and 4.8mm thin, meaning that Apple still has a bit of work to do, but the iPhone Air is a good start.</p><p>Android Central contributor and resident thin-phone fanboy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/brady-snyder" target="_blank">Brady </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/author/brady-snyder" target="_blank">Snyder</a>, probably summed up the iPhone Air the best way: "The entire body of the iPhone Air is just the battery, and the camera bump actually houses the entire logic board.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I'm a diligent note-taker; I jot down thoughts on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/remarkable-2-review">reMarkable 2</a> and use a physical notebook (from Leuchtturm1917) along with a Lamy Safari to journal. I like the convenience and ease-of-use of the reMarkable 2, and it is ideal to take notes while attending briefings and organizing my to-do lists.</p><p>In the last month, though, I've been using a new product: the Flowtica Scribe. It is a regular pen that has a built-in mic that lets records meetings and conversations, and connects to a mobile app to automatically transcribe those recordings and generate summaries. I have Teenage Engineering's TP–7 on hand and used that in the past, but the Flowtica Scribe pulls double duty on account of it being a standard pen you can take notes with. Flowtica is crowdsourcing the Scribe, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flowtica/flowtica-scribe-ai-pen-records-and-understands-your-highlights">available on Kickstarter for $169</a>, a $130 discount from its projected retail price of $299.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="N5L3zeVeukaY3z3si7Sm4j" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5L3zeVeukaY3z3si7Sm4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Scribe has a barrel design that looks like any other pen, and it isn't all that heavy either. There are pogo pins at the back, and you get a button up top along with one on the side. Obviously, it isn't as smooth to write with as a fountain pen, nor is it as good as Uni-ball's Jetstream gel or Air rollerball products. That said, the Scribe is decent enough in its own right, and you get five refills included in the box.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5015px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="btpFjjnweYtghkFzvU3sri" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btpFjjnweYtghkFzvU3sri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5015" height="2825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4CYSUvPZpJ9BHDKp8XMB8j" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CYSUvPZpJ9BHDKp8XMB8j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oXRX3uif9ceuF3kxffNhri" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oXRX3uif9ceuF3kxffNhri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VuAtk3V2GN5AYStT27TYji" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VuAtk3V2GN5AYStT27TYji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="U2DCdz7kCENeCreNRwMVti" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U2DCdz7kCENeCreNRwMVti.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It's easy to get started with the recording feature of the Scribe: just hold down the top button for two seconds.

The built-in recorder is very good, and it had no problems picking up audio. It's designed to be used in meetings, so I turned to it while attending recent product briefings, and it did a good job highlighting individual speakers.</p><p>You'll need to use the Flowtica app to access stored data, and as of writing, it's available only on iOS. Flowtica notes that it is coming up with an Android app too, but it wasn't available in the testing window. My favorite feature of the Scribe is its ability to automatically transcribe audio to text; while there are plenty of tools that do this today, the sheer convenience is novel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5151px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="jmE6nibhTBmNKxEZRkEjQj" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jmE6nibhTBmNKxEZRkEjQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5151" height="2901" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Transcribed text is available in the Flowtica app, and it analyzes the text to deliver AI-generated summaries as well. They're nifty to have, but not something I normally use — the utility of having transcribed text available just moments after recording is what sells the Scribe for me. You can also save your handwritten notes; just take an image and upload it to the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="698MxDWvKJw5dvCeHtJNbj" name="Flowtica Scribe" alt="Flowtica Scribe testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/698MxDWvKJw5dvCeHtJNbj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4268" height="2404" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AI is everywhere these days, and while I'm still ambivalent about most of the utilities that are available, I routinely use transcribing features, and the Scribe does a great job in this regard. The fact that it's a physical product that I can use as a normal pen makes it all the better, and if you're interested in what the Scribe has to offer, you can get your hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/flowtica/flowtica-scribe-ai-pen-records-and-understands-your-highlights">AI-enabled pen for $169</a>.

Honestly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-best-sounding-earbuds">it isn't even close</a>. Chalk this up to the software that drives ANC plus the quality of the hardware, but I've used hundreds or pairs of ANC earbuds and headphones and Bose does it the best.</p><p>It's assumed you want the best ANC you can find, but other things are important, too. Bose has you covered. They are chunky lil' fellows but the fit is surprisingly better than you would expect when looking at them. That's important because everyone hates earbuds that don't fit well.</p><p>The sound is pretty good, too. Yes, they are still earbuds with tiny drivers and you're playing back via Bluetooth so it's not the best ever, but as far as ANC earbuds go you'll have no complaints. The buds handle most ranges of sound from bass to treble well, and the mids sound exceptionally good.</p><p>Even the app is really good. It's modern and lets you adjust the sound to your liking while still trying to make things easy; not everyone wants to fiddle with a 10-band virtual equalizer.</p><p>If you only care about getting the best ANC earbuds you can buy, these are for you.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:679px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Eny8jnLK8Kht9tVYgLAuvB" name="AirPods4-lifestyle" alt="Apple AirPods 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eny8jnLK8Kht9tVYgLAuvB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="679" height="382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="2-apple-airpods-4-2"><span class="title__text">2.

The Apple AirPods 4 are no exception.</p><p>When it comes to the best bang for your buck, nothing out there matches these. No, they're not the newest, but you're not paying the price that the newest check in with, either.</p><p>The thing is, you'll either love or hate the way they fit. Apple redesigned the way AirPods fit with the 4th generation, and a lot of folks say they nailed it. Others say it was still terrible. Since they don't use interchangeable parts for fitting, they either fit you or they don't, and nothing can change that.</p><p>Next, I have to talk about battery life. If you need ANC earbuds with a long-lasting battery, these are not for you. You can stretch it out with the case, but with ANC running, don't expect these to last more than four hours on the best of days.</p><p>If you're Ok with the battery and the AirPods 4 fit you well, you'll love the value you're getting. I've seen these on sale for as low as $100, and they are definitely better than most $100 noise-cancelling earbuds. The sound is good (not the best, but far from the worst) and features like transparency and conversational awareness are not expected at this price.</p><p>If good, cheap earbuds with ANC are what you're after, you have to check out the AirPods 4 before you make any buying decisions.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-battery-life"><span>Best battery life</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.06%;"><img id="zec76HCJxykST8HnoXEi8B" name="sony-wf-1000xm5-qi-wireless-charging.jpg" alt="The Sony WF-1000XM5 in black wirelessly charging on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zec76HCJxykST8HnoXEi8B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1749" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony / Twitter)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-sony-wf-1000xm5-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">3.

You'll have no complaints about the audio quality, the connectivity, the fit inside your ear, or the noise cancellation itself. Then we get to the battery life.</p><p>It's simply phenomenal. The company rates their use at about 6 hours when using ANC, and that's right in line with what you're going to get. Six hours doesn't sound like a lot (and really, it's never enough), but when you're talking about earbuds with tiny batteries and a power-hungry process like ANC, you won't find long battery life on a spec sheet. These are the best of the best when it comes to time between charges.</p><p>The only real issue I've found is with low-latency audio using Sony's LC3 codec, which can drop audio from time to time.

I love the audio quality they deliver with or without ANC turned on, but I hate that high-quality codec support is limited to newer Galaxy Devices.</p><p>That's the rub—if you use a phone like a Galaxy S24 or S25, you can use Samsung's proprietary SSC Ultra-High-Quality audio codec, and the sound the Buds Pro 3 deliver is, well, better than any wireless earbuds should be able to deliver. It's really that good and better than anything Qualcomm or Sony brings with AptX and LDAC, respectively.</p><p>Part of the reason is the big (for earbuds) 10.3mm drivers used for low and middle-frequency sounds, paired with a 6.1mm planar audio driver for higher-frequency sounds, but Samsung's audio codec does the heavy lifting. There's also no support for LDAC hq audio on other Android phones.</p><p>Still, there is no denying how good these sound with the right source. I tested with a Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus once it was updated to support the SSC codec and could not believe the difference.</p><p>They sound good without using a supported device, and all around, the audio quality, ANC, fit, and app (which you really need for best results) are great.

They do have an excellent fit, and the touch sensitivity is wonderful.</p><p>The real star of the show is Google and its plans for the future.

They <em><strong>don't</strong></em> have wireless charging, support for any HQ audio codecs, and the silicon tips work for most people, but not everyone. But they are about $100 cheaper and come in a cool transparent blue color if you're into something different.</p><p>I really enjoy these earbuds and the way they respond to any sort of software-based equalizer. Out of the box, you probably won't love the way they sound, so you really need to use Sony's app to "tune" them in to your liking.

For most people, the audible hiss and droning buzz ANC causes have disappeared, and you probably will never know that it's turned on and running.</p><p>The reasons are obvious: isolate sound to your ears and you hear more of what you want to hear. Simply having ANC doesn't necessarily mean headphones will block all sounds, so the differences come down to variances. Some headphones will drown out more ambient noise than others will. Thankfully, you don't have to buy the most expensive pair of earbuds with ANC to get great noise cancellation - any pair on this list will do the job well, even the more budget-friendly picks.</p><p>Because they are earbuds, fit and comfort play a big role, too. Wireless earbuds nestled into your ears to provide passive isolation to help block ambient noise, so the way your earbuds fit is important. You'll probably have the best luck with a pair that uses silicon tips of various sizes.</p><p>Apps and software offer additional benefits for ANC. Some may even have "adaptive ANC", which adjusts the potency in real time based on how much noise the onboard microphones detect. You'll find this, if available, in the companion app for your earbuds so be sure to check it out.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the oldest and most trusted Android sites on the web <br>☑️ Over 15 years of product testing <br>☑️ Thousands of products reviewed and tested since 2007 <br>☑️ Dozens of audio products tested by our team every year</p></div></div><p>We review plenty of headphones and earbuds because almost everyone with a phone has a set or two. Knowing what's good is important.</p><p>I'm also a bit of a headphone addict. I've been known to spend too much time obsessing over the smallest details and have access to most every new product once it's commercially available. So I try them all if I can.</p><p>I've personally used each of these, and while ANC isn't for me, I know what to look for and what works. I like and would recommend every pair on this list, and I think it's the right place to start when it's time to buy a little something for yourself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For the Moto G 2026, the publication claims the device will see a design pretty similar to what consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">received earlier this year</a>. The device will have a flat display with a square camera bump on its rear panel. The post claims the sides are "mostly flat," but they apparently "curve towards both the front and back sides."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="XUTBsjbQLjJczbwEQSA9iG" name="motorola-g-2026-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of the Moto G 2026 with the same design as its 2025 counterpart.

The phone's bezels are a little odd, as they're not exactly thin, and there's also a noticeable "chin" at the bottom. The back is rumored to at least hold a 50MP primary lens, while the selfie camera could debut at 32MP.</p><p>Internally, the post suggests we could see a 5,200mAh battery, which would be only 200mAh higher <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">than the 2024 edition</a>, if true. It also purports 4GB of RAM (with a RAM booster option, too) and 128GB internal storage options. However, this 128GB can be expanded via a microSD, most likely. Motorola is rumored to settle with MediaTek for its G 2026, opting for the Dimensity 6300 SoC.</p><p>This is the same chip that powered the Moto G 2025 and G Power 2025. Motorola is speculated to have Android 16 running on this mid-range device out of the box.</p><h2 id="the-g-play-2">The G Play</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:602px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.67%;"><img id="yQVhgcKNQqJ7ZaDy3dTHB7" name="motorola-g-play-2026-leaked-render" alt="A leaked rendering of the Moto G Play 2026, showing its square rear camera bump and a noticeable bezel chin on its display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yQVhgcKNQqJ7ZaDy3dTHB7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="602" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication claims that the Moto G Play will mirror the G 2026, and the renders certainly double down on that speculation. The phones look incredibly similar, even with the square, raised camera bump on the back.</p><p>However, there are some alleged subtle differences. The Moto G Play 2026 will continue the 6.7-inch display (with that noticeable chin) and 4GB of RAM; however, its available storage dips way down to 64GB, though it is "expandable." The G Play 2026 is also allegedly receiving a lower-strength 32MP primary camera and an 8MP selfie camera.</p><p>While the usual Motorola-branded software and other AI features are expected, like the Moto G 2026, the G Play will see a 5,200mAh battery, as well. The post notes that this model will see slower charging compared to its likely launch partner.</p><p>Earlier this year, Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">launched its G 2025 and G Power 2025</a> models, with starting prices under $300. This was a major highlight for the company, as it delivered a pair of good-looking phones for cheap. More than that, they packed some decent batteries and okay charging speeds. They're no flagship, but for a mid-range, they weren't that bad. Also, the company is seemingly shifting its G Play to a design that mirrors these other two models, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2024-launch">the 2024 model didn't</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-play-2024-launch">Moto G Play 2024</a> offered a raised camera bump that is more rectangular than square. Still, Motorola is keeping that noticeable chin on this device, like the rest of the mid-range models it's launched.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fortunately, an Amazon deal has come along to change all of that. For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank"><strong>you can grab 40% off the price of the JBL Tune 510BT headphones</strong></a>, bringing the price down to just $30.</p><p>These foldable, over-ear Bluetooth headphones are said to offer up to 40 hours of battery life, along with a bass-heavy sound, and a USB-C port for quick charging. While they don't feature as many of the bells and whistles as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a>, they certainly aren't a bad pick for those on a serious budget.</p><p>While they don't feature active noise cancellation, these JBL headphones do include a built-in microphone for easy compatibility with voice assistants such as Google Assistant and Alexa, or for phone and video calls. It's also worth noting that this particular deal is only available for these headphones in the White and Black colors.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:118.27%;"><img id="8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX" name="jbl-tune-510bt-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8fMGRHEFxp4bqfqD8TLrQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>JBL Tune 510BT Headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-510BT-Ear-Headphones/dp/B08WM3LMJF" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$49.95" data-dimension48="$49.95" data-dimension25=""><del>$49.95</del> <strong>$29.95 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is offering these affordable JBL wireless headphones for 40% off the normal price, representing $20 in savings and cutting the price to just $30.

Even at their normal price point of $60, they seem like a decent offering from JBL with up to 40 hours of battery life per charge, and 2 additional hours of listening per 5-minute charge with the USB-C cable.</p><p>They also include a built-in microphone, physical playback and volume controls, and a folding design that makes them pretty easy to stow and transport.</p><p>These come with the JBL Pure Bass sound, according to the company, though users who don't like this can simply EQ audio toward a more treble-oriented sound using their phone's built-in equalization controls. The speaker cups on these are a bit smaller than those of most premium headphones, which can definitely be a positive for some buyers while being a negative for others.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Arriving in Gmail's sidebar (in app and on PC), users will notice a new "Purchases" email label. Google states tapping Purchases will give you a "bird's eye view of all your upcoming package deliveries in one simple, organized list." From this view, users will find an "Arriving Soon" section at the top, similar to what you'd find in your primary inbox.</p><p>This is reserved for packages that should be delivered within the next 24 hours. Below that, users will find the list of emails containing those tracking details and order confirmation. This update is rolling out today (Sep 11) for all personal Gmail accounts, so keep your eye out for it.</p><p>Additionally, Google says the "Arriving Soon" section in your primary email, as well as tracking details within order emails themselves, will not leave.</p><p>The second update concerns Gmail's "Promotions" tab. This tab will now offer a "nudge," bringing up promotions and discounts that are timely, so you're in the loop. More than that, a new sorting option, "Most Relevant," is on the way, which Google says pushes Gmail to display promotions from brands you're more likely to engage with. Users can sort by "most recent," too, if you're interested in just seeing the emails as they arrive.</p><h2 id="gmail-for-the-holidays-2">Gmail for the holidays</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D" name="gmail-purchases-tracking-tab-update" alt="Gmail's getting a new "Purchases" tab, which highlights every order and purchase made in one convenient place for tracking." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ggFQFkjSaba5p3iim7JZ8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="750" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D" name="gmail-promotions-tab-sorting-update" alt="Google's updating Gmail's Promotion tab with new sorting options to help users see deals that they care for the most." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i5c56zwBYN684p9FFPJT8D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google, Gmail, and the holidays seem to be a regular thing as of late, as even last year, an update rolled out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail-now-uses-a-new-ai-model-to-try-and-fend-off-holiday-scams">help users avoid scams</a>. The company implemented a new AI model in Gmail in December last year to determine what's a scam and what isn't. Google said its AI models were successful in blocking ~20% more scam attempts and are also reviewing 1,000 times more user-reported spam events.</p><p>These protections are still in place, and Google still encourages users to be vigilant on their own.</p><p>A Gemini update for Gmail arrived this year, making it way easier to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">take important dates and events from an email</a> and put them into Calendar. If Google's AI detects a date within an email, an "add to calendar" button will appear for convenience. The AI will automatically create an event centered around it, leaving you the choice of further editing that newly created event for clarity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As if it were in a carnival, Apple's iPhone was found by Google Pixel in a batch of chicken feed, with the cuties running around in the background, too.

Apple Intelligence sort of took a step back, grabbing subtle upgrades over what users already have to play with (though it's still not everything). Apple brought the new Liquid Glass design, Live Translations for audio and text, among others.</p><p>Here's the thing: it's already been a year since Apple debuted its AI intelligence for its iPhone users, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-should-ditch-siri-for-gemini-and-google-cloud-heres-why">and they still haven't gotten</a> everything promised. In fact, most of those features are <em>still </em>delayed. That setback has pushed things back for likely another year. It's not as though Apple doesn't have its own strong, clear vision of what its AI intelligence should look like—it does. But the delays and problems it's encountering have left some wondering if Apple should just settle with Gemini.</p><p>This #BestPhonesForever series on YouTube by Google is its way of having "fun" with Apple, kind of like when it responded to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-teases-apple-iphone-17-pixel-design-copy-rumors">rumors about the iPhone 17's design</a>.

I bought a Galaxy S25 Edge with my own cash and plan to do the same with the iPhone Air, and in this guide, I'll help you figure out how these two smartphones compare.</p><p>For those who don't quite understand the appeal of thin phones, here's a quick overview. There are certainly some people who use every percentage of their phone's battery life each day and all of its features. However, there's also a subset of users that don't need extremely long battery life or a pro-grade camera system. For them, it's arguably better to carry a thin and light phone daily, and add separate tools like a MagSafe/Qi2 battery pack or a dedicated camera when they're really needed.</p><p>If that sounds like you, an iPhone Air or Galaxy S25 Edge might be the change you need. I ditched heavy and thick flagships this year and haven't looked back. But you'll want to pick the right one — here's how to decide.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-design-and-display-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR" name="iPhone-Air-1" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PB8JekBamAsqENCzYkyhR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartphone manufacturers have been cheating on thinness for ages with camera bumps and creative math — there isn't a single brand that includes the thickness of the camera bump in their official measurements, and foldable phones even omit the size of the internal bezel when talking about their unfolded measurements.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone Air</a> takes this practice to the extreme. It doesn't have a camera bump; it has a camera <em>plateau</em>, and it practically houses the entire phone — the rest of the chassis is filled almost entirely with battery. This strategy makes the iPhone Air feel impossibly thin, with much of the body measuring only 5.6mm thick. At the same time, the plateau will protrude further off the back of the phone than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.</p><p>By comparison, Samsung made the Galaxy S25 Edge measure 5.8mm thick. The difference of 0.2mm in thickness might sound minuscule, but early first impressions from those who have held the Air seem to show it's a difference you can feel, which may be attributed to its curvier chassis.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-4" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ECSmSHQksozF4ZQPvUWw8a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a big difference in screen size and overall form factor between the iPhone Air and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. The former has a 6.5-inch screen, which slots in between what would typically be a base or a plus-sized phone. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a 6.7-inch display that's identical in size to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>. Both phones are using AMOLED screens with 120Hz LTPO support, but the iPhone is slightly brighter, topping out at 3,000 nits.</p><p>It's worth noting that due to all the components in the iPhone Air camera plateau, Apple had to shift the Dynamic Island and Face ID sensors down to make everything fit. This means the pill-shaped camera cutout will cut deeper into the iPhone Air display, obstructing more of your content. The Galaxy S25 Edge has a hole-punch camera cutout in the display that's much more minimal than what the iPhone Air offers.</p><p>The iPhone Air also has an anti-reflective coating similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Both phones use a titanium construction for durability and feature IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.</p><p>Personally, I'm torn on which phone looks better. To me, the reasonably small rear camera bump is a huge appeal of the Galaxy S25 Edge, but it's hard not to be impressed by the 5.6mm thickness of the iPhone Air.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hardware-and-specs-2">iPhone Air vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR" name="iPhone-Air-4" alt="The iPhone 17 Air in press renders in all colors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QufzJGHEhvERTdej7qdzkR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge both impressively retain similar performance to that of their "Pro" and "Ultra" counterparts.

By that logic, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge effectively has <em>three</em> cameras.

On top of that, the Samsung phone has a 12MP ultrawide camera for wide shots.</p><p>Apple's 18MP front-facing camera on the iPhone Air is impressive. It features a square sensor that enables horizontal and portrait selfies without physically rotating the device.

Compared to Apple's thin handset, the Galaxy S25 Edge has a flagship processor without binning, a faster USB-C port, stereo speakers, a rear ultrawide camera, a larger display, and a smaller front-facing camera cutout. However, it's slightly thicker and more expensive than the iPhone Air.</p><p>There's just one reason why it's extremely difficult to recommend the Galaxy S25 Edge over the iPhone Air. The former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">doesn't have Qi2 magnets onboard</a>, and this feels like a mandatory feature for thin phones with shorter battery life. The iPhone Air, having MagSafe and Qi2 support, means you can quickly and easily top up the phone with a battery pack in a pinch. It'll be much tougher to do so on the Galaxy S25 Edge without a case, and adding a case somewhat defeats the point of a thin phone.</p><p>Otherwise, the choice might come down to whether you prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>. Neither phone is perfect, but both the iPhone Air and Galaxy S25 Edge are a breath of fresh air for people disenfranchised by thick, heavy smartphones.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="03e3c250-82a4-4fff-a02c-de01413737ec">            <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-air/" data-model-name="Apple iPhone Air" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Thin above all else</strong></em></p><p>The iPhone Air is for people who want a futuristic-feeling phone with thinness that feels too good to be true.

You have a similar design with a stem style and earbuds with white ear tips and a transparent-looking stem with silver finishes inside.</p><p>The case also looks similar to what we have seen before, with a new silver finish for the bottom and a transparent lid, like previous designs. However, this is where things get interesting.</p><h2 id="nothing-s-case-gets-more-functional-2">Nothing's case gets more functional</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">18th September 📆Nothing ear (3) pic.twitter.com/NvHbWXVQpn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1966140666834202942">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The teaser shows a new "Talk" button right up front in the earbuds' case. The USB-C port on the right also seems to have a new microphone and/or speaker next to it.</p><p>Nothing hasn't gone into details, but in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/41833-offbeat-looks-stronger-signal-material-difference">community post</a>, the company calls this a "Super Mic." It's unclear what the new "Talk" button does, but we expect it relates to talking to an AI chatbot directly through the earbuds' case.</p><p>Another new detail about the case is that Nothing has used "100% anodised recycled aluminium," which the company says provides improved durability and a premium finish. In addition, the company says it has refined the earbuds’ design by minimizing clearance between components and has also "reengineered the metal antenna to a flat finish and controlled its thickness to just 0.35 mm."</p><p>The company hasn't revealed new features or full specs yet, based on past launches, it's likely we'll see more details ahead of launch. Pricing and availability details are likely to be announced at the official launch on September 18, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While we got to test out Meta Orion at last year's Connect, that pair was never intended to be a product you could walk into a store and buy.</p><p>Meta Hypernova may be called Meta Celeste when it launches later this year, but we'll need to wait for Connect to be sure. Essentially, Meta Celeste can be considered a hybrid between a smartwatch, smartphone, and existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. A small display is said to be in one of the lenses, which can show notifications, turn-by-turn directions, and even some apps.</p><p>The glasses are rumored to ship with Meta's most popular apps preinstalled (WhatsApp, Messenger, etc) and will connect to your phone to sync relevant information. Just like a smartwatch, it should have its own OS, processor, and a unique input system that relies on hand tracking and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">a gesture bracelet</a> to make virtual interaction feel seamless.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG" name="meta-hypernova-leaked-render" alt="A leaked render of Meta Hypernova or Meta Celeste smart glasses and the sEMG wristband" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVkmiZjCv4R7taoaFErcYG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1654" height="930" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Luna (@Lunayian) on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're also expecting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Gen 3</a> to make a debut at Connect, and it seems like Meta is doing something interesting with this release. Instead of three different frame styles with your choice of lenses in each, it's rumored that Meta is making separate sunglasses and prescription glasses frames to widen compatibility with lenses.</p><p>Some users were unable to use Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">they don't support strong prescriptions</a>, something a dedicated pair of prescription Ray-Ban frames would be able to do. Meta should be launching a new version of Meta AI with these Gen 3 Ray-Bans, as well as Meta Hypernova, which allows Meta AI to see the world around you for much longer.</p><p>This would enable Meta AI to give you personalized memory-based responses. For instance, you may be able to ask Meta AI where you left your keys or where it last saw your phone. It's even said that Meta AI will be able to remember people's names and faces with this update.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="btaFpdvbzhfRHsmNotaeKJ" name="ray-ban-meta-3-leak-16x9" alt="Leaked renders of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses (Gen 3)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/btaFpdvbzhfRHsmNotaeKJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: XR Research Institute)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta has a lot of upcoming competition, including a rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazons-secret-ar-glasses-project-codenamed-jayhawk-aims-to-rival-metas-dominance">pair of smartglasses from Amazon</a> and upcoming Android XR-powered smart glasses from Google's partners.

Looking into any Security & Privacy changes unearthed a notification within those settings that might've teased Google's work to pair Identity Check with the Pixel Watch. The company's early code reads, "Identity Check works with your Pixel Watch."</p><p>It adds, "Prevent others from opening your apps that require fingerprint or face unlock. When connected to your Pixel Watch, your security is assured with greater mobility."</p><p>Currently, as Rahman states, it seems this smartwatch integration will let users decide to use their PIN, pattern, or password, removing the necessity of using a Biometric method (fingerprint, face). Of course, this will only work when your watch and phone are within range, making it a little easier to hop into your apps when out in public spaces. Moreover, a discovered string of code seems to suggest this updated Identity Check with Pixel Watch will only support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-one-year-later">Pixel Watch 3</a> and higher (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>).</p><p>Rahman concludes by noting a potential update to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-enable-identity-check">Identity Check</a> as a whole, which is spreading its Biometric requirement to even more apps. Additionally, the post states the Android 16 code suggests using your screen lock credentials will no longer be an option.</p><h2 id="keeping-your-data-safe-2">Keeping your data safe</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9ftuBUuenNKQ8ByWumsg9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>These changes to Identity Check for Android 16 might make it feel a little more approachable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-could-bring-identity-check-to-more-smartphones">as it's currently not like that</a>.

This must be done when accessing passkeys and passwords, and even changing PINs and interacting with the Find My Device network.</p><p>If/when this arrives, it'll be good to see Google finally letting users choose their PIN or password as an alternative if their supported Pixel Watch is close.</p><p>On the other hand, it seems Google's even preparing to bring Identity Check to more devices.

There's a secondary coil inside the Qi mat that allows you to attach the Apple Watch, and it's just plain cool.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="UNJoxRdwXwc6RaQSRNYYVg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UNJoxRdwXwc6RaQSRNYYVg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2780" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4956px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="9iyeiRdguHVY52SoUAwyVg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9iyeiRdguHVY52SoUAwyVg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4956" height="2792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="D8savCDyiGb9vs4jbijDkg" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D8savCDyiGb9vs4jbijDkg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It takes a few tries to understand how to position the Apple Watch on the power bank, but once I figured it out, I didn't see any issues. The power bank itself is on the smaller side as these things go, and at 210g, it isn't all that heavy either. It has a plastic chassis, and build quality is pretty good. The kickstand is quite handy as well, and it lets you use your phone while it's charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SE8djVnN6jnQGJBw2gMk4h" name="Stuffcool Click Trio" alt="Stuffcool Click Trio 10,000mAh power bank testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SE8djVnN6jnQGJBw2gMk4h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only caveat when using the Click Trio with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/i-used-the-apple-watch-series-10-for-six-months-heres-why-its-still-the-best-smartwatch">Apple Watch Series 10</a> is that it's limited to 3W, so it takes a few hours to charge the smartwatch.

The video came with a slogan "Refined.

Some of the icon changes that caught our eye were a circular torch icon with a red light, circular icons for Bluetooth and Dark Mode toggles, new icons for what appear to be temperature control and brightness adjustment widgets, and new icons for a to-do list widget and a pill-shaped switch.</p><p>Furthermore, the company seems to have added a new color to its existing monochromatic red color palette.

To create a satellite SOS that's easy to use—even when you can't use its screen, according to Google's Sharath Ananth—the company had to consider "positioning interface, audio cues, and haptic feedback." Some of these cues are even available during the satellite SOS initial startup phase, accompanied by a demonstration of how to orient the device.</p><p>Right out of the gate, Google said it knew of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> limit: the fact that it lacks the number of antennas that a phone typically has. In short, Google says the device can't connect to <em>all </em>networks simultaneously, so the company made it so the Pixel Watch 4 will switch if terrestrial networks fail.</p><p>The device is said to offer the satellite option to keep you connected when trying to call emergency services. If you opt in, Google says your Watch 4 will provide a questionnaire to get all the information possible before sending it.</p><p>Google's lead engineer for the Pixel Watch, Sharath Ananth, adds that the satellite SOS mode pretty much locks you into it until help arrives. Ananth says, "...emergencies can be stressful, so we wanted to make it easier to focus on getting help." After 911 has arrived, users can tap "help has arrived" or "I don't need help anymore" to return to their Pixel Watch 4's full experience with apps and more.</p><h2 id="staying-in-contact-2">Staying in contact</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U6Cr6En6hizd8XEPyFF3Wc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-AI-Smart-Replies-1" alt="Sending a message on the Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6Cr6En6hizd8XEPyFF3Wc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3880" height="2182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Getting people help in emergencies is the backbone of a feature like satellite SOS. Ananth says this feature isn't only looking out for adventurers on hikes, but everyone in between, too: "I think about getting stranded somewhere, anywhere, and if your phone isn’t working or if you’re injured, this allows you to still activate satellite SOS from your wrist."</p><p>While Google has done a lot of work behind the scenes, with testing in U.S. National Parks to get this to work, it's also using Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a>. When the chip was announced, it was stated that the Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to use this new wearable SoC. While its power is just okay, this chip supports Skylo's Narrowband Non-Terrestrial Network (NB-NTN), making satellite messaging a reality.</p><p>There are other emergency/safety features on the Pixel Watch 4, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-feature-drop">Crash Detection</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-explains-fall-detection">Fall Detection</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it looks like not all is well, as early <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap Ring Stand</a> users have already started reporting issues.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/10/pixelsnap-ring-stand-loose-screw-reports/">9to5Google</a>, many users on Reddit are complaining that the screws on the accessory are coming loose. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nd1362/psa_dont_use_the_pixelsnap_ring_stand_without_a/">users report</a> that their Ring Stand felt "a little wobbly" after just a week, and only a few days later, the screws had fallen off after "no more than 100 folds."</p><p>The user even went on to say that the screws wedged between the case and stand, leaving "shallow scratches" on their case.</p><p>What's worse is that this doesn't seem to be an isolated issue. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1n463dx/pixelsnap_ring_stand_broken_in_2_days/">Another Reddit user</a> said their Pixelsnap Ring Stand had loosened so much after just two days of use that it could no longer support their phone's weight.</p><h2 id="pixelsnap-ring-stand-might-not-be-as-sturdy-as-promised-2">Pixelsnap Ring Stand might not be as sturdy as promised</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="QT9KosiZMmZ9gEfg2PqkgX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-XL-Pixelsnap-Ring-Stand" alt="Pixelsnap Ring on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QT9KosiZMmZ9gEfg2PqkgX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2832" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those unfamiliar with the Pixelsnap Ring Stand, the accessory has two small screws near the hinge. These screws secure the moving ring to the magnetic base and create enough friction to keep the ring stable, allowing the accessory to support a phone's weight. It seems these screws are loosening for many users within weeks (or even days) of use.</p><p>There isn't a proper fix yet, though the publication suggests that affected users can use a T1 Torx bit to tighten the screws. Google hasn't officially addressed the issue, but if complaints keep growing, the company may soon issue a statement.</p><p>For now, if you're looking for a Pixelsnap Ring Stand–style accessory for your Pixel 10, it may be better to consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-popsockets">third-party phone grips</a>. Brands like Spigen and Anker offer similar phone grips, though Google's Pixelsnap Ring Stand is arguably the most pleasing to look at.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e5ab511d-d435-4802-bebc-a5ada7791994">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJcJyhTSGHkBRpkpPdhcJi.jpg' alt="Spigen O-Mag Ring Magnetic Phone Holder"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Spigen O-Mag Ring</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Durable Pixelsnap Ring Stand alternative</strong></em></p><p>Spigen's O-Mag Ring offers a Pixelsnap Ring Stand like functionality attaching magnetically to the back of the Pixel 10 phones.

Like last year's A18-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>, the platforms are built on a 3nm node, and they share a similar core configuration, offering two performance and six efficiency cores. However, there are clear upgrades available this year, and Apple isn't beating around the bush:</p><p>"When paired with the Apple-designed vapor chamber, A19 Pro enables iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max to deliver up to 40 percent better sustained performance than the previous generation." Obviously, that doesn't mean the A19 Pro is going to be 40% faster than the A18 Pro — that's just not feasible.</p><p>What Apple is alluding to is sustained performance; thanks to a new thermal management system that includes a vapor chamber with deionized water, the latest-gen iPhones will be able to do a much better job during extended gaming sessions. Of course, this is something Android phones have been doing for many years now, and it's telling that Apple is also going this route to deliver better performance.</p><h2 id="what-kind-of-performance-can-we-expect-2">What kind of performance can we expect?</h2><p>As for actual upgrades, we are likely to see anywhere to the tune of a 10 to 15% uptick in CPU performance, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/search?q=iphone18">leaked Geekbench results</a> of the iPhone 17 Pro indicate the same. Even if it isn't much in the way of IPC gains as the A19 Pro is clocked higher at 4.26GHz, it's still a decent amount year-over-year, and it's entirely possible the GPU gains will be greater. Efficiency is also a big deal with this generation, with the efficiency cores getting a 50% increase in cache.</p><p>What's of particular interest to me is that the A19 Pro once again takes the lead in overall CPU scores; while this was the case for much of the last decade, Qualcomm's switch to a fully custom design allowed it to get an edge over Apple, and this was evident not just in synthetic workloads like Geekbench but real-life usage scenarios.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:975px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.69%;"><img id="UztPZ9XgesNNXiWRx4myQa" name="Apple iPhone 17 Pro thermals" alt="Apple iPhone 17 Pro thermal management highlighted at launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UztPZ9XgesNNXiWRx4myQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="975" height="504" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's no wonder, then, that the A19 Pro addresses this issue. I'll need to get my hands on the iPhone 17 Pro to test how the single and multi-core workloads measure up against what's available on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Qualcomm and MediaTek are set to announce their next-gen platforms soon, and it will be interesting to see what they bring to the table.</p><h2 id="what-about-ai-performance-2">What about AI performance?</h2><p>Another point of differentiation is around AI; the A19 and A19 Pro have Neural Accelerators built into each GPU core designed to deliver up to a 4x increase in compute. Apple is confident enough in its claims that it says the A19 Pro delivers MacBook-level performance when it comes to AI-assisted workloads. That's joined by a new 16-core Neural Engine with increased memory bandwidth.</p><p>Although Apple didn't talk too much about AI at the event, it's evident that all phone manufacturers are pushing to increase on-device AI utilities as they introduce powerful NPUs tailored to handle these tasks. Apple Intelligence has potential, but it still isn't at a point where it measures up to what Google is doing on its phones.</p><p>There's no question that Google has the edge in this area with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>; the phone has a vast suite of meaningful AI utilities, and it continually gets new features, like the image-to-video Veo 3 engine. If anything, AI is foundational to Google's efforts, and the Tensor G5 is designed around the NPU. While the A19 Pro doesn't put as strong an emphasis on the NPU, it's clear that Apple wants to do better in this segment.</p><h2 id="upgrades-to-look-forward-to-2">Upgrades to look forward to</h2><p>With the touted efficiency gains and all the new features coming to the A19 Pro, I'm excited to get my hands on the iPhone 17 Pro models to see how they differ to their predecessors. While we've had several years of similar-looking designs with little increments, the aluminum unibody designs of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max alongside the new internals and tweaks to the imaging make the devices a much more enticing upgrade this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Spotify's vice president of subscriptions, Gustav Gyllenhammar, said, "The wait is finally over; we’re so excited lossless sound is rolling out to Premium subscribers." Those getting into "Lossless Listening" via Spotify Premium today will find music streamed in 24-bit/44.1 kHz FLAC, per its post.</p><p>Spotify states this new streaming method will offer listeners "greater detail" for every song on the platform. New releases and even some of those older tracks that you may have in your favorites are supported by Lossless.</p><p>To activate Lossless, users should tap their <strong>Profile icon in the app > Settings & Privacy> Media Quality > select where to enable Lossless: Wi-Fi, Cellular, or Downloads.</strong></p><p>Spotify says you will have to enable Lossless on every device you have manually. More than that, it's recommended to experience Lossless over Wi-Fi with "wired headphones or speakers or a non-Bluetooth connection." Spotify says the size of streamed Lossless audio is much larger, and Bluetooth signals don't have the capacity to support it at its level of crispiness. After you've listened to a Lossless song once, though, it'll load much faster the second time around.</p><h2 id="lossless-is-here-2">Lossless is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="TVUAbkVAEHBsir4WJUxeVa" name="spotify-lossless-activation-guide" alt="To activate Lossless audio on Spotify, users should head into their Profile and navigate to their Media Quality settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TVUAbkVAEHBsir4WJUxeVa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Premium subscribers can use Lossless audio in their own private playlists and Liked Songs, of course. However, Spotify says this feature extends to features like DJ, AI Playlists, Jam, Mix, and Daylist. It's worth keeping in mind that Spotify's Lossless seems to consume roughly 1GB of data per hour it's playing. Spotify says you can choose your Lossless audio quality to help manage how much data is used.</p><p>Lossless Listening will be available on mobile, desktop, tablets, and devices that support Spotify Connect, like Sony, Bose, Samsung, and Sennheiser. Sonos and Amazon devices will grab support "next month."</p><p>As Lossless makes its way to supported regions, Spotify says it's already appearing for users in the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Austria, Czechia, Denmark, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Sweden. We haven't seen Lossless appear on the mobile app yet, but we did get a splash screen, stating "we'll notify you when it's available."</p><p>We've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/spotifys-lossless-audio-might-be-right-around-the-corner-per-new-evidence">been waiting on Spotify's Lossless audio</a>, which we've seen previously talked about as Hi-Fi (high fidelity), since 2021.

The company calls it the "best iPhone ever" with catchphrases like "it's unlike everything we've ever created," but many of our readers aren't buying it.</p><p>This time around, it's a little different. There were quite a few feature reveals and announcements that made our team at Android Central genuinely impressed, and Android users should take notice.</p><p>From a reimagined front-facing camera sensor that made us ask, "Why hasn't anyone done this before?" to blood pressure monitoring on Apple Watch, these are the Apple event features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">watches</a> should quickly take inspiration from.</p><h2 id="a-square-selfie-camera-2">A square selfie camera</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yiEdrvg5PVxV3hnScAUd3K" name="iPhone-17-Square-Centerstage" alt="The iPhone 17's new square CenterStage camera sensor in action." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yiEdrvg5PVxV3hnScAUd3K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are rarely new iPhone features that make me feel the <em>need</em> to upgrade, but Apple's new front-facing camera sensor on the iPhone 17 is one. The CenterStage camera now uses a square aspect ratio, a deviation from the 4:3 size we usually see on most front-facing smartphone cameras. With a 1:1 aspect ratio, the camera can crop in to provide portrait or landscape shots without the user needing to physically rotate their device.</p><p>If you've tried to hold a big flagship in landscape orientation one-handed while trying to get a group selfie, you'll know why this matters. It's easier to corral your phone in portrait orientation, and you can get the best of both worlds with the redesigned CenterStage camera. A simple tap of the screen will rotate the selfie orientation in software, simplifying the experience.</p><p>CenterStage can also use AI to expand the typical field-of-view to make sure everyone fits inside the photo. The resolution is up to 18MP for photos and 4K HDR for videos, so you don't trade versatility for quality. I want <em>every</em> Android flagship to explore using square sensors next upgrade cycle.</p><h2 id="higher-base-and-max-storage-configurations-2">Higher base and max storage configurations</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5" name="iphone-17-lineup-pricing-breakdown" alt="Apple's iPhone lineup with pricing following iPhone 17 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B5FTjLbvEhkuo7nVgqkeZ5.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">And, Apple did it without raising the base iPhone 17 pricing.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Is 128GB of base storage enough in 2025? We think not, and Apple didn't think so either. It raised the base storage for the iPhone 17 lineup across the board, with its newly announced phones starting at 256GB. Amazingly, even considering tariffs and inflation, Apple didn't raise the price of a single model to deliver higher base storage.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're still waiting for Google and Samsung to take the hint and remove the 128GB storage configuration from their flagship lineups. This year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> all start with just 128GB of storage space.</p><p>Apple also raised the storage ceiling on the iPhone 17 Pro Max. You can now equip the smartphone with up to 2TB of storage. The price is a bit laughable at $2,000, but it is a nice option for people who want to use the "pro" camera system for high-quality video recording formats with extreme storage demands.</p><h2 id="dual-capture-recording-2">Dual Capture recording</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN" name="Apple-iPhone-17-Pro-camera-close-up-250909" alt="Render of iPhone 17 Pro's "camera plateau"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEnQzxsUdkTYNPGfPCMAEN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When Apple does something, it often becomes mainstream. That's what we're hoping to see happen with Dual Capture recording on the iPhone 17 series. It allows users to record both the front- and rear-facing camera views at the same time, which is great for POV-style videos that also provide insight into what the person is actually seeing in their surroundings.</p><p>Samsung actually already offers this feature in the form of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-directors-view-shooting-mode-samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra">Director's View on select Galaxy phone models</a>. With this tool, you can simultaneously record both camera views or switch between them on your Samsung phone. But it's a relatively unknown feature among casual users, and other Android phone brands haven't been quick to borrow it. As such, we would like to see OEMs like Google add options like Dual Capture or Director's View soon.</p><h2 id="blood-pressure-monitoring-2">Blood pressure monitoring</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25" name="Apple-Watch-Series-11-BPM" alt="Blood pressure monitoring on the Apple Watch Series 11." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ngu94MvMgAtT8i8i2x8R25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Watch has featured blood pressure monitoring for years now. However, U.S. availability has become a major hurdle. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> has all the sensors for it, but the brand won't flip on the feature in this region, presumably for regulatory reasons. Well, this is a problem Apple officially solved with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-hypertension-alerts-just-put-every-smartwatch-rival-on-notice">hypertension warnings</a> on the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3.</p><p>It's not replacing medical-grade detection methods, but blood pressure monitoring and hypertension warnings could literally save lives.</p><p>"Hypertension is the leading modifiable risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and kidney disease, and impacts approximately 1.3 billion adults globally," the company explains in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/" target="_blank">press release</a>. "It is frequently undiagnosed because it often has no symptoms, many people do not see a doctor regularly, and even during a clinical visit, it can be easily missed with a single measurement."</p><p>For these reasons, we're thrilled to see Apple Watch support blood pressure monitoring in the U.S., and we want to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> get on board sooner rather than later.</p><h2 id="an-affordable-smartwatch-with-current-specs-2">An affordable smartwatch with current specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="waGwpWjty7Wbnxr3pJGQjN" name="Apple-Watch-SE-3" alt="The Apple Watch SE 3 promo against a gradient background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/waGwpWjty7Wbnxr3pJGQjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Affordable versions of Wear OS smartwatches usually cut quite a few corners to hit an approachable price point. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-fe-vs-galaxy-watch-6">Samsung's Galaxy Watch FE</a>, for example, uses recycled and older hardware to hit an affordable cost. You can always buy older models, like a Galaxy Watch 7 or Pixel Watch 3, but we want something better. Apple's newly announced Apple Watch SE 3 strikes the perfect balance of modern feature set and affordability.</p><p>It costs just $249, and doesn't sacrifice much in terms of hardware. There's the Apple S10 system-in-package (SiP) processor, 5G cellular connectivity, and an always-on display (AOD). Offered in 41mm and 44mm sizes, it's a versatile smartwatch that runs the latest watchOS 26 operating system.</p><p>In fact, the Apple Watch SE 3 supporting 5G is notable because most flagship Wear OS watches are limited to just 4G LTE connectivity. We'd like to see more Android watches adopt 5G, and we'd also like to see better value-oriented wearables on the Wear OS side.</p><h2 id="features-apple-stole-from-android-2">Features Apple "Stole" from Android</h2><p>Apple also "borrowed" a handful of Android features and characteristics, most notably the camera bar, which it's eloquently calling the camera <em>plateau</em>.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For seven years now, most iPhone models have shipped with an OLED display. It was a long-awaited change for some users who had already experienced the punchy colors and inky blacks associated with Android phones that used the technology, and while it enhanced picture quality a lot, it also came with a nasty surprise for some: headaches and eye strain caused by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>.</p><p>This year, Google launched a new accessibility mode that's supposed to help users who find OLEDs more painful than pleasurable, but the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-display-interview">didn't actually do what users needed</a>. Turns out, Apple was also working on a solution, and, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2025/09/09/iphone-17-pro-pwm-toggle/">Mac Rumors</a>, the iPhone 17 family has a new accessibility option that <em>disables</em> PWM dimming entirely.</p><p>The new setting, found under the Display and Text Size section of accessibility settings in iOS 26, reads "<em>Disables pulse width modulation (PWM) to provide a different way to dim the OLED display, which can create a smoother display output at low brightness levels. Disabling PWM may affect low brightness display performance under certain conditions."</em></p><p>Mac Rumors notes that while all iPhone 17 series phones have the new option, they aren't sure if the setting will come to older iPhone or iPad models. We've reached out to Apple for additional information on this new feature and will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-this-is-important-2">Why this is important</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-sensitive-eyes-pwm-accessibility-feature" alt="The new "adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" PWM-adjustment feature on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on the language, it seems that Apple's new accessibility option is likely identical to what Motorola launched back on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a>. That means the phone doesn't use PWM dimming at all. Instead, it'll use DC-like dimming to adjust the brightness of the display, making it significantly more friendly for <em>everyone</em>, not just those of us who suffer from PWM sensitivity.</p><p>We don't yet know the specifics of how the new setting works, but there's a clear difference in the language versus what Google's Pixel 10 Pro family provides. Google's accessibility setting notes that it "adjusts emission frequency" to help sensitive users, but this only doubles the PWM frequency from 240Hz to 480Hz. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">Research shows</a> that PWM dimming needs to occur at a minimum of 3000Hz to help most users, so Google's mode isn't exactly effective.</p><p>Most phones from Chinese brands have offered the ability to either adjust or disable PWM dimming for years, with companies like Honor using up to 4320Hz dimming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">in its latest phones</a>. Since most of these Chinese brands aren't officially available in the US, users who are sensitive to light flicker, like PWM dimming, haven't had an abundance of choice. Notably, the three most popular brands — Apple iPhone, Samsung Galaxy, and Google Pixel — offered <strong>no</strong> relief for these folks until now.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-apple-iphone-16-pro-max-pro-pwm-rate" alt="Comparing the PWM rate of a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL with the sensitive eyes dimming feature enabled to the Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WiwNbaRarAAmV8YZDgwWKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">What PWM dimming looks like on a camera using a fast shutter speed. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This move should help push the entire OLED industry forward and make OLED displays more friendly for all users. I wasn't PWM-sensitive until 2022, and it took me several months to figure out that it was my phone's OLED display <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-phone-is-making-me-sick-and-im-not-alone">causing the issue</a>. Many users don't know that their phones' displays rapidly flicker on and off to control brightness, and likely have no idea it's what's been causing their headaches.</p><p>It's estimated that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://caseorganic.medium.com/the-invisible-light-thats-harming-our-health-and-how-we-can-light-things-better-d3916de90521">up to 20% of the population</a> suffers from some form of flicker sensitivity and likely doesn't realize it. Since the flickering is "invisible" to our eyes, most people don't even know that LEDs and some fluorescent bulbs rapidly turn on and off to manage brightness, but our brains perceive this, and some people are "allergic" to it. Think of it like being allergic to gluten but not knowing that gluten exists. You would constantly experience pain, but not understand the cause since most people around you don't suffer from it.</p><p>By adopting this new accessibility setting, Apple's move will hopefully push Samsung and Google to finally fix their OLED displays and offer all users dimming options that are better for their eyes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

ANC is <strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong>, and it's an electronic means of suppressing outside and ambient noises that may be loud or simply bothersome, like a crowded bus, a crying baby, or an aircraft engine.</p><p>All headphones are noise canceling to some extent because they are either plugged into your ear or cover it. This blocks a good bit of the regular ambient noises in life, but sometimes you need a little more, and that's where ANC comes into play.</p><p>AMC uses sound itself to mute sound. Yes, you read that right. With dedicated microphones and fast microprocessors, you can say goodbye to that noisy jet engine when you're trying to sleep on a midnight flight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ambient-passthrough" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not all headphones or earbuds use electronic noise cancellation, and you'll notice the brands and models that do will cost a little more. The parts and engineering needed aren't crazy expensive, but they will add to the cost.</p><p>Additionally, some individuals cannot use headphones with any form of electronic noise suppression. I know because, unfortunately, I'm one of them. Just like a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">phone screen causes trouble</a> for some people, the method used to suppress noises can cause a terrible headache, and some people say they can even <em>hear</em> it. Thankfully, most people are unaffected, and headphones with ANC are quite popular and easy to find.</p><h2 id="so-how-does-anc-work-2">So how does ANC work?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1195px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="5fVKr7JgUEkWVmi5HqHbsY" name="soundform" alt="A sound waveform mock-up." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fVKr7JgUEkWVmi5HqHbsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1195" height="672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The way ANC works is super cool and almost seems like some sort of secret dark magic. It's not, of course: it's pure science that's not even hard to do thanks to the way sound "works".</p><p>All sound is expressed as a sound wave. The simple diagram above gives you an idea of what I'm talking about, and you've likely seen something similar when discussing sound.</p><p>Wave is a good term because you'll find crests and valleys, just as you would on a series of waves in the ocean. The distance between the "top" of the crest and the "bottom" of the valley is called the <em>amplitude</em>, and an easy way to think about it is that it determines how loud a particular portion of the sound will be. The distance between the crests is called the <em>frequency</em>. A larger number indicates a higher frequency, which means that portion of the sound is in a higher pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FTu2kqVG4sgkoqRJc7pFCJ" name="astell-and-kern-activo-p1-UI-peq-q-factor.JPG" alt="Astell & Kern Activo P1 showing 20-band parametric equalizer Q-factor adjustiment" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTu2kqVG4sgkoqRJc7pFCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most important part is that <strong>this is a constant</strong>. Different sounds will create different sound waves, but frequency and amplitude are always measurable. A computer can get exact readings of all this information, and it uses it to cancel annoying noises, combined with a good microphone and a noise-generation device of some sort. Yes, you really use noise to get rid of noise.</p><p>Let's go back to the diagram for a minute. The black line is what we'll call the zero point. The red line is the noise you don't want to hear. The blue line is what is created when a computer analyzes the red wave and recreates it.</p><p>That sound, which should be an exact copy of the noise you're trying to get rid of, is played at 180 degrees out of phase (think of it as being flipped on its head). The blue wave crests when the red wave dips in perfect harmony. This creates what's known as <em>destructive interference</em>.</p><p>When the amplitude and frequency of the red wave are matched in reverse by the blue wave, the total amplitude is zero. Think of a crest as +5, and a valley as -5. When you subtract 5 from 5, you're left with nothing. A zero amplitude, zero frequency tone is no tone at all - dead silence.</p><p>Because nothing is ever perfect, the waveforms won't be exactly 180 degrees out of phase consistently. This can cause a small, barely audible humming noise. You might have heard this from time to time if you use headphones with ANC, and it's what gives some people a fit when trying to use them.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="bKzgByJ6DRDDqRCseXh5rY" name="" alt="Marshall Monitor III ANC headphones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKzgByJ6DRDDqRCseXh5rY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="1728" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">headphones or earbuds with ANC</a> have microphones that don't listen to whatever is coming through the headphones themselves. Instead, they are listening to the outside noise.</p><p>Using the waveform of <strong>only</strong> the outside noise and doing this bit of science on it makes it seem like it has gone away while leaving what you want to hear alone. Some headphone and earbud models have a way to turn ANC off and use the dedicated microphones to playback outside noise, and when you hear people talk about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review">audio passthrough</a>, that's what is happening.</p><p>You don't need to know any of this to enjoy noise-free listening, but it's always fun to know how something so cool and seemingly complicated really works.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The Pixel 10 Pro is easily one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> released in 2025 so far, and this surprise deal makes the AI-boosted smartphone dirt cheap. </p><p>If you don't need this much power, it's also worth noting that <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>T-Mobile is offering the same $800 discount on the base model Pixel 10</strong>,</a> effectively making that phone completely free with an eligible line. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a2a29269-e913-4f82-8373-2c6998a4e0c7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> was announced alongside the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup during a Made by Google event on August 20th. The phone is powered by the super-efficient Tensor G5 processor and comes with a gorgeous 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, 16GB of RAM, and 25W Qi2 magnetic charging (which is a rarity for Android devices). </p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro also boasts all of the AI-boosted camera features we&apos;ve come to expect from the OEM, plus I&apos;ve been enjoying the upgraded gaming performance (not to mention seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed, but that&apos;s pretty standard these days). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro">Compared to last year&apos;s Pixel 9 Pro</a>, you&apos;ll also see some improvements in battery life and Android 16 right out of the box. </p><p>If I had to nitpick some flaws in the device, I&apos;d say that removing physical SIM support from the Pixel 10 series was a bad move, and 128GB of base storage also feels like a strange decision in this day and age. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM rate</a> is still bad if you&apos;re sensitive to that, and I&apos;m not sure if the Tensor G5 can match the performance of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Again, this is all pretty nitpicky stuff, and if you&apos;re already a fan of Pixel devices, the Pixel 10 Pro is a no-brainer. There are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">plenty of offers</a> that can make the $999.99 flagship much cheaper (or even free), but if you want a straightforward carrier promotion that doesn&apos;t require a trade-in, T-Mobile&apos;s Pixel 10 Pro deal has the competition beat. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Back in 2020, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/qualcomm-quick-charge-5">Quick Charge 5 set the pace with over 100W of power</a>, which was enough to take a device from zero to 50% in about five minutes.</p><p>Now, Qualcomm says Quick Charge 5+ maintains the same fast performance while directly addressing the heat issues common with high-voltage charging.</p><h2 id="smarter-power-delivery-2">Smarter power delivery</h2><p>The upgrade adjusts voltage and current on the go, using up to 20V at 7A to deliver power with less heat buildup. This means your device can stay at top speeds for longer without throttling or cooking your battery.</p><p>Qualcomm also claims this will help extend battery life and keep performance steady even during demanding tasks like gaming or streaming.</p><p>Efficiency is another big focus. Quick Charge 5+ identifies what kind of device it’s plugged into and optimizes power delivery, which not only wastes less energy but could also lower costs for manufacturers.</p><p>Compared to other solutions that crank up voltage just to hit big wattage numbers, the new iteration takes a more balanced approach that avoids unnecessary heat and inefficiency.</p><h2 id="it-plays-well-with-others-2">It plays well with others</h2><p>Compatibility shouldn’t be an issue either. Quick Charge 5+ works with older Quick Charge gear (back to 2.0) and will play nice with upcoming devices set to debut at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomms-next-powerful-chip-gets-a-launch-date-in-september">Snapdragon Summit 2025 later this month</a>.</p><p>And you don’t need a Snapdragon-powered device to benefit, as it’s designed to match competitor chargers on non-Qualcomm hardware too. Accessories using the new standard are expected to start shipping later this year.</p><p>With Quick Charge 5+, Qualcomm wants to make fast charging more practical for real-world use. Cooler operation, smarter power handling, and broad compatibility could make this the go-to option for the next wave of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones</a> and laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's not direct blood pressure monitoring, but that almost makes Apple's new system more compelling — and rival brands will be scrambling to emulate it.</p><p>Users in Europe or Asia can get smartwatch-based blood pressure tracking with a Huawei Watch D2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> (with a cuff). But unless you're aware of chronic high blood pressure issues, you may not take advantage of this tool often. And a smartwatch won't replace a medical-grade blood pressure monitor.</p><p>I won't downplay the usefulness of convenient, on-the-go smartwatch BP checks for anyone unwilling to go to a doctor. But since Samsung has never gotten FDA approval — and several clinical studies with Galaxy Watches showed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"insufficient accuracy"</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40486128/">"substantial pre-post calibration BP difference"</a> — it's not something I'd actively recommend to at-risk relatives, even if I could.</p><p>Samsung also has a newer, indirect method of predicting hypertension — its Vascular Load stat — but it's not as straightforward as Apple's method, which will come to "more than 150 countries and regions," including the U.S. and EU this month, and pass FDA clearance "soon."</p><p>Once it does, I could see the Apple Watch Series 11 becoming even more popular than past models. Anyone in an at-risk age group, or whose family is predisposed to chronic high blood pressure, will want these early warning signs.</p><h2 id="apple-found-a-depressingly-common-condition-to-predict-2">Apple found a depressingly common condition to predict</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE" name="apple-hypertension-alert" alt="A render of the Apple Watch Series 11 showing a "possible hypertension" pop-up, with an iPhone next to it showing more details on "patterns related to hypertension" from the last 30 days of heart data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RG4gXxFEJpkb65WjNxphKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/high-blood-pressure/data-research/facts-stats/index.html">CDC</a> reports that 119.9 million American adults, or 48.1%, suffer from hypertension, while only 27 million have their condition "under control." 34 million Americans with hypertension had yet to fill or start taking their prescriptions. And "1 in 5 adults with high blood pressure is unaware of it and would not report having it."</p><p>Hypertension was a "primary or contributing cause of 664,470 deaths" in the United States in 2023, primarily from heart attack, heart failure, or stroke. Worldwide, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hypertension">WHO</a> estimates 1.28 billion people have hypertension, with only 42% "diagnosed and treated."</p><p>These numbers speak for themselves. Chronic high blood pressure is painfully common, and the people with it either aren't aware or aren't willing to treat themselves, whether due to financial concerns or because they're otherwise healthy and assume they don't need to worry.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE" name="apple-watch-series-11-hypertension" alt="A render of two Apple Watch Series 11 models, one showing a Sleep Score, the other showing a "Possible Hypertension" alert." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SggiVocSr5YPnLp7kA4GSE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For something like sleep apnea or AFib, a smartwatch alert is obviously useful, but at least these conditions have physical symptoms that you could detect on your own. With hypertension, Apple correctly notes in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/09/apple-debuts-apple-watch-series-11-featuring-groundbreaking-health-insights/">press release</a>, it "often has no symptoms" and "can be easily missed" if you only get readings once a year at the doctor's office.</p><p>Apple used "training data from multiple studies totaling over 100,000 participants," synced up against a "clinical study of over 2,000 participants," to make its machine learning algorithm. It'll then compare 30 days of optical HR data against its own data to spot any warning signs.</p><p>Apple predicts that out of the millions of users with an Apple Watch S9, S10, S11, Ultra 2, or Ultra 3, it'll spot signs of hypertension in a million people "within the first year."</p><p>That could very well prove hyperbolic, and I'll side-eye Apple if the FDA takes long to validate the feature. However, I'm truly optimistic that this could end up being a widespread tool, building awareness for a pervasive and dangerous condition. Regardless of which smartwatch brand you're a fan of, that's a great thing.</p><h2 id="android-and-fitness-watches-have-their-own-life-saving-tools-2">Android and fitness watches have their own life-saving tools</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ" name="One-UI-8-Vascular-Load" alt="One UI 8 Watch health features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/brT4uihzszeAu99JDP24yQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone who wears a Galaxy Watch 8,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review"> Watch 8 Classic</a>, or Watch Ultra 24/7 will get Samsung's Vascular Load data, which takes your sleep data and "measures blood volume and vascular stiffness and precisely analyzes changes in stress on blood vessels."</p><p>Arterial stiffness is one potential sign of hypertension, among other heart conditions. But Samsung's Vascular Load graph is more about pointing out how lifestyle choices like sodium intake or drinking cause heart strain in the short term, and while that's valid, it also puts the onus on the user to get better scores when the true cause might be genetic. Plus, it focuses on sleep strain, not necessarily strain during the day.</p><p>I think Samsung could end up launching something more targeted to hypertension in the future, based on the data it collects now, and it <em>should</em>. Hopefully, other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> brands will follow suit eventually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ" name="google-pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse.jpg" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 is the first Google device to feature the Loss of Pulse feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U89JsJt5Bp2E3WzGdLGuzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1900" height="1069" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for other life-saving smartwatch tricks, the most obvious one is Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/how-enable-loss-of-pulse-detection-google-pixel-watch">Loss of Pulse detection</a>, which contacts emergency services during cardiac arrest or other major heart issues. If no one is around to report it, this could save your life, though it's obviously a last resort for someone with unresolved health issues.</p><p>On the preventative front, Samsung, Google/Fitbit, Withings, and Apple offer passive irregular heart rhythm warnings. More brands offer ECGs for active AFib data, but you may not use them after getting one "normal" sinus reading; passive data is vital for making more people aware they should check their heart regularly, just like hypertension alerts point people toward using a BP machine.</p><p>It's clearer than ever that we're entering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical era of wearables</a>. Samsung is offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">virtual doctor visits and prescription management</a>, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> adds better temperature sensors to catch people "falling under the weather."</p><p>Apple's hypertension alerts are just the latest strike in this battle, but it's an impressive one. Knowing if you or loved ones are at risk for stroke, heart failure, or other conditions will intrigue a lot of people.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Apple might not realize it, there is a world outside of the walled gardens in Cupertino, and we spotted a few things that Apple "stole" from Android during the event.</p><p>However, we have to admit, compared to years past, this list is a lot lighter than we expected. Usually, we can stick to the confines of the iPhone, but this year, we had to broaden the horizon a bit more.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-thin-phone-2">An ultra thin phone</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can file this in the category of "what's the point," but the iPhone Air was officially introduced, a phone that's just 5.6mm thin.

Unfortunately, it's not the kind of update you'd want to hear, as a new leak suggests the Galaxy S26 Ultra may take a step back with its 3x telephoto zoom camera.</p><p>Earlier reports indicated that Samsung might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">switch to a new 12MP sensor</a> for the 3x telephoto zoom on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Many assumed this would mean crisper zoom and close-up shots. However, according to reliable tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1965598697519198438">Ice Universe</a>, Samsung will crop the 12MP down to just 10MP on the new sensor.</p><p>The leaker claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra will use only 10MP (of the 12MP available) with an f/2.4 aperture, a 1/3.94" sensor size, and 1.0μm pixels. While this may sound similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which also used a 10MP 3x telephoto sensor, it could result in a downgraded experience overall.</p><h2 id="smaller-pixels-may-hurt-low-light-performance-2">Smaller pixels may hurt low-light performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-angled-view-face-down-1" alt="Angled view of the Galaxy S25 Ultra face-down" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ossRtP7zanZnrXu8WcpxKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To break it down, the Galaxy S25 Ultra had a 1/3.53" 10MP sensor with 1.12μm pixel size. The Galaxy S26 Ultra may use a larger sensor, but with smaller 1.0μm pixels. For reference, the pixel size determines how much light is captured — the larger the number, the more light and typically the better the photos.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> scaling back to smaller pixels, the new sensor could let in less light than its predecessor, leading to weaker 3x shots in low-light conditions.</p><p>Of course, Samsung could offset this with software optimizations and an improved ISP, but based purely on hardware, it looks like we may be in for a slight downgrade on the next Ultra flagship.</p><p>Past rumors about the Galaxy S26 Ultra suggest the phone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">keep the S Pen</a>, adopt a slimmer build, and support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">faster 60W charging</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-5420766087977553015&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2Fpcmcat1563302848653.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_us_1362924355208326874&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1943169%2F565706%2F9383%3FsubId1%3Dac-us-4792126853743754287%26sharedId%3Dac-us%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.walmart.com%252Fcp%252Fcell-phones%252F1105910%253Fpovid%253Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel%2Fway-to-get-pixel-10-with-physical-sim-in-us" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://shop-links.co/link?publisher_slug=future&exclusive=1&u1=ac-us-8840006662694302210&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F&article_name=One%20UI%208%20is%20nearly%20ready%20for%20the%20Galaxy%20S25%2C%20with%20a%20fifth%20beta%20now%20rolling%20out&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy%2Fone-ui-8-beta-5-for-samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1187103296997437100-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-1015660682400264613&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1026776483449387902&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
