<p>Looks like the wait for One UI 7 for people in the U.S. got longer— by three days.</p><p>While we recently learned that One UI 7 is finally arriving on Galaxy phones in the second week of April, users in the U.S., however, have to wait a couple of more days.</p><p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/">announcement post</a>, Samsung has confirmed that the Galaxy S24 series, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and the Z Flip 6 will be getting the Android 15-based update on April 10. It makes it three days behind the global release, which is<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7"> slated for April 7</a>.</p>

<p>While the reason behind the delay is unspecified, it isn’t that alarming as it is just a matter of days — and it still makes the rollout of the One UI 7 within the same week.</p><p>Other than the devices mentioned above, older devices like the Galaxy S23 series, S24 FE, S23 FE, Galaxy Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, and tablets like Galaxy Tab S10 and Tab S9 series will be receiving the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based update in the following weeks after the April 7 and April 10 rollouts in the corresponding regions.</p><p>Yes, the One UI 7 rollout has been significantly delayed when compared to the previous iteration rollout. While many anticipated that it would be happening alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series launch back in January, it didn’t happen, and the Korean tech giant continued rolling out the One UI 7 beta updates for the Galaxy S24 models.</p>

<ul><li>Google is taking a cue from OpenAI and making Gemini available to access without an account.</li><li>You can now use Gemini on the web without signing into your Google account for added privacy.</li><li>Some Gemini features are limited or unavailable, like chat history and file uploads.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is making a slight tweak to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> that will make it more like OpenAI's ChatGPT — users can now access the Gemini web client without a Google account. While not every feature is available if you use Gemini without signing in, the new functionality makes it possible to get help from Google's chatbot without tying that data to you. The tweak is only available via the web client, not the mobile apps, and was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/gemini-no-sign-in/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>Now that Google has dropped the account requirement for Gemini, navigating to the Gemini web client will bring new users straight to the chat page instead of the sign-in page. Of course, if you are signed into a Google account in your browser already, the Gemini web client will attempt to automatically sign you in. As such, opening a private browsing window may be the easiest way to use Gemini independently from your Google account.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="q9NJvkxraFSUGKNUVZ6QjY" name="Gemini-Web-No-Account" alt="The Gemini web client being used without signing in." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9NJvkxraFSUGKNUVZ6QjY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3406" height="1854" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest limitation that comes with using Gemini without an account is being restricted to just the Gemini 2.0 Flash model. All the other models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking (experimental), Gemini Deep Research, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wants-to-use-your-search-history-to-personalize-gemini-responses">Gemini Personalization (experimental)</a>, require you to sign in to access them. This isn't exactly surprising, since some of these models are locked behind Gemini Advanced and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium subscription</a>.</p><p>If you try to click one of the other models without signing in, you'll be shown the following message: "Sign in to explore the newest Gemini models." Other limitations include being unable to save and view your chat history, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-adds-document-upload-and-analysis-for-free-users">the lack of file upload support</a>.</p><p>For now, it appears the Gemini mobile app on iOS and Android still requires a Google account for chatbot access.</p>

<hr>
<p>Verizon announces a major update for its customers and a select group of smartphones today (Mar. 19).</p><p>The cellular service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-customers-satellite-texting-select-android-smartphones">announced</a> it is bringing satellite texting to any device via "select" Android phones in a press release. According to Verizon, its U.S.-based customers will be the first in the nation to receive such support. The company states users can "send text messages to any other customer device via satellite when outside the reach of terrestrial cellular networks."</p><p>There is some restriction here as Verizon states this satellite capability won't hit <em>every </em>Android phone. Users with a Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25</a> or Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9 series</a> phone can leverage its newly expanded satellite texting.</p><p>Verizon is starting to hammer away at these upgrades today (Mar. 19); however, it will likely take two weeks before it's completely stable and ready.</p><p>Verizon's EVP & president, Global Network and Technology, Joe Russo, said in a statement, "This expansion of satellite texting capabilities is a testament to our commitment to ensure customers stay connected wherever they are."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="v9y8kdjp3xdE2NNNtQMV9i" name="verizon-sign-storefront.jpg" alt="Verizon logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9y8kdjp3xdE2NNNtQMV9i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Curiously, it's unclear whether or not this satellite texting capability includes the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a>. There is no information from Verizon nor Google on this matter. Android Central has reached out to Google about this matter and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">Pixel 9a launched today</a> (Mar. 19) with a fresh new look that forgoes that thick camera bump we've become accustomed to. The phone features a battery life of up to 30 hours and rapid charging support. For $499, the Pixel 9a contains Google's latest AI features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Add Me, and more.</p><p>In other news, Google mentioned briefly about the Pixel 9 series joining Verizon's satellite messaging services during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">its March feature drop</a>. It seems things are finally in a spot where both sides can move forward and begin bringing it to consumers. Additionally, Verizon highlights its work to expand and improve the usefulness of satellite communications — such as its usage for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-and-at-and-t-are-testing-satellite-based-video-calls-and-its-not-starlink">satellite-based video calls</a>.</p><p>In late February, Verizon joined AT&T in testing the first satellite-to-phone video calls using the BlueBird satellite from AST SpaceMobile. Verizon announced the test saw it placing its first-ever satellite call through this method. AST SpaceMobile said it was rolling out an on-demand direct-to-device service in the U.S. This is said to leverage Verizon and AT&T's 850MHz spectrum due to its close relation with smartphones.</p><p>There appears to be some optimism regarding satellite-based video calls; however, more testing is still required before civilians can partake.</p>

<ul><li>European Commission's preliminary findings show that Google fails to comply with the Digital Markets Act (DMA) on two of its major products.</li><li>Google Search page and Google Play Store seem to be favoring the tech giant's products above all the other competitors in the market.</li><li>Google responds to this by stating that, the DMA "will hurt European businesses and consumers, hinder innovation, weaken security, and degrade product quality."</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earlier today (Mar. 19), the EU Commission published its preliminary findings stating that two of Google's most used products are in breach of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a> (DMA).</p><p>The DMA is a legislation brought about by the European Union to regulate big tech companies to make sure they're playing fair and following practices that don't favor their products over other big players on the market— leveling the playing field for other tech companies.</p><p>This Act applies to large tech giants such as Alphabet(Google's parent company), Apple, and Microsoft among others. And Google has been dealing with the heat of the EU, since March 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_811">report suggests </a>that Google Search, "self preferences" its products over others i.e., when a user searches for anything related to shopping, hotel booking, transport, or financial and sports results,<strong> </strong>the report claims that Google shows its products at the top of the results page, rather than similar services offered by third parties— making users gravitate to its websites more often. More specifically "Alphabet<strong> </strong>gives its services more prominent treatment compared to others," the report stated.</p>

<p>Secondly, the EU Commission states that Under the DMA, app developers that showcase and distribute their apps via the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play"> Google Play Store</a> should be allowed to steer customers to cheaper options other than the ones Google controls.</p><p>"Whilst Alphabet can receive a fee for facilitating the initial acquisition of a new customer by an app developer via Google Play, the fees charged by Alphabet go beyond what is justified."<strong> </strong></p><p>"Alphabet charges developers a high fee over an unduly long period of time for every purchase of digital goods and services," the report claimed.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5" name="top-charts-play-store-s25-ultra" alt="Top Charts in the Play Store on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this isn't the EU's final decision, these preliminary findings were enough to make Google look like they're in breach of the DMA. Responding to this report, Google stated in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/the-eus-competition-rules-are-hurting-consumers-and-businesses/">blog post</a> earlier today that, while the DMA aims at being fair to all players in the market, these rules are "having the opposite effect by hurting European businesses and consumers."</p><p>Furthermore, Google says that if the DMA is enacted, on Google Search, those rules will make it harder for people to find the exact business/website they're looking for— in turn impacting European businesses that rely on this traffic.</p><p>"Users are so frustrated that many are resorting to clunky workarounds to get to the companies and information that they want," Google added.</p><p>Let's not forget that Google did make some changes to Google Search to comply with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-may-become-less-useful-for-trip-planning-thanks-to-the-dma">DMA back in November 2024</a>, it tested removing advanced hotel-booking features entirely in Germany, Belgium, and Estonia for a limited time.</p><p>"Those changes, and many more that we have had to make in Europe, are already causing European businesses to lose up to 30% of traffic," the tech giant explained.</p><p>Speaking about the accusations on Google Play Store, the company says that the Commission's findings on Android and Play "create a false choice between openness and security. They risk exposing people in Europe to more malware and fraud." Since Google allows developers to distribute their apps freely onto the app store, this also creates an open playground for scammers to seep in, without any control from the company.</p><p>Now the only option that Google has is to create a more closed model, much like Apple where the company reviews all the apps that go through the store, without leaving it to the developers.</p><p>That said, since this isn't the final result of the investigation, the tech giant still has time to discuss with the EU Commission and look at options that will favor both parties.</p><p>"We will keep engaging with the Commission and comply with its rules. But today’s findings now increase the risk of an even worse experience for Europeans," Google added.</p>

<hr>
<p>Qualcomm's current generation of smartphone and tablet chips, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite has been incredibly successful. Using the company's own custom Oryon cores, phones with Snapdragon 8 Elite chips inside are significantly faster than their predecessors. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processors</a> are also quite expensive, and that's why a more affordable variant is on the horizon.</p><p>According to reputable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1902269621266255889" target="_blank">Yogesh Brar on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the affordable chipset — named Snapdragon 8s Elite — will start appearing in phones starting next month. Brar claims that there will be "plenty of phones sporting it" and that the initial wave of Snapdragon 8s Elite devices will "first launch in April."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snapdragon 8s Elite is set to launch soon

Plenty of phones sporting it, first launch in April

What are your expectations with the new SoC?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902269621266255889">March 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This update from Brar contradicts a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/heyitsyogesh/status/1863520728752009380" target="_blank">previous claim</a> that said the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8s Elite would launch in March 2025. This leak, posted in December 2024, also claimed that the chip would be based on ARM, instead of the custom Oryon cores used in Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite and Snapdragon X lineups. If this is the case, the Snapdragon 8s Elite chip could perform closer in line to older Snapdragon chips rather than the newer, Oryon-based SoCs.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/snapdragon-8s-elite-launch-soon-3536617/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, citing a January 2025 leak, notes that the Snapdragon 8s Elite could perform better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a> and worse than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, with performance sitting somewhere in the middle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the breakdown of cores inside the Snapdragon 8s Elite processor, the January 2025 leak predicts that the chip will include eight total cores. Of those cores, there could be a big Cortex-X4 with a clock speed of 3.21GHz, paired with three performance Cortex-A720 cores clocked at 3.01GHz. The rest of the cores might be efficiency cores, including two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two more unnamed 2.02GHz cores.</p><p>Of course, this is all speculation until Qualcomm or its partner OEMs officially confirm the Snapdragon 8s Elite chipset and its specs.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has published a new support document to help its Pixel phone owners with an annoying, but easy-to-fix problem (hopefully).</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/16048560#zippy=%2Cpixel-pro-xl%2Cpixel-pro%2Cpixel">recently updated</a> its certified screen protectors document with information on which are best for the Pixel 9 series. While many users search for the best ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">protect their devices</a> from <em>physical </em>harm, some items can hinder the performance of the display. Google says it's "Made for Google screen protectors are tested to ensure compatibility with Pixel phones."</p><p>Certain non-certified screen protectors can mess with the Fingerprint Unlock method, causing recurring failures.</p><p>Google says users looking to purchase a certified screen protector for its Pixel 9 series must ensure there are no air bubbles when applying. This may cause additional problems with the fingerprint sensor. Moreover, Google advises users to wait to setup Fingerprint Unlock until <em>after </em>the screen protector has been applied. In short, this is said to "help the sensor recognize you."</p><p>Below is a complete list of screen protector brands and product SKUs that are certified to work with the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p>
<ul><li>BigBen: FGMGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: FGOGPIXEL9PORIG</li><li>BigBen: PEGLASSPIXEL9P</li><li>Case-Mate: CM053810</li><li>Cesium (Blu Element): 118-2737</li><li>Mous: TEM-A0825-CLRGLS-000-W1</li><li>OtterBox: 77-95656</li><li>Power Support: GPCK-22(SB-A080-GAGG/SMFG)</li><li>Spigen: AGL08445</li><li>Caseology: AGL08497</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114439</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200314517</li><li>Zagg/Mophie: 200114443</li></ul>

<p>The Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro see the same supported/certified brands; however, the product SKUs differ. Consumers should look for Spigen (AGL08442), Caseology (AGL08496), and Zagg/Morphie (200114438, 200314516, and 200114442).</p><p>While these have been "tested" and "certified," Google says there's still a chance Fingerprint Unlock might have an off day. If issues persist even with one of these products, the company suggests you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/13537318#re-enroll_fingerprint">re-enroll</a> your fingerprint or switch over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/14853136">Face Unlock</a>, instead.</p><p>If you're looking for something for your Pixel 9 Pro Fold, there's a compiled list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-screen-protectors">best screen protectors</a> — which might interest you.</p><p>Meanwhile, earlier this month, Google rolled out its huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> for Pixels. There was quite a bit available for phones, such as scam detection measures for the Messages and Phone app. Google also expanded its Satellite SOS feature to more places like Europe and Canada.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nearly a week after rolling out the platform-stable Android 16 Beta 3 update, Google is fixing a few issues with a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 3.1 patch. As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available/" target="_blank">announced</a> on the Android Beta Program subreddit, this update is becoming available for enrolled devices now and carries a version number of <strong>BP22.250221.013</strong>. Android 16 Beta 3.1 does not include any new features, but rather includes four critical fixes, two of which that were reported by beta testers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank">Google's Issue Tracker</a>.</p><p>Among the issues fixed, the biggest one might be a problem that caused the system Settings app to crash under specific circumstances. Reported under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/403303683" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #403303683</u></a>, this problem caused repeated Settings crashes when a device's language was set to something other than English.</p><p>Another problem caused the screen brightness of devices running Android 16 Beta 3 to switch between app-specified brightness levels and system brightness levels. This bug was reported via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/392522561" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Issue #392522561</u></a>, and has been fixed in Android 16 Beta 3.1.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jeem4k/android_16_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Android 16 Beta 3.1 also includes fixes for two issues causing performance problems on devices enrolled in the Android beta. One problem resulted in excessive battery drain due to high CPU load, and another occasionally caused memory leaks in the system server, according to Google.</p><p>The update features all the changes and new capabilities introduced with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">the initial Android 16 Beta 3 release</a>, which marked the first time Android 16 reached platform stability. That includes Auracast support for wireless hearing aids and accessibility features for people with low vision.</p>

<ul><li>Google was spotted rolling out its Wear OS 5.1 update for its LTE Pixel Watches.</li><li>The update is two weeks late for the LTE variants, but it brings a wealth of features like Loss of Pulse, Menstrual Cycle tracking, new media controls, and more.</li><li>Google's Wear OS 5.1 update seemingly marks a new era for the company and how it will update its the wearable software moving forward.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly rolling out its latest Wear OS update to its Pixel Watch series again, but this time it concerns a specific subset of consumers.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/pixel-watch-lte-wear-os-5-1-update/">9to5Google</a> post highlights the sudden appearance of the Wear OS 5.1 update rolling out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Pixel Watch 2, and the original Pixel Watch. The OTA (over-the-air) updates are reportedly coming online for owners of the LTE variants of these Pixel Watches since they were strangely left out of the Wear OS update earlier this month.</p><p>Google has posted the information regarding the update on its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/android/ota-watch">Full OTA Images</a>" page for the Pixel Watch series. According to the company, The LTE Pixel Watch 3 will see version BP1A.250305.019.W3 with the Wear OS 5.1 update. The LTE Pixel Watch 2 will see the same while the O.G. device will see version BP1A.250305.019.W2.</p><p>The OTA's availability seemingly surfaced late in the day yesterday (Mar. 18). Owners of an LTE Pixel Watch 3, 2, or 1 can begin checking for the Wear OS update today. However, it might not be widespread just yet, so continue to check as we wind down the week.</p>

<p>You may remember Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> rolled out at the beginning of the month, and with came the Wear OS 5.1 update. The company dedicated a Pixel Watch-specific section that patch, with the headliner being the Loss of Pulse feature. Only for the Pixel Watch 3, Loss of Pulse will have your device automatically call emergency services if it does not detect your heartbeat and reach you for confirmation.</p><p>Of course, Google had to receive strong <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">approval from the FDA</a> for such a feature, which was delivered in February.</p><p>The other side of the Wear OS 5.1 update is Menstrual Cycle tracking on the Pixel Watch 3. Google states users can now log their periods, view cycle status, and see a "prediction" for the next one. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/328790190/google-pixel-watch-update-march-2025?hl=en&sjid=395091567840875735-NA">patch notes</a> detail some other additions, such as an update to Pixel Watch media controls. It states the update makes it easier "to control audio content from the watch with control types based on content being played."</p><p>Counting steps has become a little more precise with this update alongside an expansion of automatic bedtime mode for the Pixel Watch 2.</p><p>However, with Wear OS 5.1 now out, we're starting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-1-kicks-off-new-update-strategy-for-pixel-watches">enter a new era of updates</a> from Google, which will be slower (quarterly), but more substantial.</p>

<p>Smartwatches have tracked sleep for years, but as we see more sleep coaching, energy scores, sleep apnea detection, and general AI analysis, it's fair to question how accurate a Pixel Watch's data is compared to, say, a polysomnogram or actigraphy watch.</p><p>So I sat down with Dr. Logan Schneider — an associate professor at Stanford University and Google's clinical lead for sleep health — and had a frank discussion about the usefulness, limits, and future of smartwatch sleep tracking.</p><p>Google frequently enlists practicing doctors to work with its engineers on health and wellness features. Earlier this month, I previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">interviewed Google's clinical lead of heart health</a>, Dr. Shreibati, about Loss of Pulse and how smartwatches will eventually deliver "personalized" diagnoses for heart conditions.</p><p>In this case, Dr. Schneider, who worked on projects like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sleep-profile-launch">animal-themed sleep profiles on Fitbits</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-new-sleep-features">Soli-powered sleep tracking on the Nest Hub</a>, had plenty of insights about how clinically useful these kinds of consumer-tech devices can be compared to medical-grade tech.</p>

<h2 id="the-science-behind-smartwatch-sleep-tracking-2">The science behind smartwatch sleep tracking</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-sleep-summary.jpeg" alt="Sleep score tile on the Google Pixel Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vapE6ZGNhbBcAh2eGhWqm9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to studying sleep patterns on an individual or population level, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ucsfhealth.org/medical-tests/polysomnography">polysomnograms</a> are "impractically expensive, time-consuming, and resource intensive," says Dr. Schneider.</p><p>A smartwatch is physically incapable of tracking brain waves (EEGs), eye movement, and some full-body motions that a clinical sleep study can detect. However, it does capture enough useful data to extrapolate the essentials without getting health insurance involved.</p><p>That's why Schneider saw the advent of smartwatches as an opportunity to "understand sleep in a novel way, looking at population health, looking at real world changes in sleep over time," and began reaching out to tech companies like Google. Smartwatches fill a niche that polysomnograms can't.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>You can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I asked Dr. Schneider to give a clinical run-down of how sleep tracking works. He explained how your "body's physiology and its state of motion versus immobility recapitulates what's going on in the brain" and how they can determine your "rest and digest" or "fight or flight" states as a reflection of your brain states.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-sleep-sensing-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Nest Hub (2nd Gen)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VGDMFhFWcEZEZXhY2oWAYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Dr. Schneider helped convert this smart display into a sleep tracker </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Heart rate is an obvious tool for sleep stage approximation, but he put even more emphasis on movement tracking as a vital tool. The inactivity of deep sleep, twitchy paralysis of REM, and more frequent movement in light sleep can all be estimated by your watch's accelerometer.</p><p>False-positive movements — like when your partner shifts the bed while you're in deep sleep — can be one of the big factors when your watch gets sleep estimates wrong. That's why Schneider remains proud of their work taking the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-2nd-gen-review">Nest Hub</a>'s Soli radar and turning it  into a "full body actigraph and cardiopulmonary physiology sensor that could stage sleep quite accurately" because it gets a wider view of your body.</p><p>Ultimately, Schneider believes, smartwatches "can only get so good until you're literally starting to look at the brain waves."</p>

<p>I asked Dr. Schneider what, if anything, could make smartwatch sleep data better <em>without</em> EEG tech. He argued there probably isn't some "gold signal" that makes things perfect, but that isn't strictly necessary.</p><p>The main key for accuracy, he explained, is having "redundant signals." Neurologists looking for a brain issue don't go straight for the MRI or scalpel; they might test your muscular reflexes to catch a "dysfunction" first. Since there are "several different types of redundant signals of the autonomic nervous system," smartwatch brands can look at those secondary sources and get more reliable results.</p><p>We already see that with factors like heart rate variability (HRV), breathing rate, and skin temperature, as secondary information for whether your body is "normal" or if something is trending wrong.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>There's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One potentially new smartwatch metric Schneider brought up was "galvanic skin response." Essentially, if you look at your skin's sweat creation and salt content, you can determine your body's sympathetic nervous system (SNS) response and see, for instance, when your sleep state is unstable.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-2-review">Fitbit Sense 2</a> have a cEDA sensor that looks at sweat levels on your skin, primarily for stress detection. That seems like a perfect fit for using sweat levels to improve sleep accuracy, but I didn't think to ask about this during the interview. Maybe we'll see this in the future!</p><p>But ultimately, it comes back to Google's PPG. He credited Google's engineers for "optimizing the signal acquisition and quality," as well as the multi-path optical sensor that ensures reliable, continuous data that approaches what you'd get from a "gold standard polysomnogram."</p><p>For what it's worth, testers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Jr4p66vSmLY">Qualified Scientist</a> say the Pixel Watch 3 is highly reliable for sleep accuracy. But Dr. Schneider still says that "there's some general event horizon where you're never going to get on the wrist a measure of what's going on in the brain."</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8" name="google-pixel-watch-3-sleep-tracking-2.jpg" alt="Sleep Tracking tile in Morning Brief on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g3VgNpcJfceduLa8MnGJx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Dr. Schneider about the recent trend of smartwatches and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> starting to detect sleep apnea and if there are other potential sleep conditions (aka <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.yalemedicine.org/conditions/parasomnias">parasomnias</a>) that he believes smartwatches could detect.</p><p>He very enthusiastically responded that "it could be a great opportunity for tech like this to actually pick up on" conditions like Restless Leg Syndrome and sleepwalking that can be difficult to catch in limited clinical contexts but that a smartwatch <em>will</em> detect with enough patience.</p><p>Smartwatches will need to be able to differentiate between REM behavior disorders (e.g., sleep paralysis), non-REM parasomnias ranging from sleepwalking to sleep talking and even sleep eating disorders, and seizure disorders.</p><p>Dr. Schneider seems very optimistic that watches could "pick up on interesting signals" in the future, "depending upon what set of sensors you have."</p><p>This would have a direct clinical application, too. After someone is treated for a sleep disorder, it's hard to determine if you're "truly" cured or just have "fewer episodes that you're <em>aware</em> of." A smartwatch could passively solve that mystery and give patients (and doctors) peace of mind.</p>

<p>I have a complicated relationship with sleep tracking. I wrote last year about how I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">hated wearing a smartwatch to bed</a>, and I've found that seeing bad sleep data can often compound my stress. So I asked Dr. Schneider why people can't trust their own bodies to feel how tired they are.</p><p>He responded with an anecdote about a man who said he was sleeping great while not believing his wife, who said he was "dying" at night and falling asleep at the wheel.</p><p>"People are terrible estimators. And why is that? Our brain habituates to our current state of being," he explained. You can function with a "severe amount of sleep impairment that you're not even fully cognizant of," and sometimes you need help recognizing that.</p><p>He believes it's worth the discomfort of a smartwatch to have this self-knowledge. And since he has to "convince people to wear a Darth Vader mask every single night" for sleep apnea, he thinks it's worth getting accustomed to <em>some</em> form factor of wearable tech to help you "figure out how you're feeling."</p><p>But if, like me, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> isn't the right fit for you, then Dr. Schneider thinks you really should consider that Nest Hub radar. To which I'd say, if Google hurries up and makes a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-should-build-new-nest-hub-with-gemini">3rd-gen Nest Hub with Gemini</a>, I'll consider it!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The fifth One UI 7 beta just landed in the U.S., pushing the Galaxy S24 Ultra one step closer to its stable Android 15 release in April.</li><li>This update smooths out issues like glitchy lock screen notifications, a wonky Nowbar controller, and those tiny, hard-to-see widget icons.</li><li>Samsung patched up the Gallery edit button for better reliability and made media playback notifications display in real time.</li></ul>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> in the U.S. just received its fifth One UI 7 beta update, rolling out a few days after Samsung made it official. This update brings the phone one step closer to the stable Android 15 release, which is set to drop in April.</p><p>This update brings a fresh camera feature to the table while squashing a bunch of bugs.</p>
<h2 id="bug-fixes-and-ui-tweaks-2">Bug fixes and UI tweaks</h2>
<p>Highlights include fixing a glitch with lock screen notifications, smoothing out display hiccups with the Nowbar controller, and tackling those annoyingly tiny icons in the widget settings.</p><p>On top of that, it cleans up blurry transparency effects, sorts out wonky font and image overlaps, and tightens up the spacing in the quick action menu.</p><p>Furthermore, the Gallery’s edit button should now work more consistently, and notification history errors have been patched up.</p><p>Samsung has also tweaked media playback notifications, making them show up in real time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:283.69%;"><img id="wSPvyBsDVTmhD4558pid4Y" name="One-UI-7-beta-5" alt="One UI 7 beta 5 changelog for Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wSPvyBsDVTmhD4558pid4Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest beta isn’t leaving the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus out of the fun—it’s bringing Log video support to these models too. That’s a feature that was exclusive to the S24 Ultra in Beta 4, so now more users can get in on the action.</p><p>Log Video, which first debuted with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series, lets you shoot videos with a wider dynamic range. This means you’ve got more flexibility to tweak colors and fine-tune your footage during editing.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-be-releasing-one-ui-7-on-april-7">locked in April 7 for the stable One UI 7 rollout</a>. However, U.S. users will have to wait a bit longer because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> will start hitting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy devices</a> in the country on April 10, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-7-announces-official-rollout-starting-from-april-7-2025/" target="_blank">Samsung US</a>.</p>

Just like the A-series phones that came before it, the Google Pixel 9a is available in four shades.</p><p>As is typical of the affordable Pixel lineup, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> comes in two basic colorways and two more colorful ones. Google never skips black and some sort of white or beige, so it's usually the other two shades that leave room for excitement. Let's take a look at all the colors of the Pixel 9a to help you choose one to buy.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-sets-trend-for-pink-phones">Pink is a hot trend</a> in the smartphone market right now, so the blushing Google Pixel 9a in Peony is a good choice if you care about being fashionable. It's a really fun color with matching accessories in the Google ecosystem, such as the Rose Quartz Active Band for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> in Peony.</p><p>If you're not a fan of pink, Iris is a fabulous choice, too. This powdery blue-ish hue has hints of purple in there. It's a pleasing shade, for sure. I wish it was more lavender than periwinkle, but I still adore this Pixel 9a-exclusive colorway. Based on past trends, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> bands will probably have the same color as well.</p><p>Don't sweat too much over the selection process. Buying the right color Google Pixel 9a is important, but you can always change the look of your device with a nice phone case. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">Cheap Android phones</a> like these have affordably priced covers, so it's not a big deal if you change your mind later or get tired of the hue.</p>

It gets the Tensor G4 — same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> — alongside a new 48MP camera and 13MP wide-angle lens, and a huge 5100mAh battery.</p><p>Google usually makes its devices available for pre-order on launch day, but that isn't the case with the Pixel 9a; instead, the device will be going on sale sometime in April. In a statement to Android Central, Google noted a "component quality issue" affecting initial Pixel 9a units as the reason: "We're checking on a component quality issue that's affecting a small number of Pixel 9a devices."<br><br>This is absolutely the right move; Google's devices have been disproportionately affected by issues in the past, so it makes sense that the brand is being cautious this time. Google didn't go into any detail as to what component is at fault, only stating that the device will be available from next month.</p>

<p>Google is clearly being ambitious with the Pixel 9a. While its predecessors retained the same design as their siblings, the Pixel 9a switches up the styling, and the flatter look along with a new camera island that sits flush with the body differentiates it considerably from the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro. <br><br>Just like the regular Pixels, AI is a key area of focus with the Pixel 9a, with Google bringing most of its on-device features to the mid-range device. There's a new thermal solution that should make it a better gaming phone — overheating was a big problem on last year's Pixel 8a. Google is also guaranteeing seven years of Android OS and security updates, which means the 9a will get more software updates than any other phone in this segment. <br><br>Debuting at $499, the Pixel 9a has the potential to be a terrific mid-ranger, and while I don't like waiting, it's better to do so in this instance — it ensures we get a device that doesn't have hardware issues out of the box. It's a refreshing change of pace from Google, and I'm doubly excited to see what the Pixel 9a has to offer.</p>

<ul><li>The “Untrusted device” error early this month primarily affected older Chromecast and Chromecast Audio users and caused a significant inconvenience.</li><li>Google now has provided specific firmware versions (1.56.467165 for 2nd gen Chromecast and 1.56.467166 for Chromecast Audio) and instructions for users to update their devices.</li><li>For users who’d factory reset their devices, the search giant advises updating the Google Home app and setting up the affected devices again to resolve the issue.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early this month, several older Chromecast owners reported issues with their devices as they were seeing “Untrusted device” errors. The issue was particularly faced by 2nd-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio users. While the search giant has already addressed the issue, it is now finally rolling out a fix.</p><p>Earlier this week, the Google Nest Team, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Streaming/Regarding-an-issue-with-Chromecast-2nd-gen-and-Chromecast-Audio/td-p/686992">corresponding support page</a>, apologized for the inconvenience and disruption caused and further notes that they are “committed to ensuring all users are back up and running as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>For users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-chromecast-second-gen-users-face-untrusted-device-error">who’ve faced the issue</a> and their devices still don't function as intended, the Google Nest team advises them to check the firmware version of the device — firmware version <strong>1.56.467165</strong> for 2nd gen Chromecast and firmware version <strong>1.56.467166</strong> for the Chromecast Audio — and follow with an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccheck-the-firmware-version-of-your-streaming-device">instruction page</a>.</p><p>Further, if their device doesn’t match the corresponding firmware version, users need to reboot their devices and start the update process, which seemingly should make the broken devices function normally.</p>

<p>When Google addressed the issue last week, it recommended users not factory reset their Chromecast devices. However, for those who have already done that, here's what you need to do.</p><p>Users are asked to update their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> app to the latest version (3.30.1.6 for Android and 3.30.106 for iOS) and set up the 2nd gen Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices again. The said app update roll out appears to have begun already, and users might be seeing the version in a couple of days.</p><p>We recommend users stay updated with the latest firmware and app versions to ensure they have a flawless streaming experience.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has finally announced the budget phone to its Pixel 9 series— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a arrives</a> with all the latest AI tools you'd need to get through your day-to-day activities. Google seems to have dropped us a Pixel-sized surprise right before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> and we aren't complaining. However, there are some significant changes that the device came with this year so let's get into it.</p><p>Right off the bat, you see the Pixel 9a sports an all-new look, ditching its usual "Pixel-like" appearance, for a sleek, flat, rear panel that houses the camera array within the phone. While the big pill-shaped camera bump seems to be all but gone, the phone has the same rounded aluminum side rails as its predecessors.</p><p>For its display, the Pixel 9a gets a slightly bigger 6.3-inch  pOLED screen but has a 35% brighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a </a>at 2700 nits — and a 120 Hz adaptive refresh rate, that brings smoother navigation within the device. Google says the Pixel 9a, much like the 8a has an <em>Actua</em> display, meaning Google worked hard to ensure proper color accuracy, but that also means it uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. The screen gets its protection from Gorilla Glass 3, Full 24-bit depth just like its previous model.</p>

<p>Getting to what lies at the heart of this budget model is Google's Tensor G4 (4nm) chipset much like this year's flagship models, that is said to power Gemini Nano and all the other AI features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8"><em> Best Take</em></a><em>,</em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9"><em> Add Me</em></a><em>, </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8"><em>Magic Editor</em></a><em> and more.</em></p><p>Talking about power, the Pixel 9a arrives with a massive 5,100mAh, which is larger than the standard Pixel 9 model(4700mAh), giving it a boost in battery life. Google claims that the device will have over 30 hours of battery life with just one charge and can run for up to 100 hours on Extreme battery saver mode.</p><p>With the massive battery also comes faster charging speeds since you wouldn't want to wait around for your phone to charge. The Pixel 9a trumps its predecessor with a 23W wired charging speed and supports 7.5W<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-google-pixel-9-support-qi2-wireless-charging"> Qi-certified wireless </a>chargers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Getting to the phone's camera system is now embedded into the back panel of the device, unlike any other Pixel phone to date. The device comes with a smaller 48MP primary lens, sticks to the 13MP ultra-wide lens from the Pixel 8a, and a 13MP selfie camera. All three lenses can capture 4K video, with 60fps for the rear cameras and 30fps for selfies.</p><p>Protecting all of these features is the IP68 dust and water resistance meaning the device can withstand submersion in water beyond 1 meter for more than 30 minutes, like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best-selling Android phones</a> on the market. It is important to note that this resistance can wear over time, based on usage and other factors.</p>

<p>Lastly, coming to the software that powers it all. The phone is said to come with the latest Android 15 out-of-the-box. This will also help power all of Gemini's latest features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, and Pixel-specific features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pixel-call-assist"><em>Call Assist</em></a><em>, Hold For Me, Direct My Call,</em> and more. That said, the budget Pixel 9a is on par with the rest of the Pixel 9 series, getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS updates </a>up until Android 22 along with security updates through to 2032. The device comes with enhanced security features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-second-pixel-feature-drop-brings-car-crash-detection-motion-sense-improvements-and-more"> Car Crash Detection</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-security-reinforcements-global-rollout"> theft protection</a> as well.</p><p>The Pixel 9a series starts at the same price point, $499, and comes in four colorways.  Adding to the existing Obsidian and Porceline are two fun colorways— Peony and Iris. The device comes with two storage options like its predecessor:  128GB and 256GB storage along with 8GB of RAM.

What made Google choose this new water-drop camera cutout, and is it the new normal for Pixels? Google gave us several justifications for the change and a hint of what to expect from the Pixel 10.</p><p>As our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> shows, this new budget phone has ditched the camera bar and rounded edges for a flatter, machine-cut look. The dual rear cameras jut out from the plastic matte back in a teardrop shape inspired by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> display aesthetic instead of resting inside an aluminum bar.</p><p>When asked during our Google Pixel 9a briefing whether Google made this decision out of logistics or aesthetics, Pixel product manager Soniya Jobanputra answered, "We did not start with the presumption that it had to be flat."</p><p>Instead, the Pixel team's priority was to "eliminate battery anxiety" and "improve our thermal solution." And while they didn't say it outright, their secondary concerns seemed to be keeping the Pixel 9a skinny <em>and</em> more distinct from the mainline <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p>

<p>One of the biggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 8a-to-9a upgrades</a> is a battery capacity boost from 4,492 mAh to 5,100 mAh, larger even than the 6.8-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>'s capacity. This helps it hit a "30+ hour battery life."</p><p>Asked about this battery life boost, product manager Shenaz Zach Mistry explained that "this user segment has also been very sensitive to the battery life," suggesting that budget Pixel buyers prioritized longer battery life over other factors.</p><p>"We had grown the battery, we had grown the vapor chamber to improve the thermals," Jobanputra said, and on top of that, "we were looking at a new camera module that had better capabilities" than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> camera.</p><p>Despite that, Google managed to keep the Pixel 9a and 8a at the same thickness (8.9mm). To do that, they had to look at solutions like shrinking the camera sensor and switching to a pOLED display that was "a lot thinner" than what they typically use in "this tier of product."</p>

<p>"The confluence of all that got us pretty darn close," said Jobanputra. "And so our mechanical team did a little bit of magic, working directly with our industrial design team to pull off this just absolutely fabulous looking new design with that flat back."</p><p>No one said it flat out, but after adding the thicker battery, the Pixel 9a engineers must have thought that the typical camera bar, rounded back, and OLED would've made the Pixel 9a too thick and ugly. So, rather than abandon the battery upgrade to make the 9a more distinct and exciting, they pivoted and treated a new, flat design as a positive challenge.</p><p>Jobanputra says it was a "culmination of a bunch of different factors" that got the Pixel 9a "within shooting distance" of a flat design. "And then once we were close, we were like, 'Let's do it. Let's make this happen. Let's give it its own personality, yet still be part of that Pixel family.'"</p>

<p>Earlier this month, we saw the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">Pixel 10 Pro leaked renders</a>. Whether they're real or not, it's all but guaranteed that Google seemingly has no intention of ditching its signature camera bar on <em>all</em> future Pixels, just the Pixel A-series, removing the overlap between it and the flagships.</p><p>The point of this "new flat design profile" was "setting [the Pixel 9a] apart from our other Pixel 9 phones," Jobanputra said while still "remaining true to the iconic Pixel look."</p><p>Making the Pixel 9a more distinct and turning the camera bar into a perk for mainline phone buyers is a solid branding decision if nothing else. Pixel fans will either adjust to the new look or upsell themselves to the Pixel 10 for the familiarity.</p><p>That said, I'm genuinely curious if the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel foldable</a> will adopt this new camera look simply to make it easier to fold into your pocket.</p>

<p>Judging the Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 8a is about more than the specs. Yes, Google significantly upgraded the display, main camera, and battery life. You must also weigh its drastic no-camera-bar redesign and whether the Pixel 9a is too similar to the 8a in other ways. If you bought the Pixel 8a to save money, is it too soon to drop another $500 on the 9a?</p><p>We loved the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and while our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a hands-on</a> only scratches the surface, we know what AI and camera features it'll have (or won't have) from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, as well as a general sense of what kind of performance boost to expect from the Tensor G4 over the G3.</p><p>Let's dive into the Google Pixel 9a vs. 8a differences and similarities to help you decide whether it's time for an upgrade or if you should hold out for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> or 10a.</p>

<p>The biggest Pixel 9a change stems from Google's decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">remove the camera bar</a> and give the newer model a flat back and "streamlined camera design." Google said that it was "inspired by water droplets" when making the new camera cutout, similar to what you see on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>, while the Pixel 8a has a more traditional Pixel look.</p><p>Both phones have the same official 8.9mm thickness, but the 8a has slightly softer edges — though you still feel the line between the aluminum sides and matte polycarbonate back. With the Pixel 9a, you get the harder, machine-cut edges that you typically see on iPhones or recent Galaxy phones, but the composite matte back is essentially unchanged. You need a mainline Pixel for a proper glass back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="aDMpcsg7XvS68icXuKTNGB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-side-view-2" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left) and Bay Google Pixel 8a (right) aside one another on a white table, the angle showing their relative difference in thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aDMpcsg7XvS68icXuKTNGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, if you're using a phone case, the type of grip won't really matter. Generally speaking, the Pixel 9a is only 0.6mm wider than the 8a and weighs a few grams <em>less</em>, probably because of the lack of an aluminum camera bar.</p><p>Both phones come in Obsidian (black) and Porcelain (near-white). The Pixel 8a came in a subtle Bay blue and vibrant Aloe green; the Pixel 9a, similarly, has a quieter Iris purple shade and a much more vivid Peony red-pink.</p><p>Like last year, the Pixel 9a has 100% plastic-free packaging and 100%-recycled aluminum. It uses 81% recycled plastic in the back cover, slightly more than the Pixel 8a (76%), but the 8a had slightly more "recycled materials based on product weight" (24% vs. 23%) because of its camera bar.</p>

<p>While the Pixel 8a had a respectable IP67 dust and water resistance rating, the Pixel 9a hits the IP68 standard common on most flagships. That means the Pixel 8a does fine for "temporary immersion" in shallow water for about 30 minutes, while the Pixel 9a might last longer at slightly greater depths — Google doesn't specify except to say that the 9a isn't "water or dustproof."</p><p>Google didn't upgrade the display protection rating: either phone gives you Gorilla Glass 3, well below the protective rating of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro'</a>s Victus 2. You may want to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">screen protector</a>.</p><p>You also won't notice any changes in terms of the optical fingerprint sensor, power button, and volume rocker, USB-C 3.2 port, stereo speakers, or dual mics.</p>

<p>One of the biggest Pixel 9a vs. 8a changes is the larger, brighter display. Fans of smaller phones may not like that the 9a jumps from a 6.1- to 6.3-inch display, while others will appreciate the extra space for apps and games.</p><p>The Pixel 9a uses a pOLED in place of the 8a's traditional OLED, swapping a glass substrate for a thinner plastic material, which helps the 9a stay the same thickness despite its larger battery. Otherwise, the 9a and 8a have the same 120Hz refresh rate — though no Pro-level LTPO tech — and 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, half as good as the mainline Pixel 9 and 9 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 8a display is slightly more pixel-dense, but not significantly so (430 vs. 422 PPI). More importantly, the Pixel 9a has an extra 400 nits of brightness in HDR mode and 700 nits in peak brightness mode, giving you better indoor and outdoor visibility.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-side-view" alt="A parallel photo of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, showcasing its thick, machine-cut design, the camera cutout, and the Google logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3918" height="2205" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a has the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip found in last year's Pixel 9 series, one generation past the Pixel 8a's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a>. Both phones have the same RAM and storage options, so any performance improvement will come down to the chipset.</p><p>Both Tensor chips are Samsung-made on a 4nm node. The newer Tensor jumps from an Arm Cortex-X3 (2.9GHz) to a Cortex-X4 (3.1GHz) prime core. The other cores are also one generation newer with slightly higher clock speeds: 2.6 vs. 2.37GHz for performance and 1.92 vs. 1.70GHz for efficiency cores. However, the G3 actually has one more performance core, so that might narrow the gap a bit. Our Pixel 9a review should give us more concrete information on benchmarks.</p><p>In terms of the GPU, both phones should have the same Arm Mali-G715 with six cores, except that the 9a GPU should be clocked slightly higher (940MHz vs. 890MHz). That said, we found that the Pixel 9 series tended to throttle performance while gaming to prevent overheating, so the lower-RAM Pixel 9a may have the same tendency. In other words, we wouldn't expect any significant gaming gains this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DFvmyLe3r3brPBjM84KHjh" name="google-pixel-8a-lockscreen-customized.jpg" alt="A customized Google Pixel 8a lock screen with a large, cartoony clock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFvmyLe3r3brPBjM84KHjh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The biggest performance change is in battery life. We've yet to test this for ourselves, but Google says the Pixel 9a will last an extra six hours (30 vs. 24) per charge or 28 hours (100 vs. 72) in Extreme Battery Saver mode. This is largely thanks to the extra 608mAh of battery capacity or a 13.5% increase over the Pixel 8a battery.</p><p>You may also see a slight boost in charging speed: Google says the Pixel 9a supports up to 23W wired charging, beating the 18W max on the Pixel 8a. It's still a bit short of the 27W charging on the pricier Pixel 9 phones, but slow charging was one of our main 8a complaints, so every little bit helps.</p><p>Wireless charging remains at the same 7.5W speed as last year, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 support</a> just yet and well short of the Pixel 9 (15W) or Pixel 9 Pro XL (23W) when using the Pixel Stand.</p><p>As for other hardware concerns, the Pixel 9a remains at Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, with no <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> like the Pixel 9 or Ultra Wideband like the 9 Pro. But the 9a does add dual-band GNSS for the first time, which will help pinpoint your Google Maps location or track workouts more easily in places with signal blockage, like tall buildings.</p>

<p>Google didn't change the ultrawide or selfie cameras between the Pixel 8a and 9a, so the main difference is with the main camera and the new AI-backed post-processing tools.</p><p>You may assume the Pixel 8a's 64MP sensor is better than the Pixel 9a's 48MP sensor at first glance, but the latter has a larger aperture for better light, a slightly wider FoV, and a Dual Pixel system with improved autofocus for action shots. The 9a's camera specs seem identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>'s main sensor, although Google says they're "slightly different," without specifying how.</p><p>On the other hand, the Pixel 8a has a larger image sensor (1/1.73" vs. 1/2"), which typically results in better light capture as well. The 9a prioritized a thinner design, so that may play into the quality of the photos. We'll have a more definitive answer after we can test the 9a for ourselves.</p><p>Otherwise, the newer Tensor G4 chip unlocks a few useful camera tricks that the Pixel 8a lacks. Google says the Pixel 9a is the first A-series phone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, and it also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> for group photos.</p><p>The Pixel 8a already has a long list of AI-backed tools — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-editor-on-the-pixel-8">Magic Editor</a>, Magic Eraser, Photo Unblur, Real Tone, Frequent Faces, and so on — and it matches the Pixel 9a with its 8X Super Zoom. Neither lets you access Pro camera controls like manual shutter speed, either.</p>

So, while it's impressive that the $500 Pixel 9a will get seven OS updates and seven years of monthly Pixel Drops, the Pixel 8a did it first.</p><p>The Pixel 9a will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and both phones are expected to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> at the same time this summer. Aside from those few Pixel 9 series exclusives like Add Me and Macro Focus, the 9a and 8a will have the same software until 2032.</p><p>Unlike the Pixel 9, the Pixel 9a won't come with a free year of Gemini Advanced. But you'll still get the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> features that you're used to on the 8a or other Pixels. You might see a <em>very</em> slight boost in AI performance thanks to Tensor G4, but nothing significant.</p><p>In other words, upgrading to the Pixel 9a from the 8a won't feel especially different from a software perspective.

<p>There's no doubt that the Pixel 9a is a superior phone to the 8a in both distinct and subtle ways. But anyone who buys the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phone</a> of 2024 (the Pixel 8a) might not want to spend another $500 so soon unless you're particularly impressed with one of the Pixel 9a preorder deals with a trade-in.</p><p>The switch to Tensor G4 is a nice perk, but unless you're especially excited by astrophotography or macro focus, the Pixel 8a's Tensor G3 is quite similar. The same goes for the display: it's larger and brighter, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-8a-vs-pixel-7a">8a-to-7a boost</a> was more significant.</p><p>Truly, the one change that has us most excited is the extra six hours of battery life or an extra day in low-power mode; if you're an active user and the 8a tends to die on you before the end of the day, the Pixel 9a should solve that problem.</p><p>If you don't own either phone, we'd recommend choosing the Pixel 9a over the 8a, even if the latter is on sale. But if you already own the Pixel 8a, it's more of a toss-up if you should upgrade.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-62">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Wallet is rolling out tap-to-pay for kids on Android, letting them make in-store purchases with their phones.</li><li>The feature is launching in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland over the next few weeks.</li><li>Kids need approval from their parents to add a card, and parents can track spending or remove the card anytime.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Children can now install the Google Wallet app on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and start using tap-to-pay to make purchases in stores.</p><p>After first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-for-kids-support-2025">revealing the feature back in October</a>, Google now says it's rolling it out in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland in the next few weeks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>’s tap-to-pay system, similar to Apple's solution, lets users store payment information on their phones or smartwatches for easy use. Previously, kids under 13 couldn’t set up payment profiles, but that rule is changing, opening up the feature to younger users.</p><p>Kids can now use Google Wallet’s tap-to-pay feature to make contactless payments, unlocking it with a fingerprint, face scan, PIN, or passcode. The app lets them store things like gift cards and event tickets.</p>

<h2 id="parental-controls-keep-things-in-check-2">Parental controls keep things in check</h2>
<p>To help parents manage their kids’ spending, there are a few built-in limits. First, kids can’t add a card to their wallet without a parent’s approval. Once a card is added, parents can monitor transactions and remove the card if needed. Plus, the cards can only be used for tap-to-pay in stores, meaning no online shopping is allowed.</p><p>The feature initially launched on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>. After it got a thumbs-up from users of the kid-friendly smartwatch, Google decided to bring it to Android devices managed through Family Link.</p><p>Google's move puts it in closer competition with Apple, which has long let kids use Apple Pay in stores through Apple Cash Family. But there's a big difference—Apple also allows online shopping and peer-to-peer payments, while Google Wallet sticks to in-store tap-to-pay only.</p><p>Anyway, Giving parents more control over their kids’ spending is a clear win for everyone.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 7a was a banger of a budget phone, and it continued to be our go-to recommendation even during the initial phase of the Pixel 8a launch. What makes it even better in 2025 is Google's recent decision to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">extend software support</a> for it by two years, which means the 7a now stands to get updates till 2028. If you currently own it, it's only natural to make a Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a comparison.</p><p>The Pixel 8a was a big step up from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a> is even better. If you're currently on the lookout for a new budget phone, should you compromise on performance and save big on the Pixel 7a, or spend a bit more and get the latest Pixel 9a? For existing owners of the 7a, should you upgrade now or wait it out for a few more years? Let's take a look.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-design-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-iris-in-hand" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a held in hand, the photo taken downards to emphasize its color and size." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HqrWLy2Ro9cTHCgLrY4HcA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a and 7a have very similar dimensions but look quite different. The 9a loses the camera bar on the back but retains a similar pill-shaped cutout for the lenses, like the 7a, but it now sits flush with the rest of the rear panel. The corners are also not as rounded, so it may be less comfortable in your palm when you hold it. Both phones have roughly the same thickness of about 9mm, but the 9a is lighter.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in Obsidian and Porcelain, but also Peony (pink) and Iris (purple). The Pixel 7a launched in Charcoal, Sea, Snow, and Coral, but not all colors are easily available today.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6tn6yCppmaQ8gYUQSrS3gH" name="Google-Pixel-7a-dirty-01.jpg" alt="Dust and fingerprints on the Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6tn6yCppmaQ8gYUQSrS3gH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones feature a polycarbonate back panel and an aluminum frame. The 7a's glossy back panel is notorious for picking up fingerprints and smudges, which is not the case with the matte finish on the 9a.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with flagship phones. The Pixel 7a's IP67 rating is still respectable for its class, just that it can't handle prolonged submersion as well as the 9a.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-display-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand. The display shows the lock screen, with the time and unlocked symbol visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a has improved display specs over the 7a. For starters, it's a larger 6.3-inch panel with Google's Actua display tech. It has a Full HD+ resolution, 60-120Hz variable refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. In comparison, the 7a has a 6.1-inch OLED with the same resolution, up to 90Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. What's funny is that both phones share the same Gorilla Glass 3 protection, which is not great for 9a in 2025.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also has a pOLED screen, which contributes to the lower overall weight of the phone. Both phones have an optical in-display fingerprint sensor. We found the Pixel 7a's display to be more than adequate for everyday use when we tested it, and we're sure the Pixel 9a should fare even better. When it comes to using both phones under direct sunlight, the 9a's screen should be a lot more legible.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-hardware-and-battery-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Kdn7pHjPhJBkcTujnXXvP3" name="Google-pixel-7a-gaming-polytopia.jpg" alt="Playing the game Polytopia on a Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kdn7pHjPhJBkcTujnXXvP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a comes in at the same price as when the 7a launched (and the 8a, for that matter). It's $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You get 8GB of RAM across both variants. This is one area where the 7a loses out as it only comes in a single 128GB of storage. This is quite less, even by 2023 standards, as actual usable storage is lower. On the plus side, you can find it online for as low as $330, making it incredible value.</p><p>In terms of performance, the Pixel 9a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC as the Pixel 9, along with the Titan M2 security chip. You should expect the same level of performance in apps, games, and AI capabilities as the rest of the 9 series. The Pixel 7a runs a much older Tensor G2 SoC, which was a flagship chip for its time.</p><p>Still, Google's SoCs aren't exactly known for their performance, which means both phones should do fine with light workloads, casual games, and AI features. The Pixel 9a should perform better in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games" target="_blank">premium Android games</a>, though, and shouldn't heat up as much as the G2 did.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9zzBNRuBw3bxP48ug2pvoL" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-03.jpg" alt="The back of the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zzBNRuBw3bxP48ug2pvoL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Battery life is one of the highlights of the Pixel 9a as it has a considerably larger 5,100mAh capacity over the 4,385mAh battery in the Pixel 7a. Google claims you can get "30+ hours" of battery life from the 9a, which is impressive. If you're frugal with your usage, you can knock out more than a full day with the 7a on one charge. Google claims it can do "Over 24 hours," and this is without using the power saver mode. There's no substitute for a larger capacity, though, and here, the 9a should easily have the 7a beat.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also supports faster charging speeds, but only just. Wired charging is now 23W from 18W on the 7a, while wireless charging with a Qi charger is 7.5W vs. 5W. The Pixel 9a doesn't really revolutionize charging speeds in any way, and with the larger capacity, the zero to 100% sprint between the two might actually be close.</p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-close-up" alt="A close-up of the new camera module on the Google Pixel 9a." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BZ8A3X23iMhCNKXGcVNDwA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The main cameras on the Pixel 9a and 7a are quite different, but the others are similar. The 9a has a 48MP main sensor with a wider f/1.7 aperture, but the actual sensor size is a bit smaller than the 7a (1/2" vs. 1/1.73"). The 7a does have a narrower f/1.89 aperture, though, which means photos could end up looking similar from both phones.</p><p>The Pixel 9a supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, which is a first for an A series phone, according to Google. Other Pixel 9 camera exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> are also supported on the 9a. The 7a won't be getting any of the new AI camera features due to the older SoC. Thankfully, when it comes to the actual quality of photos and videos, it's still one of the best. The 9a should be able to do slightly better with the new ISP in the G4 chip, but that's something we'll have to test when we review it.</p><p>Both the Pixel 9a and 7a have a 13MP ultrawide camera and a 13MP selfie camera. Both have a fixed focus with only slight variations in the field of view. The 9a and 7a are capable of 8x Super Res Zoom and can shoot up to 4K video at 60fps.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-software-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="XdMmfD6PbabJsVJAb632CL" name="Google-Pixel-7a-back-06.jpg" alt="The back of the Charcoal Google Pixel 7a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XdMmfD6PbabJsVJAb632CL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software experience of the Pixel 9a and 7a should be very similar. The 9a comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out the gate but the 7a can just as easily be upgraded to the latest version. The 7a was originally supposed to get just three OS upgrades, but Google added two more years of support in December 2024, breathing new life into the phone.</p><p>While the usage experience should be similar, some of the AI features and apps like Pixel Studio, Reimagine, and Add Me are exclusive to the 9 series, which includes the Pixel 9a. The Pixel 7a won't be getting any of these features due to hardware limitations.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-7a-which-should-you-pick-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 7a: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-on-grass" alt="The Porcelain Google Pixel 9a laying back-up on a mossy surface next to a plant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XFSdkoSwZq3cScHznhJeYB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a is clearly the better phone of the two and is the one I'd recommend getting. It offers updated hardware, a bigger battery, better waterproofing, and a host of useful AI features. Gaming performance should also be much better, with little to no heating issues. The icing on the cake here is that it still costs $500, and this is before you factor in any trade-in discounts or offers.</p><p>The Pixel 7a is still a good phone and will be relevant for a few more years thanks to Google's extended support for it. If you only wish to spend around $300, you won't find a better phone than the 7a at that price. If you currently own a 7a and it's doing what you need it to do, I'd say hold off from upgrading to the 9a and wait till next year or when Google stops supporting it. If it's just the weak battery life that's driving you to upgrade, maybe get yourself a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">good USB-C power bank</a> to push through another year of usage.</p>

<p>This is a personal take, but I don't like the flat look of the Pixel 9a one bit. It's emulating the S24 series, which I have previously said lacks personality. Google took away the fun aspect of its Pixel devices from the 9a. Looks aside, though, the lack of a camera unit also makes the phone more susceptible to damage as the bar would break the fall. This is where the best Google Pixel 9a cases come in.</p><p>Features like raised edges or lips around the camera unit, screen bezels, buttons, and ports are paramount to preventing serious damage from falls. The Spigen Nano Pop MagFit has you covered on that front. This Pixel 9a case is robust, lightweight, and ergonomic, and it supports all of Spigen's magnetic MagFit accessories, so you can add wallets and grips willy-nilly.</p><p>Buying a phone like the Pixel 9a and not being able to admire its colorful coat of paint is a shame, especially when considering the bright Peony and Iris shades. Get something transparent like the Poetic Guardian MagPro Case if you'd like to protect your phone but also be able to showcase its looks. Poetic's magnetic case is a bit more expensive than Spigen, but it also covers the front of the phone, so you don't need to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">screen protector for your Pixel 9a</a> separately.</p>

<h2 id="invest-in-a-solid-google-pixel-9a-screen-protector-2">Invest in a solid Google Pixel 9a screen protector</h2>
<p>Much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-cases">best Pixel 9a phone cases</a>, screen protectors are essential accessories for all phones. If I had to choose one, I'd say that a screen protector is more important than a case. Scratches and scrapes on the body of your phone usually only diminish resale or trade-in value, but it's not the same thing for displays.</p><p>You may end up needing a replacement screen following some nasty abrasions that render the touch input useless. This is why you need to invest in a durable Pixel 9a screen protector, be it glass or plastic.</p><p>Don't worry about straining your budget because all the best Pixel 9a screen protectors are priced below $10 for the most part. Opt for popular brands with good reputations, such as Milomdoi. Milomdoi's three-pack is the most comprehensive tempered glass screen protector kit for your Pixel 9a, complete with multiple camera lens protectors and spares. Plus, it even comes with an installation frame to help you align the glass perfectly with your Pixel 9a's 6.3-inch OLED display.</p><p>Spigen is another trusted phone accessory maker with decades of experience in the industry. The brand has a name for making high-quality phone cases and screen protectors. If you're seeking a premium-grade experience, the Spigen GlasTR EZ Fit Tempered Glass Screen Protector for the Google Pixel 9a is a good choice.</p>

It's the first hard-edged, no-camera-bar Pixel I've ever seen, with the 2019 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> as the closest Google-made lookalike I could find. And it takes some getting used to.</p><p>We've seen more and more Android phones take the flat-edged, machine-cut route in recent years, from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. The Pixel 9a sharing that style is no surprise, but it comes in tandem with a flattened camera sensor that makes the whole package look very minimalist.</p><p>Google explained <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">why it cut the camera bar</a> during its pre-brief: it prioritized adding a larger battery, which meant finding ways to thin down the design to keep it from becoming too bulky. And the designers wanted to "give it its own personality" yet still have it "be part of that Pixel family."</p><p>As someone whose first Google phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6">Pixel 6</a> and who currently uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>, I have no small amount of nostalgia for the camera bar as it's evolved from a massive rectangle to a bold oval cutout. Despite Google's reasonable justification, seeing the camera equivalent of the Pixel Watch's droplet display smooshed into the Pixel 9a's top-left corner was an adjustment!</p><p>Since Google has asked us to hold off on any 9a software coverage or testing until next week, I can only focus on surface-level impressions and officially shared specs for this Pixel 9a hands-on. But there's already plenty of information for us to chew on, particularly how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-8a">Pixel 9a was upgraded over the Pixel 8a</a>.</p>

<p>I obviously couldn't test battery life in a short demo, but the new 5,100mAh battery and larger vapor chamber make themselves known across the entire Pixel 9a design. You could argue it's the signature upgrade!</p><p>Google managed to keep the 9a at the same 8.9mm thickness as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, but only through plenty of "optimization." Google said they had to "shrink" the camera module down to a thin sliver and use a skinnier pOLED display — the same type you see on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>.</p>

<p>Despite all that effort, the Pixel 9a is about 0.5-1mm thicker than most of our favorite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>. Why? Because these phones typically have much larger displays and dimensions, so they have more space to spread out their 5,000mAh batteries.</p><p>That said, it's <em>very</em> rare to see a battery this large paired with a display this petite. Weigh its 5,100mAh capacity against the 3,500mAh iPhone 16, 4,000mAh <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, 4,492mAh Pixel 8a, or 4,700mAh Pixel 9; it puts that extra thickness in perspective.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="qUux9arns5iV3Jw4cCXdeB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-vs-8a-vs-7a" alt="The Iris Google Pixel 9a (left), Bay Google Pixel 8a (center), and Obsidian Google Pixel 7a (right) on a desk, the photo showcasing their different designs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUux9arns5iV3Jw4cCXdeB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Compared to past A-series phones, the 6.3-inch Pixel 9a is a couple of grams lighter than the 6.1-inch Pixel 7a and 8a. For anyone used to this lineup, the 9a might <em>look</em> thicker because you don't get those rounded sides anymore, but it's more of the same.</p><p>If you're bold enough to go caseless, you'll appreciate that Google preserved the 8a's rounded corners. As I held the 9a, I appreciated the softer sides in my palm compared to the harder points of the 7a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tEvPRepyrPs4QyTneAFuQa" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-in-hand-close-up-16x9" alt="Porcelain Pixel 9a in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tEvPRepyrPs4QyTneAFuQa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In hand, it doesn't feel especially dense, and the smaller width compared to your typical 6.8-inch handheld makes it more comfortable in general.</p><p>One obvious quality of life improvement, thanks to the missing camera bar? Sliding the Pixel 9a into your pocket is easier than it's been for any Pixel since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-5a-review">Pixel 5a</a>. No more snags and fumbling! (Don't worry, I didn't try and smuggle out a 9a in my pocket.)</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If the new Pixel 9a camera cutout looks familiar, Google says that's on purpose. Pixel product manager Soniya Jobanputra explained that they were "inspired by water droplets, similar to the design showcase on our Pixel Watch faces."</p><p>Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, I can see the resemblance, but they're more like cousins than siblings. The Pixel Watch is large enough to make the droplet comparison obvious, while the 9a lens is a bit too thin for the droplet theme to be as apparent.</p><p>One similarity between them is that both make me anxious when it comes to drops or falls. This exposed camera sensor sticks out a sliver, enough to take the brunt of a fall; I'd definitely recommend using a Pixel 9a case.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="TcmmVrDFsS8Csxq2JVwAfB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-close-up" alt="A close-up of the Obsidian Google Pixel 9a, the photos focused on the camera cutout and LED." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TcmmVrDFsS8Csxq2JVwAfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One thing I quickly noticed with the camera sensors in person is that they tend to catch dust and gunk along the edge. This also applies to any Pixel camera bar or naked S25 camera sensor, and it's less noticeable on the Porcelain, Peony, or Iris models than on the Obsidian. But it's still worth noting.</p><p>I can't judge the camera quality yet, but Google gave the Pixel 9a a new 48MP main sensor that Google says is "slightly different" from the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> but has the same core specs; check that review for a preview of the quality to expect.</p>

<p>The 9a sensor beats the 8a's with a larger aperture and Dual Pixel autofocus, but does have a smaller resolution and image sensor.</p><p>I'd assume the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> will provide a little more postprocessing oomph — along with new exclusives like Macro Focus and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>. Generally speaking, the Pixel A-series has a reputation for great budget photos thanks to Tensor, regardless of the sensor quality.</p><p>This shrunken-down sensor is at the core of the Pixel 9a's "new flat design profile." Jobanputra says they wanted to "set it apart from the other Pixel 9 phones while still remaining true to the iconic Pixel look."</p><p>From that, I took that this hard-edged, soft-cornered look might be the norm moving forward, while the camera bar will become a flagship perk. However, if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">leaked Pixel 10 renders</a> are to be believed, they suggest the next-gen will keep the camera bar.</p>
<h2 id="pixel-9a-specs-the-hardware-you-d-expect-mostly-2">Pixel 9a specs: The hardware you'd expect (mostly)</h2>

<p>While I have to save my hardware and software opinions on the Pixel 9a until my review, Google's production team shared some insights into its production that should help you know what to expect.</p><p>As mentioned above, the Pixel 9a has the "biggest battery life of any Pixel available today," bigger even than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Google says they wanted to "eliminate battery anxiety" and that "this user segment has also been very sensitive to the battery life," prompting them to make it a priority.</p><p>As much as we loved the Pixel 8a, battery life was arguably a weak point compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">other budget phones</a>. Now, the Pixel 9a capacity beats the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, and while it may be too expensive for the true "budget" crowd, it could still gather more attention than before.</p>

<p>In the past, teardowns have shown that the A-series uses a slightly different version of Tensor chips than the flagships. One journalist asked during the briefing if this would be the case for the 9a, and they responded that it is "the same chip that is in the 9 and the 9 Pro."</p><p>Whatever's going on with the hardware, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 benchmarks</a> fall short of Snapdragon-powered phones, and the Pixel 9a will have 4GB less RAM than the Pixel 9. That said, I think it'll be easier to stomach mid-tier performance with a mid-tier price.</p><p>Google also slightly upgraded the Pixel 9a charging speed to 23W, but that's still slower than the 27W speed that our Pixel 9 reviewer called "almost unbearably slow." And I personally wouldn't bother with 7.5W wireless charging.</p><p>As for other upgrades to highlight, the Pixel 9a slightly improves its water resistance to IP68, and the display hits the same brightness as the Pixel 9. But otherwise, you're getting the same memory, storage, connectivity standards, ports, refresh rate, and ultrawide/ selfie cameras as the Pixel 8a.</p><p>In other words, the Pixel 9a might <em>look</em> like a paradigm shift for the series, but the guts haven't changed except in predictable (and useful) ways. Even the price is unchanged: it'll cost you $499 when it launches this April.</p>

<p>The Pixel A series has steadily been offering better value with each generation, thus blurring the line between it and the mainline Pixel phones more so than ever. Last year's Pixel 8a was a great example of this, and this continues as we compare the new Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9.</p><p>We weren't too thrilled that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> received a $100 price bump over the Pixel 8, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel 9a</a> coming in at the same price as the 8a poses an even bigger threat to the 9. For just a handful of features that remain exclusive to the 9, does it even make sense to buy it anymore now that the 9a is in town? Let's compare the main aspects of the two phones, starting with design.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-design-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Design</h2>

<p>Google is finally giving its A series phone its own identity by removing the rear camera bar. The Pixel 9a's rear camera module is just an island cutout surrounded by a flat polycarbonate surface. The design is said to be "inspired by water droplets," which is nothing new, to be honest. The camera bar has been a Pixel's identity for years, so this will take some getting used to.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in the standard colors of Obsidian and Porcelain, but also Peony (pink) like the 9 and a more subtle Iris (purple) shade. The 9a is a tad thicker than the 9 due to the larger battery, but it is quite a bit lighter at just 185.9 grams. The rest of the dimensions are nearly the same, so it should be as comfortable to hold and use as the Pixel 9.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with the Pixel 9. Google says the aluminum used in the housing is 100% recycled and that the packaging is 100% free of plastics.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 has a weightier body at 198g, probably due to the glass back panel. It too features recycled aluminum in the construction. The 9 has a more imposing look as well compared to the 9a, thanks to the prominent island camera bar on the back.</p><p>The flat sides and rear panel are also very comfortable to hold. In our review, we noted that there's a slight curve where the frame meets the front and rear glass so it doesn't dig into your pinky finger when using it with one hand.</p><p>The Pixel 9 also comes in four colors; Peony, Wintergreen, Porcelain, and Obsidian. It too has an IP68 rating and a USB 3.2 Type-C port</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="CQMLXkYkiTBxB7v3NtevHB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-display-lock-screen" alt="The Google Pixel 9a held in the photographer's hand.

<p>The Pixel 9a and the Pixel 9 have nearly identical display specs, save for a few things. Both feature a 6.3-inch Actua display with a Full HD+ resolution, 60-120Hz variable refresh rate, and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness.</p><p>To keep costs down, though, Google has used an older Gorilla Glass 3 protective glass for the 9a, compared to Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the 9. The 9a also has an inferior contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 vs. greater than 2,000,000:1 on the 9, on paper anyway. Finally, the 9a uses a pOLED panel compared to a regular OLED panel in the 9.</p><p>I would have liked to see Google step up the shatter protection for the glass on the 9a, as the 8a also had the same one. Given how similar the display specs of both the phones are, I imagine the usage experience should also be the same, which is to say, very good. Either way, you'll definitely want a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9a-screen-protectors">screen protector for the Pixel 9a</a>.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-hardware-and-battery-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-side-view" alt="A parallel photo of the Peony Google Pixel 9a, showcasing its thick, machine-cut design, the camera cutout, and the Google logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2f7mpfHXguDNwaFGso2TNB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3918" height="2205" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google isn't increasing the price of the Pixel 9a, which means it starts at $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You still get 8GB RAM across variants, just like before. It would have been nice to see 12GB, but it might be asking for too much at this price.</p><p>The Pixel 9a also uses the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC as the Pixel 9, along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-google-titan-m2-and-tensor-security-core-work">Titan M2</a> security chip. This means you should expect the same level of performance in apps, games, and AI capabilities. The Tensor G4 is nowhere close to Qualcomm's flagship chips when it comes to raw performance, but it is more power-efficient than the G3 and can handle sustained workloads longer before it begins throttling.</p><p>Battery life is going to be the Pixel 9a's highlight as it has a considerably larger 5,100mAh capacity over the 4,700mAh battery in the Pixel 9. Google is touting "30+ hours" of battery life for the 9a, which is impressive. Fast charging is present, but it's not as quick as the Pixel 9. The 9a can do up to 23W wired when using Google's 45W adapter. Wireless charging is capped at 7.5W with Qi-certified EPP chargers, but there don't seem to be faster speeds if you use the Pixel Stand.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 is priced at $799 and $899 for 128GB and 256GB of storage, respectively. However, since it's been a few months since the phone is on sale, you can find it a little less online. The Pixel 9 has 12GB of RAM across both storage tiers. The phone also uses the Tensor G4 SoC, which is capable as long as you don't do anything too intensive on it.</p><p>Despite the smaller capacity, we're quite happy with the battery life of the Pixel 9, as it is able to last a full day on one charge in our daily use. Enabling Energy Saver can extend this even more, albeit at the cost of some performance. There's 27W wired charging here and 15W wireless charging (with Pixel Stand), but both are not exactly impressive numbers for an $800 phone.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-cameras-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B" name="Google-Pixel-9a-porcelain-camera-bar" alt="A close-up of the top of the Porcelain Google Pixel 9a, focused on the camera cutout with buttons and the Google logo visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/So6NSXYppG28gHfCyEYX4B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera sensors on the Pixel 9a are quite different from the Pixel 9. The 9a has a 48MP main camera, 13MP ultrawide, and a 13MP selfie camera. The main camera is optically stabilized and supports 8x Super Res Zoom, but the sensor itself is smaller than the 50MP sensor in the Pixel 9. The aperture is nearly the same (f/1.7 vs. f/1.68), but overall, the Pixel 9 should be able to capture clearer low-light photos and video with less noise. We'll know for sure once we've tested the 9a.</p><p>The ultrawide camera in the Pixel 9a lacks autofocus and also has an inferior aperture, sensor size, and field of view to the Pixel 9. However, the 9a still supports features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-macro-focus-on-pixel-7-pro">Macro Focus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">Astrophotography</a>, which is the first A series phone to do so, according to Google. Other Pixel 9 camera exclusives like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> are also supported.</p><p>Finally, the Pixel 9a has a slightly higher resolution selfie camera compared to the 10.5MP sensor on the Pixel 9. The 9a's camera even has a marginally wider field of view, but it lacks autofocus, so the depth of field behind your subject(s) might not be as shallow as what the 9 can deliver.</p><p>Video recording capabilities are similar on the Pixel 9a and Pixel 9, with 4K 60fps being the max. One thing worth noting is that the 9a can only do 4K 30fps with the front and not 60fps. Digital zoom is also better (7x) on the 9, compared to the 9a (5x).</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a will receive seven years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates, which means you should be sorted until early 2032. The Pixel 9 also gets seven years, but because it launched in August 2024, its update cycle should end in 2031. That's still a long time, whichever way you slice it, and going by Google's Android release schedule, both phones may have the same Android version by the time support ends.</p><p>The Pixel 9a ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, which means you can start exploring all the great new features right away. Both phones will get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> together later this year anyway, making them equal. The Pixel 9a should have all the great AI features that debuted with the Pixel 9 since they both share the same SoC.</p><p>There's not going to be any noticeable difference in the usage experience, either. The Pixel 9 could be slightly smoother to use due to more RAM, especially when using some of the AI features. We'll know for sure and report back in our Pixel 9a review.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9-which-should-you-pick-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're looking at it purely from a value proposition, the Pixel 9a easily beats the Pixel 9 and is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. Its biggest draw over the Pixel 9 would be the (mostly) superior battery life, lower price, lighter weight, and the same performance and AI features. This makes it a strong contender to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phone</a> in 2025.</p><p>The only thing you're losing out on would be faster charging speeds and stronger camera specs, which are not massive deal-breakers in my book. The Pixel 9's "quicker" charging isn't exactly something worth bragging about, and Google's camera post-processing algorithms are on another level altogether, so the 9a might not have to deal with <em>that</em> big of a quality loss anyway.</p><p>In my opinion, it only makes sense to get the Pixel 9 if you come across a good deal where it's under $600 or you hate the new design of the 9a. If you're going to be spending over $800, then you might as well get the Pixel 9 Pro.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-pixel-updates-mean-for-users-2">What do the Pixel updates mean for users?</h2>
<p>Google gave the latest Pixel 9a the same number of updates as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a" target="_blank">Pixel 8a</a> and the rest of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>. With those updates, you get all the goodies that come with a Pixel phone, such as updates to features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android" target="_blank">Gemini</a> and fun ones like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-audio-magic-eraser" target="_blank">Magic Eraser</a>, Zoom Enhance, Audio Magic Eraser, Top Shot, Face Unblur, Circle to Search, and more.</p><p>The Google Pixel 9a launches with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, so you can expect the latest features and updates up to Android 22. You can also count on getting all the security updates your Pixel needs to stay safe from online threats. Your Pixel includes anti-malware, anti-phishing protection, and spam protection in the Google Phone and Messages apps. With seven years of updates, there is a good chance you'll be thinking about getting a new Pixel before support ends.</p><p>With everything the new Google Pixel 9a offers, it's no shocker that it will be among the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones" target="_blank">cheap Android phones</a>. It's also great to see the latest Pixel with the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> processor as the flagship models. Keeping the seven years of updates is great, but what makes this Pixel even better is having a more prominent 6.3-inch display than the 6.1-inch on the Pixel 8a. So, if you like bigger displays, you'll be happy with this change.</p><p>Google also gave the Pixel 9a a 5,100mAh battery, which should last all day and then some. That's good, as it means you'll be charging the phone less, which can help with longevity. But if you want to give your Google Pixel 9a additional protection against drops, remember to pick up one of the best Pixel 9a cases to keep it protected for the entirety of its lifespan.</p>

The Pixel 9a isn't "waterproof," per se, but it is water resistant with an IP68 rating. That means it can withstand submersion in water up to 1.5 meters deep for 30 minutes. However, it does have limitations.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="can-the-google-pixel-9a-go-for-a-swim-2">Can the Google Pixel 9a go for a swim?</h2>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a shares the same IP68 rating as the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> series. IP, or Ingress Protection, certifies that the phone meets international dust, debris, and water resistance standards. Unsurprisingly, it has this rating since Pixel phones are among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android phones</a>.</p><p>Reading the rating is simple: The first number indicates the level of protection against solid objects, with six meaning complete dust resistance. The second number, eight, signifies water resistance up to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes.</p><p>While this rating provides solid protection, it has its limits. You should never take your Google Pixel 9a diving, scuba diving, or into any high-pressure water environments, as the phone's rating does not protect it from those activities. However, the phone can survive an accidental drop in the tub or toilet, and it'll be fine if you get caught in a rainstorm. If you need to take your Pixel to the beach, keeping it in a waterproof bag to keep sand and salt water from getting in is best.</p><p>Even though the phone can resist those situations, you should turn it off, dry it with a microfiber cloth, and place it on a flat surface to air dry. These actions help extend your Pixel's lifespan. Ensure the pins are dry, as corrosion can damage them and cause charging problems.</p><p>While the Pixel 9a phone has an IP68 rating, wear and tear can weaken that rating over time. So, if possible, you should avoid getting your phone wet. Google offers Pixel users some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7533279" target="_blank">great advice</a> on how to keep their phones in tip-top shape. For example, they should be cautious about letting young children use their phones or not taking them into the shower, sauna, or bathtub.</p><p>Google also advises using a Bluetooth speaker to listen to music from a distance to avoid accidents. Also, try to avoid dropping your phone since, despite the screen having Corning Gorilla Glass 3, water could get in and damage the hardware.</p><p>With everything this beauty offers, why wouldn't you want to take extra care of it? The Google Pixel 9a comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, seven years of OS/security updates, and a 6.3-inch Actua display with a 1080 x 2424 resolution.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-the-new-google-pixel-9a-charged-up-2">Keeping the new Google Pixel 9a charged up</h2>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Google Pixel 9a</a> is an exciting new affordable device in the line that offers enticing premium features despite its lower price tag. When it comes to power, the phone, which has a 6.3-inch Actua display, is equipped with a 5,100mAh battery, the biggest battery in a Pixel phone to date. With this, you’ll get 30 or more hours of battery life per charge: that’s more than a day! You can even extend this to up to 100 hours or an impressive four days using the Extreme Battery Saver mode.</p><p>Along with support with Qi wireless charging at a rate of 7.5W with a compatible Qi charger, the Google Pixel 9a also supports fast wired charging, so you can be back up and running in no time when you’re in the red. For the fastest wired charging, which is up to 23W, you’ll need Google’s 45W USB-C charger plugged directly into a wall adapter. That adapter is sold separately.</p><p>Nonetheless, this is great news for those who want to leverage all the fantastic power-hungry features of the phone, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Google Tensor G4</a> chip, 8GB RAM, up to 2,700 nits peak brightness, HDR support, great rear, wide, ultra-wide, and front cameras, AI tools, including photo and video editing tools, a great mobile gaming experience, and more.</p><p>Google is not alone in failing to include Qi2 wireless charging in the Pixel 9a: there are few phones that truly support this new charging standard to date. With all of its other fantastic features, however, the Google Pixel 9a is likely to usurp its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a>, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best overall cheap Android phone</a> on the market.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-qi2-wireless-charging-2">What is Qi2 wireless charging?</h2>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-wireless-charging-standard">Qi2 wireless charging</a> is the latest charging protocol set by the Wireless Power Consortium (WPC), announced late in 2023. The open wireless charging standard is based on Apple’s MagSafe technology and consists of a ring of magnets that make it easier to align your device on a wireless charging surface. The result in faster charging speeds of up to 15 watts as well as more efficient charging, overall.</p><p>Note that Qi2 wireless chargers are backward compatible with Qi, so you would still be able to recharge the Google Pixel 9a on a Qi2 wireless charger or charging surface. It just wouldn’t charge at the fastest speed, continuing to charge at a rate of 7.5W.</p><p>Currently, there are only a handful of smartphones that support Qi2 charging, including the latest iPhones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series phones are technically “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>,” able to charge wirelessly up to 15W. But they don’t have magnets inside, so you’d still need a compatible case to mount them properly. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> also supports magnetic charging via a case but does not support the Qi2 standard.</p>

<p>Samsung's FE series has been an excellent choice for anyone who wanted a flagship phone, without the flagship pricing. The latest one is the Galaxy S24 FE, which has all the right upgrades we were hoping for but at the wrong price. Now that it has been a few months since it launched, you can find the base model for close to or under $500, which is what it should have cost in the first place. This also makes it a direct competitor to the new Pixel 9a, which also starts at $500.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a> offers most of the features of the more expensive Pixel 9 at a lower price. It's the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a> and the Galaxy S24, but here, the FE offers more value by offering better specs. Confused about the Google Pixel 9a vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE? Let's clear those doubts, shall we?</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-all-four-colors-on-desk-3" alt="All four Google Pixel 9a phones in each color (Iris, Peony, Porcelain, and Obsidian) placed artistically against or in front of a wooden display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJXtYDWoTq5WCEsME2AsXB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is larger than the Pixel 9a due to the much larger screen, but it is slimmer at just 8mm. Not much could be done about the weight, though, which is 213 grams, so you will feel the heft in your pocket. The Pixel 9a has a more compact size and is quite a bit lighter at 186 grams.</p><p>The Pixel 9a comes in Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony (pink), and Iris (purple). The Galaxy S24 FE also has pastel shades of Mint, Blue, Gray, and Graphite.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE has a more premium build thanks to Gorilla Glass Victus Plus on the back and front, while the 9a has Gorilla Glass 3 on the front and polycarbonate on the back. The Pixel 9a also has a very distinctive look, which gives it some freshness. The FE looks like any other Samsung A or S series phone, which is to say, a bit boring.</p><p>The Pixel 9a finally gets upgraded to an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, putting it on par with other flagship phones. The Galaxy S24 FE matches this, too, so both have an equal chance of survival when dunked in water.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE home screen in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a and Galaxy S24 FE have bright and sharp displays, but Samsung's offering is better for viewing media and gaming due to the larger size. The 6.7-inch AMOLED panel has a Full HD+ resolution, a pixel count of well over 300ppi, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of up to 1,900 nits. Having Gorilla Victus Plus glass on the FE is a nice bonus for top-end scratch protection.</p><p>The Pixel 9a has a 6.3-inch pOLED screen with a similar resolution, adaptable 120Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness rating of 2,700 nits. The display's scratch protection is pretty out of date, though, with just Gorilla Glass 3. Neither of these phones has LTPO panels, which can vary the refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz to save battery.</p><p>The cost-cutting continues with the fingerprint sensors in both models. The Pixel 9a and Galaxy S24 FE use optical fingerprint sensors and not ultrasonic ones.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-search.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Google search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a is priced at $499 for 128GB and $559 for 256GB. You get 8GB of RAM across both variants. Samsung's official pricing for the Galaxy S24 FE is still $649.99 and $709.99 for 128GB and 256GB variants if you buy it from Samsung.com. On Amazon, though, certain colors of the S24 FE dip below $500 for the base model, and this phone gets good discounts during sales.</p><p>In terms of raw performance, there's no contest, as the Galaxy S24 FE should easily beat the Pixel 9a with its more potent Exynos 2400e SoC. It's essentially the same flagship 2400 chip found in the Galaxy S24 series but with a slightly lower CPU clock speed. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip in the Pixel 9a isn't known for its brute strength, but it's more efficient in gaming and AI tasks than before. Samsung is the way to go if you're a gamer or need strong processing power in your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="iqQmsFnXPX4jGBwouVwAGB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-obsidian-in-hand" alt="The Obsidian Google Pixel 9a held in hand, backlit by a monitor with the words "Google Pixel" flashing behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iqQmsFnXPX4jGBwouVwAGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a comes back swinging with a much larger battery capacity of 5,100mAh compared to the 4,700mAh in the Galaxy S24 FE. The fact that Google has managed to squeeze this in and keep the weight down is amazing. We've not tested the 9a yet, but we're confident it should last longer than the S24 FE with similar workloads.</p><p>Charging speeds are not particularly impressive on either phone. The Pixel 9a can do 23W with Google's 45W charging brick, while Samsung can do 25W. The Galaxy does support quicker wireless charging at 15W with the right charger, versus 7.5W on the 9a.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE has a much better rear camera setup with a third telephoto camera, something the 9a lacks. There's a 50MP main camera with optical stabilization, a 12MP ultrawide with autofocus for macro shots, and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The latter will probably deliver good results only under good lighting, as it is a small sensor.</p><p>The Pixel 9a lacks a telephoto, but we know Google's Super Res Zoom can deliver pretty amazing results even with digital zoom. The 9a has a 48MP main camera and a 13MP ultrawide. The Pixel also supports many AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and Reimagine, to name a few. The S24 FE also gets some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features from the S24 series like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-instant-slow-mo-on-a-samsung-phone">Instant Slow-Mo</a>. The Galaxy can also shoot in 8K resolution, something that the Pixel  9a can't do.</p>

<p>Both phones offer a suite of AI features and equally long software support of seven years, so your choice would ultimately depend on what features you would actually use. The Pixel 9a comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15,</a> so you're already on the latest version the moment you take it out of the box. Another advantage is that the 9a will always be among the first phones to get the latest flavor of Android and security patches, so you'll be up to date before others.</p><p>Samsung has been pretty prompt in issuing updates of late, and we can expect the same for the Galaxy S24 FE. There are plenty of Galaxy AI features to explore here, too, like Photo Assist, Circle To Search, Sketch To Image, Live Translate, and Interpreter. One UI also offers a good amount of customization to the interface, and it's one of the better-looking skins out there.</p><p>That said, we are waiting for the Galaxy S24 FE to receive the One UI 7 update, which should begin rolling out in April.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-which-should-you-pick-2">Google Pixel 9a vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Which should you pick?</h2>

<p>If you're not restricted by a budget, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is the one I'd pick for the better performance, telephoto camera, and more premium build. If you can find the base model for nearly $500, it's even better. Samsung is offering the same length of software support as Google for the FE, which is another feather in its cap.</p><p>The Pixel 9a is a great option if you want a more compact phone without compromising on camera quality. It's likely to become one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> without any sales, and it should be able to deliver better battery life than the FE. It's not the best phone for gaming, and you might need a screen protector as the glass isn't as resilient as the FE.</p><p>Software will also play a big role in your decision. The 9a should always get the latest Android version before the Galaxy, and many prefer the clean, uncluttered interface of Pixels.</p>

<h2 id="google-pixel-9a-charging-speed-battery-and-more-2">Google Pixel 9a charging speed, battery, and more</h2>
<p>Following an incessant barrage of leaks over the past couple of months, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> is finally here. As the latest and the most affordable member of the Pixel 9 family, the phone brings a number of improvements and upgrades over its predecessor.</p><p>But while all that's great, among the most noteworthy upgrades is the inclusion of a 5,100mAh battery, which is a whole lot better than the 4,492mAh battery of the previous-gen model. Google claims a battery life of up to 30 hours (according to internal testing), but the real question is, how fast can you charge it once it runs out of juice?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB" name="Google-Pixel-9a-peony-in-hand" alt="A close up of the Peony Google Pixel 9a held in hand in front of a houseplant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BciJF9MfTRJVKdER5zttUB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9a supports up to 23W wired charging, which is certainly better than the 18W speed of the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>. However, considering that a two-year-old budget phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a> comes with 50W wired charging, we can't help but feel Google should've done better.</p><p>Oh, and that's not all! If you need the Pixel 9a to charge at 23W, you need to pair it with Google's 45W USB-C wall charger. And as expected, you'd have to buy that separately. Apart from that, the phone also supports 7.5W wireless charging. Sure, it's super slow, but at least it's there.</p><p>Even with its somewhat uninspiring charging speeds, we have no doubt the Pixel 9a is going to end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> available out there. It comes with class-leading cameras, a fresh design, feature-laden software having all sorts of AI-powered goodness, and, of course, seven years of major OS and security updates. It's a well-rounded smartphone that ticks almost all the right boxes, as long as you don't mind waiting a while for it to juice up.</p>

<ul><li>The Oura Ring 4 is debuting on Costco's website, expanding its coverage for consumers looking to strive for better health goals.</li><li>The company says the ring is available today (Mar. 19) for Costco Members in sizes four through 15 and in gold, silver, and black.</li><li>Oura's smart rings were previously only sold through its channels, but it brought the series to Amazon in 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Oura announces a major next step in expanding the reach and availability of its latest smart ring.</p><p>Today (Mar 19), Oura announced its partnership with Costco. The company hopes its product can assist Costco's broad and diverse group of consumers with access to "premium health technology." Beginning today, the post states Costco members can purchase the Oura Ring 4 directly from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.costco.com/">retailer's website</a>. Consumers will find the Ring 4 available in sizes four through 15.</p><p>More importantly, the smart ring can be purchased in three colors: gold, silver, and black.</p><p>Considering the Oura Ring 4 to rolling in for Costco Members only, the wearable will be featured in a "Oura Ring 4 bundle." The post states this bundle will provide consumers with an additional charger to ensure your smart ring can keep up with your daily life.</p><p>Oura is once again expanding its coverage with its smart ring, looking to make its technology "accessible to individuals at every stage of life." The company says its new partnership with Costco "simplifies" the path to proactive wellness to assist consumers in reaching their health goals. Furthering this partnership with Costco is Oura's CMO Doug Sweeny who states, "Costco members are known for their commitment to quality and their trust in the brand's curated selection of premium products, which aligns perfectly with Oura's dedication to providing exceptional wellness solutions."</p><p>Moreover, Sweeny adds this partnership will "empower more individuals to take control of their health."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3895px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF" name="Oura-Ring-4-review-12.jpg" alt="The Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8o8EYvaRRYUABGwZ9ZxweF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3895" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's more, this major retail expansion will join Oura's other partnerships with Best Buy in the U.S. and the U.K., as well as Target and Amazon. Oura has also established "successful" partnerships with stores like John Lewis in the U.K. and Elkjop (Nordics).</p><p>As Oura highlights its recent wave of retail expansions for smart ring availability, it's worth touching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-retail-amazon-samsung-competition">on its Amazon debut in 2024</a>. The company's entire smart ring collection hit Amazon's digital shelves in March last year with Sweeny stating it was a "natural step for us." Previously, Oura only sold its smart rings through its website directly with shipping stemming from its warehouses.</p><p>Similar to sentiments stated today about its Costco expansion, Oura widening its ring net with Amazon opened it up to a "very, very wide demographic of people."</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> debuted last fall with a sleek and durable design alongside an improvement in sensor accuracy. The bundle being offered to Costco Members might be a worthwhile pair for the device's larger battery, which can last up to eight days on a single full charge. Comfortability was a key aspect of the Ring and its updated sensory accuracy means there are fewer "gaps" in your heart rate and blood oxygen readings.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is revamping ChromeOS on the digital assistant front, swapping out the familiar Google Assistant for the newer, smarter Gemini.</p><p>On Tuesday, March 18, Google officially announced the rollout of the stable ChromeOS M134 update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/gemini-google-assistant-chromebooks/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Now, when users try to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> on their Chromebooks, they'll be redirected to the Gemini app, according to the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/331983080/introducing-chrome-os-m134-to-the-stable-channel" target="_blank">community post</a>.</p><p>This move is part of Google’s bigger plan to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">replace Google Assistant with the AI-powered Gemini across all devices</a>, from phones and wearables to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/best-smart-home-devices">smart home devices</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:579px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:113.82%;"><img id="PeuVWNih2Er76i8pEVs35g" name="gemini-on-chromebooks" alt="app launcher on Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeuVWNih2Er76i8pEVs35g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="579" height="659" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The latest ChromeOS update kicks off Google’s step-by-step plan to replace Google Assistant with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> on Chromebooks. Once the switch is fully done, you’ll spot the Gemini icon in the top-right corner of the app launcher. For now, though, don’t expect to summon Gemini with a “Hey Google” since voice commands aren’t on the table just yet.</p>
<h2 id="web-like-gemini-experience-2">Web-like Gemini experience</h2>
<p>After updating to the latest ChromeOS build, tapping the Assistant feature will now take you straight to the Gemini Progressive Web App (PWA). It’ll feel just like using Gemini on the web, complete with handy perks like uploading files and deep research.</p><p>For clarity, Gemini was already accessible on ChromeOS, but this update makes it the default, fully replacing Google Assistant as the main digital assistant.</p><p>Furthermore, ChromeOS 134 also debuts “Slow Keys,” an accessibility feature that helps users with motor impairments or arthritis type more accurately. It adds a customizable delay before keystrokes register, which can be adjusted in the Accessibility settings.</p>

<p>ChromeOS 134 also spices things up with an upgrade to the Quick Insert feature. Now you can drop GIFs straight into chats or documents using the Quick Insert menu.</p><p>Google’s rolling out this update in phases, so don’t be surprised if you don’t see the Gemini interface pop up right after installing the latest software.</p>

My biggest annoyance with the Apple Watch is that it's unmistakably a tech product; it doesn't look or feel like an actual watch.</p>

<p>This is where hybrid smartwatches come into the equation. These products look like regular watches, but they come with the usual smarts that you'd associate with a smartwatch, including health and activity tracking, workout logging, and even blood oxygen and ECG monitoring. So when Withings asked if I wanted to take a look at the ScanWatch Nova, I was interested. <br><br>I knew Withings made hybrid smartwatches, but I didn't pay particular attention to its products, so I had no idea what to expect with the ScanWatch Nova. I liked the design and thought it was an intriguing product, but it's only after I started using it that I understood its true potential. <br><br>Now, before we get started, you'll need to know that the ScanWatch Nova is pricier than most smartwatches in the market, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a> and Huawei Watch Ultimate demand a higher price. The hybrid smartwatch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Withings-HWA10-model-7-WITHINGS-Scanwatch-Nova/dp/B0CP25YM8K">costs $599 on Amazon</a>, and that's twice what you'd pay for a standard Galaxy Watch 7.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5mbVSMtd6qWkrNxmgaoYje" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mbVSMtd6qWkrNxmgaoYje.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, Withings justifies the cost by delivering what is the best-looking hybrid smartwatch around. The ScanWatch Nova has a gorgeous design, and the dive-inspired dial immediately allows it to stand out. I'm a huge fan of Citizen's products — I own a half-dozen Promaster watches — and the Nova looks like the Promaster Dive. It even gets a Super-LumiNova coating that allows the indices and hands to glow in the dark.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k7etNEguEaTjdSohPrn2oe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nova has a 42mm watch face, and it has a stainless steel case with polished edges, a ceramic rotating bezel, steel rotating crown, and anti-reflective strengthened glass. The watch has a metal bracelet out of the box, but Withings includes a fluoroelastomer band in the package, along with the requisite tools to adjust the links on the metal band, which is a nice touch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vpnTQE9k9AvHDMQvwLcWoe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpnTQE9k9AvHDMQvwLcWoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the ScanWatch Nova is available in black, blue, and green dials, and I went with the green option as that looks particularly striking. The Nova still looks pristine after a month of use that included travel to three countries, and that's after my 21-month-old got a hold of the watch and decided to throw it about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7PG534xvfrXsUEHiSsadqe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7PG534xvfrXsUEHiSsadqe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design combined with the attention to detail makes the ScanWatch Nova one of the best-looking watches around, and the elegant design is a clear selling point. Coming in at 63g, the Nova isn't heavy that you'd notice, but it has the right amount of heft to feel like a regular watch — this is an issue with most smartwatches, which end up being too light.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xS3wKvdFNmdoennQpd54pe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xS3wKvdFNmdoennQpd54pe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At a quick glance, it isn't evident that the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, and the only indicator to its smarts is the 0.63-inch dial that houses an OLED panel. It is a monochrome panel with a pixel density of 282PPI, and text looks clear without any fringing. <br><br>Text is easily readable even under sunlight, and while the size of the panel means you're limited in what notifications show up on the watch, it wasn't a big problem as such. It's easy to navigate the menus via the rotating crown, and you can view heart rate info and activity data with relative ease.</p>

<p>Although the ScanWatch Nova is a hybrid smartwatch, it has a full suite of health monitoring sensors. You get an optical module to measure heart rate, an SpO2 sensor, a new TempTech24/7 sensor that measures skin temperature throughout the day, and an electrocardiogram module that lets you take ECG readings on the watch itself. <br><br>In this regard, the Nova is just as good as a regular smartwatch, and if anything, Withings has an edge thanks to ECG readings. The feature does a good job, and even with regular heart rate and blood oxygen monitoring, the Nova held its own against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a>. <br><br>There's also a cardio check-up that's bundled with the Withings+ subscription. I'm not a fan of subscriptions, and I don't quite see the point of Withings+; it has workouts and meal plans, and provides a scorecard based on your health and activity data, and while I used the trial, I didn't see enough value in paying $10 a month. Considering the cost of the Nova, Withings should have offered a free year of Withings+, but that isn't the case.</p>

<p>Coming to activity monitoring, the ScanWatch Nova does a good job logging steps, and it even has automatic activity detection. I tested it with my indoor bike, and while it took a little while to notice the activity, it logged it without any intervention. The data is in line with other smartwatches I tested, and while you don't get much metrics on the Nova itself, the mobile app does a great job highlighting activity data. <br><br>The only issue in this area is that the Nova doesn't include a built-in GPS, so if you're running outdoors, you'll need to bring your phone along. That is an annoyance, and other than this omission, there isn't anything missing on the smartwatch. I had no issues with notifications either, and while not as customizable as a regular smartwatch, it serves the need — and that's what I want.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage with a hybrid smartwatch is battery life, and the ScanWatch Nova excels in this area. I got close to three weeks of battery life before having to charge the smartwatch, and not having any battery anxiety is a genuine differentiator. The Nova uses a custom charging cradle, and it takes over two hours to charge, but you'll only be doing so once a month. <br><br>Ultimately, the ScanWatch Nova does everything I need in a smartwatch, but it doesn't look or feel like one, and the elegant design combined with extensive health and activity monitoring make it a great — if costly — choice. I used the watch for a month now, and in that time, I didn't feel the need to go back to the Apple Watch — which in itself is the highest praise I can give the Nova.</p>

Google highlights it as one way to enhance graphics, while the Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) can dynamically scale graphics in a game when your phone gets hot. It's a two-pronged attack that aims to solve real-world issues with mobile gaming.</p>

<p>My colleague Andrew Myrick talked about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-16-looks-to-be-even-better-for-gamers-than-we-expected">how Vulkan will help accelerate gaming</a> on dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handheld Android consoles</a>, but what about phones? Several Android games already utilize Vulkan to help accelerate performance and include advanced graphics features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-galaxy-s24-support-ray-tracing">like ray-tracing</a>. Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, Pokemon TCG Pocket, Summoners War: Chronicles, Diablo Immortal, and PUBG: New State all use Vulkan by default.</p><p>While Vulkan concentrates on providing advanced graphics options and enabling more efficient multicore performance, ADPF ensures that games run at a consistent rate no matter how long you play. If I've learned anything about high-end processors, it's that they tend to run very hot after 30-minute (or longer) gaming sessions.</p><p>Nothing makes a high-end phone feel more disappointing than when your favorite game still runs terribly on it after just 30 minutes of game time. That's where I think ADPF is going to come in clutch, as it'll help games scale graphics quality on-the-fly to match the thermal requirements of your phone, keeping the frame rate high all the time while ensuring the best graphics possible throughout.</p>

<p>Don't confuse Vulkan for the Star Trek race of the same pronunciation. Vulkan is a replacement for Open GL, a graphics library that's been around since 1992 but has been substantially upgraded since. While Open GL has been great for a long time, its existence is a little long in the tooth and it doesn't support many modern graphics features.</p><p>A glance at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/rendering-features-for-mobile-games-in-unreal-engine">latest Unreal Engine features table</a> will show you substantial differences in capability when using Vulkan versus Open GL ES, mostly related to lighting and texture quality on mobile devices. It also enables new technologies like ray-tracing which makes lighting and reflections substantially more realistic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:107.57%;"><img id="29d6Cv3aWskTMCJhY9Bxnj" name="diablo-immortal-ray-tracing-on-off" alt="A comparison of ray-tracing capabilities in Diablo Immortal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/29d6Cv3aWskTMCJhY9Bxnj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Activision Blizzard)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what about performance? Vulkan was built with multicore processors in mind while Open GL has historically done a poor job of utilizing all the lovely cores that are packed inside a processor like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p><p>So I put it to the test against several different classes of phones including flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, mid-range offerings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a>, and budget options like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, and older phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord N30 5G</a>. What I found was incredibly disappointing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vulkan isn't a silver bullet or a magic trick. It can offer better performance but often requires a lot of work to make that happen in existing games.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>For the test, I ran a few games and benchmarks that allow you to choose between Open GL ES and Vulkan. I also used the 3DMark Slingshot Extreme benchmark, specifically, as well as PUBG: New State and the Dolphin emulator. Each of these options all ran better in Open GL ES than on Vulkan. This seems like a paradox considering Vulkan is heralded as a paradigm-shifter in performance, but a lot of this depends highly on the game in question and the hardware it's running on.</p><p>The 3DMark test on the OnePlus Nord N30, which runs on a 2022 Snapdragon 695 chipset and Android 14, performed quite a bit worse using Vulkan than Open GL. Graphic test 1 ran 2FPS slower on average using Vulkan, while the physics test was 50% <em>slower</em> than using Open GL. I expected exactly the opposite.</p><p>OK, so how about newer hardware? The Nothing Phone 3a uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> which debuted two and a half years after the Snapdragon 695. The phone also runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, yet we see a similar pattern. The graphics test portion was a wash between the two APIs — 0.5 FPS faster on one test and 0.5 FPS slower on the second — while the physics test was nearly 100% slower running on Vulkan. Wow.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Building a game in Unity using the Vulkan backend exposes features that simply aren't available with Open GL, stressing the importance of Vulkan-only development going forward.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>PUBG: New State and the Dolphin emulator didn't seem to benefit from Vulkan, either. On the three lower-end phones, Open GL ran Dolphin a few FPS better than Vulkan. I didn't see any difference between the two APIs in PUBG: New State. I couldn't find anything that stressed the OnePlus 13 enough to find a difference between Vulkan and Open GL, either.</p><p>If you expected Vulkan to give old games an immediate performance boost on older hardware, you might want to adjust those expectations. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-improve-performance-valheim">I previously wrote about</a> how much Vulkan improved performance in games like Valheim, which saw an immediate 50% performance increase when using Vulkan on certain hardware. That gave me false hope, as it turns out things are a lot more complex than I imagined.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Dp2JFVCEAZoK6Ezjfmi5Zg" name="open-gl-vs-vulkan-pubg-new-state-oneplus-nord-n30" alt="Comparing performance between Open GL and Vulkan in PUBG New State on a OnePlus Nord N30" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dp2JFVCEAZoK6Ezjfmi5Zg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>,To get a better understanding of why this strange dichotomy occurs, I spoke to the developer of the highly-rated game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/grab/4104088956355944/">GRAB on the Meta Quest</a>, Slin, who told me Vulkan "can be a silver bullet, but only in some cases and only if done right." GRAB uses a custom Vulkan-based engine rather than big names like Unreal or Unity.</p><p>"It does, for example, have this subpass feature which allows to do some basic post-processing on mobile without the major performance hit" you'd usually get from Open GL.</p><p>Vulkan works very well on Quest and other Snapdragon-based mobile chipsets but some engines, like Unity, don't always offer an easy way to switch from Open GL and get the best performance. But building a game in Unity using the Vulkan backend exposes features that simply aren't available with Open GL, stressing the importance of Vulkan-only development going forward.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Android 16's Vulkan requirement ensures that new games have access to the best new graphics features.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Games like Valheim were likely putting more strain on the CPU using Open GL, while Vulkan freed up the process and let the GPU do more work. However, implementing Vulkan in an existing game is a lot of work. Translating the old language — Open GL — into the new Vulkan language is a skill some people will inherently be better at than others.</p><p>I hoped that enabling Vulkan would be like flipping a switch, but that's simply not the case. "My guess is that it’s a problem with Unity retrofitting it into their huge legacy codebase and having to make it work well for everyone with every feature," Slin told me.</p><p>Vulkan certainly can boost performance under the right circumstances but it's not likely that <em>old</em> games will see much difference even if it's natively implemented. Other people <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_mBi74eldQ">came to the same conclusion</a> when comparing the two, but Android's switch to Vulkan-only should help in the future.</p><p>What you should expect is that games like Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile were able to deliver better graphics in a <strong>new</strong> game using Vulkan. In other words, this change is forward-thinking rather than for backward compatibility, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is likely to deliver more of a difference than current versions of Android.</p>

<p>Adding ray-tracing to the ice reflections in Diablo Immortal is cool but <em>very few</em> people are going to be able to notice the nuance differences feature like ray-tracing add to a game on a 6-inch screen. Rather, mobile gamers want better and more <strong>consistent</strong> performance out of their mobile games.</p><p>A number of games with crazy good graphics — like Fortnite, Call of Duty, Diablo, etc — support automatic graphics scaling that aims to keep your frame rate as smooth as possible, but the calculation to get there isn't exactly <em>intelligent</em>. Games that support dynamic visual scaling features often base this scaling on sheer performance numbers. If the game was running at 60FPS when it started but is now dropping to sub-50 FPS, the game will change the resolution, texture quality, or other assets to raise the frame rate again.</p><p>While this isn't a bad idea, it doesn't take device thermals into account. Sure, reducing these values will reduce CPU and GPU load which will eventually lower the temperature of your device, but without knowing the actual temperature it's difficult for a game to understand why and when it needs to scale. That's where Android Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) comes in.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>ADPF ensures a consistent framerate across a wide portfolio of devices, ensuring more users see better gaming performance overall.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>ADPF was announced over a year ago but, as with many things, implementing it takes time. In a nutshell, ADPF allows the game and the system to talk to and understand each other in a way that wasn't possible before. Games can now understand how hot a phone gets and <em>why</em> it's getting so hot, helping to schedule upcoming graphics quality changes to keep the phone from getting hot in the first place.</p><p>The chart below shows the sustained performance difference after 30 minutes in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kakaogames.ares">Ares: Rise of Guardians</a> between running the game at the highest graphics settings and a second session where ADPF was enabled. Pay specific attention to the yellow line. The improvement couldn't be greater.</p><p>During the high-quality graphics test, the game's frame rate hovered just under 30FPS with slight drops to 25FPS. By 10 minutes in, the game was wildly fluctuating between 15FPS and 28FPS. By the roughly 23-minute mark, the game held steady at an unplayable 15FPS.</p><p>Meanwhile, with ADPF enabled, the game was able to maintain a consistent 25-30FPS throughout the <em>entire</em> 30-minute play session. In addition to that, the thermal profile graphs were managed much better, keeping the device under the thermal warning level for longer.</p>

<p>It's a brilliant way to implement device intelligence and share pertinent information that helps everything work better together. While ADPF still needs to be implemented for each game — again, this isn't a switch that Google can magically turn on or off — it represents a greater possibility to provide more consistent performance across a wider portfolio of devices than anything else we've seen before.</p><p>It's here where I think the vast majority of users will see the biggest improvement. Mid-range devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">Samsung Galaxy A-series</a> are often <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/global-smartphone-market-share-q1-2024">the best-sellers</a> in any given quarter, and it's these phones that'll likely see the biggest impact with dynamic graphics scaling. Being able to push the best graphics during the slow parts of a game could result in a big wow factor for new phones and games, ultimately driving people to play games on their phones even more than they already do.</p>

<ul><li>Google Play Store keeps sending multiple update notifications to Pixel and Samsung users.</li><li>These notifications seem to be coming from first-party Google apps needing an update, even though they've been updated to the latest version.</li><li>Dismissing these notifications doesn't seem to make them go away, as they keep recurring after a few minutes.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Recently, Google went on a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> mass deletion spree</a> and took down several apps on Play Store that were part of a massive Ad fraud that engulfed them. Today (Mar. 18), Android users are frustrated with some kind of bug that's taken over the Play Store —sending constant notifications asking them to update the app.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/18/update-google-play-services/">9to5Google</a>, these notifications were being sent by first-party apps like Google Messages, Google Search etc. Asking users to update the app, otherwise they won't function properly.</p><p>However, once users click on the notification they're taken to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gms&pli=1">Google Play Store's home page</a>, all in vain; since the apps don't show any update available to be installed. The latest updated version available as of now is  v25.09.33.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A phantom Google Play services update prompt in Google Messages as of this morning. pic.twitter.com/pxvrDy1Dnu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1902011447082918237">March 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>That's not all, the most frustrating thing that users say is that this notification never goes away. It keeps popping up every couple of minutes even after being dismissed, more like a loopy bug.</p><p>This bug seems to be impacting all Android devices users including Google Pixel and Samsung phone owners. One such Pixel user took to Reddit indicating that they had been dealing with this issue all morning and even tried to, reboot the phone as well and delete cache and storage for Google Play Services and Google Play Store, but that didn't do much either. The notification kept coming back with different Google apps showing up in the notifications tab.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMessages/comments/1je3twx/update_google_play_services/">user stated</a> "This is occurring on my S25 Ultra but not my Pixel 9 Pro XL. The Ultra is running version 25.09.62 while the Pixel is running version 25.10.33. Both are on non-beta firmware."</p><p>Some have even suggested checking for any updates by heading to <strong>Security & privacy > Updates. </strong>However, as of now, there seems to be no fix in sight. Android Central has reached out to Google about this ongoing bug and will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>It is important to note that any troubleshooting steps that users have mentioned on Reddit threads are simply suggestions and aren't official guidelines to fix the issue.</p>

<ul><li>In the latest Android 16 beta 3, the battery icon features a dynamic color scheme, changing to red when the battery is low and vibrant green when charging.</li><li>The traditional five-segment Wi-Fi signal indicator is also reduced to three segments offering a streamlined appearance.</li><li>These visual updates are found hidden in the latest beta and are not enabled by default and might change before the official release.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 16 is the next awaited operating system release from Google, and the search giant has already rolled out betas for its Pixel phones. New findings from the latest beta suggest that we could be seeing significant changes in UI elements starting with the battery icon.</p><p>According to Mishaal Rahman’s findings (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-new-battery-icon-3534047/">Android Authority</a>), Google seems to be working on new status bar icons with the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> operating system. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 beta 3</a> has shown Rahman some changes to the status bar icons, which indicate Wi-Fi signal strength and battery level.</p><p>The Wi-Fi icon, over the years, has showcased five segments indicating the signal strength, which is now being shifted to only three segments. It seems to be a nifty little change with the upcoming Android 16. Similarly, the battery icon has remained unchanged for quite some time now, which appears to be notably changing its colors this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hFh2eghhf5irp7E9qSVwGB" name="Android-16-revamped-battery-and-wifi-icon" alt="Android 16 revamped battery and Wi-Fi icon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFh2eghhf5irp7E9qSVwGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Rahman notes that the white background on the battery icon will now have a dynamic color scheme. Solid white remains in the background when the phone’s battery is fully or sufficiently charged. It will turn red when the battery is too low and not charging. However, the other significant change happens to be when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is charging because it now showcases a vibrant green color.</p><p>Furthermore, the battery icon is also flipped to a horizontal orientation as opposed to the previous iteration, which had a vertical orientation. Also, there is a new, bolder font for the battery level percentage indication. These new status bar icons aren’t enabled by default in the Android 16 beta 3 and are enabled manually, which could mean that it could still be in the testing phase and may or may not make it live when the official version rolls out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:918px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:65.36%;"><img id="DGbXxY8KeWYT2YFhoT98KV" name="android-16-live-updates-test-live-demo-chip-pop-up" alt="An example of Android 16's Live Updates chip and its pop-up notification about an order's completion." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DGbXxY8KeWYT2YFhoT98KV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="918" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It isn’t the first time that Google has tested the revamp of status bar icons, including the battery. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-major-design-changes-status-bar-icons">Last April</a>, Android 15’s developer preview also suggested a possible revamp happening to the status bar icons. However, the revamped battery icon didn’t make it to the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> release later.</p>

<hr>
<p>Rumors claim Samsung is encountering resistance with one of its Exynos SoCs, which could hinder its cheaper Flip.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202503131628018800108339&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00">The Bell</a> (Korean), Samsung is supposedly unsure if its next clamshell foldable will rock the Exynos 2500 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/latest-galaxy-z-flip-fe-rumor-exynos-2500-haters-love/">SamMobile</a>). More specifically, the report claims the chip was seen as the chip of choice for the "Galaxy Z Flip FE" that's been rumored for a while now.</p><p>Originally, the report states the chip was supposed to enter mass production in 2024, but that never happened. The publication's alleged industry source claims, "The situation changed abruptly in the second half of the year for various reasons." It adds that Samsung's LSI and Foundry Divisions encountered severe problems with the chip, which reportedly "ruined" it.</p><p>At the time moment, the "production plan" for the Exynos 2500 is still uncertain, according to its source. This has supposedly provoked Samsung into delaying the release of the Galaxy Z Flip FE "several months after" its expected launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-flip-might-have-a-surprise-processor">flagship Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>The post claims the Exynos 2500 was also looked at as a contender for the flagship Flip 7, but that might not happen. Instead, Samsung may have to lean on Qualcomm for its next clamshell.</p>

<p>We've heard rumors about an Exynos 2500 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2500-soc-specs-leak">since early last year</a>. Reports suggested Samsung was looking to kick its performance up a notch with a 10-core structure continuation. However, the upgrades could arrive via a single Cortex X-5 CPU with speeds that could vary between 3.2 and 3.3GHz. Rumors also stated the chip could feature three Cortex-A730 cores, clocking inn anywhere from 2.3 to 2.5GHz.</p><p>The chip is supposedly going to be built off Samsung's 3nm process alongside AMD's RDNA-based Xclipse 950 GPU. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025">analysts continue to speculate</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip FE's existence, stating it is on deck for 2025 — though this Exynos rumor might've pushed it back in the year.</p><p>The Bell's report states that while Samsung is allegedly struggling with its Exynos 2500, the company is still pushing ahead with the 2600 SoC. We heard something similar earlier this month with one report claiming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">Samsung is "urgent"</a> about producing the Exynos 2600. The Korean OEM is rumored to have created a task force to oversee its production and performance as it looks to not slip back any further behind the competition.</p><p>Another report eight days later claimed Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-next-gen-4nm-process-chip-production-reported">started mass producing</a> the chip. It'll be a while before we see the Exynos 2600 as it's suspected to debut in the Galaxy S26 series.</p>

Not an AI-enhanced or AI-infused motion capture of the actress, but a fully AI-generated clip said to be part of a prototype stage experiment by the studio.</p><p>The clip was quickly removed for copyright violation so I can't share it with you, but it showed the character conversing with the player using voice prompts and is in no way anything that's ready for use. The narrator makes this very clear and says it's simply a prototype to demo the new tech to Sony execs.</p><p>I'll freely admit it took me a bit to understand why I cared to give it more than a passing glance.</p>

<p>Everyone has a moment when they realize what's been bothering them, that thing they haven't been able to put a finger on. I play PC games, so this is sort of my moment.</p><p>You may love it or loathe it, but a large part of a AAA mega-million-dollar video game is storytelling. AI can't tell a story unless a person tells it what to say. AI has no experience to draw from. It has no original thoughts or ideas. It can't like or dislike something, so it can't convey that message to us. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/can-googles-lamda-chatbot-actually-be-sentient">AI is a stupid robot programmed to say smart things by smart people</a>. Nothing more.</p>
<p>Burch's fears that this will negatively affect the game industry are valid for the actors and writers who work hard to create the things we love. I'm not one of them. I'm just a person who buys and plays said games. I have my own thoughts from that perspective.</p><p>AI is here and it's not going away. Consumer-facing gimmicks will soon wear thin and be less in our faces, but the technology is here to stay. AI will be able to take your job even though it will never be very good at doing it. AI can write code but it can't write good, original code. AI can write articles like this one, but it will never have an opinion. AI can never replace the human factor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RkZAbAca5q4HDicpjxqLk" name="Google-Assistant-sentience.jpg" alt="Hey Google, are you human?" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RkZAbAca5q4HDicpjxqLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sometimes, we want that human factor. I'm more about the action when I play a game than the story, but I want to hear from actors who can put feelings into their work, not from a robot. I think never is a strong word, but I can't see AI doing that unless someone invents something impossible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-flagship-phones-might-get-a-battery-boosting-ai-feature">AI will be there to help you with your battery life </a>or try to find what you're searching for, and it will do a great job. Eventually. It has a long way to go before it can tell me how it feels.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Android 15 is the latest flavor of Google's smartphone operating system, and like most software, it's constantly evolving and changing based on user feedback. The most recent feature drop brought some new features to Pixel phones and watches, one of them being Modes. Google now lets you create custom modes on a Pixel phone and access it through a dedicated menu from the quick settings screen.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 feature drop</a> adds a new quick toggle option called "Modes," which groups Do Not Disturb, Bedtime, and Driving toggles under a single menu. If you have a Pixel phone, here's how you can access it and use it. The following steps were tested on a Pixel 6a running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, but it should be the same for any other Pixel too running the latest Android build.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-access-and-set-up-modes-2">How to access and set up Modes</h2>
<p>1. Perform a swipe-down gesture anywhere on the home screen or from the top edge of the screen till you see the quick settings buttons. You should see <strong>Modes</strong> as the fourth option.</p><p>2. Tap it once to access the pop-out menu. Here, you'll have the three default modes of <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong>, <strong>Bedtime</strong>, and <strong>Driving</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap any one of these modes to activate it. You can have multiple modes active at the same time.</p><p>4. In order to customize any mode, simply long press them, and you'll be taken to the customization menu.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-create-a-custom-mode-2">How to create a custom Mode</h2>
<p>1. Follow the first step from above to get to the <strong>Modes</strong> menu via quick settings.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Settings</strong> in the bottom left corner.</p><p>3. Tap the last option which says <strong>Create your own mode</strong>.</p><p>4. Choose <strong>Custom</strong> to create a mode from scratch. You can also enable <strong>Flip to shhh </strong>from here, which automatically puts your phone in DnD when you flip it face-down on a table. DnD is disabled the next time you pick it up.</p><p>4. If you chose Custom, you can now choose a symbol for your custom mode that best describes the activity. For this example, I've chosen a ticket stub since I've created a profile for when I'm at the cinema.</p><p>5. You can give a custom name to your profile, like Movies, in this case. Tap <strong>Done</strong> when finished.</p><p>6. Next, you'll be taken to a customization page similar to the default profiles. You can set it to turn on automatically based on a specific date and time or based on calendar events.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>There's no way to revert your choice when choosing to activate a mode automatically based on calendar events or date and time, which is a strange limitation. Your only option is to delete the profile and start over.</p>

<p>7. You can also choose which contacts are allowed to interrupt your mode. Starred contacts are added here by default. Other interruptions from apps, reminders, alarms, etc., can also be controlled.</p><p>8. Finally, the <strong>Display settings</strong> option lets you choose what happens to the display when the mode is active, like dimming the wallpaper, enable grayscale, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="modes-organizes-all-your-routines-in-one-place-2">Modes organizes all your routines in one place</h2>
<p>Pixels make up some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, and Google is trying to enhance the user experience with Modes. Now that you have the ability to create tens of custom Modes, having quick access through a dedicated menu makes a lot of sense.</p><p>However, in doing so, we've lost the ability to directly enable Do Not Disturb or Bedtime with a single tap. It's now an extra step to toggle these modes on or off, which has irked many Pixel users, as this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j4cjiu/modes_in_new_pixel_8_update/">Reddit thread</a> shows.</p><p>Of all the modes, I think Do Not Disturb is one that many of us use the most, and if you don't have a dedicated button to enable it, like on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, this additional step can be annoying. I personally never manually toggle Bedtime mode as it automatically engages at night, and it's the same with Driving mode, which kicks in every time Android Auto starts up.</p><p>For people who love having custom profiles set up for different activities, the new Modes shortcut menu is a blessing. We just wish Google would give us the option to keep Do Not Disturb as a standalone shortcut button, but perhaps future iterations will improve on this feature.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next generation of PebbleOS smartwatches is finally here as two new devices greet users today (Mar. 18).</p><p>Pebble's original founder, Eric Migicovsky, published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/introducing-two-new-pebbleos-watches">a new blog post</a> to announce the arrival of what users have been waiting for: the Core 2 Duo and Time 2 smartwatches. These devices are launching under Migicovsky's new company, Core Devices, as it looks to lead the way into the next generation of PebbleOS-ready wearables. Migicovsky states both watches are compatible with "thousands of your beloved Pebble apps."</p><p>Leading the launch today is the Time 2 with a 1.5-inch e-paper display (also a touch screen). The post states this should give consumers "more room" for viewing text and other details on their wrists. Covering this soft display will be a piece of flat glass, which Core Devices states will deliver "less glare and reflections" than its older watches.</p><p>Surrounding this e-paper display will be a metal frame outfitted with physical buttons.</p><p>Overall, Core Devices says the Time 2 is slightly bigger to accommodate its 53% larger display with 88% more pixels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RGF2pic7x6nBKXEenyJqLH" name="core-devices-pebbleos-time-2-black" alt="The Time 2 smartwatch by Core Devices in black with a color e-paper display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGF2pic7x6nBKXEenyJqLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1282" height="721" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The blog post claims the Time 2 will have an incredible 30-day battery life. The details state this is "estimated," so it's not presently clear if the watch will reach this number or not. The specs also do not make the battery capacity of the Time 2 either.</p><p>Underneath it all, the Time 2 contains a heart rate monitor, as well as step and sleep-tracking capabilities. Core Devices has provided the watch with water resistance at an IPX8 rating, too. The device also sports a microphone and speaker.</p><p>The announcement post teases a bit of its software, stating the Time 2 can run over 10,000 Pebble apps and watch faces. with PebbleOS. Users will have access to "notifications, timeline, watch faces, alarms, timers, calendar, music control, basic fitness tracking," and more. Aesthetically, the Time 2 will feature a 22mm strap and will be available in black and white; however, Core Devices states there will be a third color option finalized at a later date.</p><p>The Time 2 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">available for pre-orders today</a> (Mar. 18) for $225 ahead of its shipping date in December. Migicovsky states pre-ordering is the only way to receive this device as it will not be sold in stores. Quantities are limited, so keep this in mind if you're interested so you can act accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-2-duo-2">The Core 2 Duo</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:739px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:81.19%;"><img id="eQubAEHinnKfp48Au3YNAD" name="core-devices-pebbleos-core-2-duo-white" alt="An image of the Core 2 Duo in white against an orange background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQubAEHinnKfp48Au3YNAD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="739" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second watch is the Core 2 Duo, a watch that Migicovsky claims is pretty identical to the Pebble 2 — but it's been upgraded. On the surface, the Core 2 Duo features a smaller 1.2-inch black and white e-paper display. Encasing it will be a lightweight polycarbonate frame with a trio of physical buttons. Like the Time 2, Core Devices states it is "targeting" an IPX8 water-resistant rating.</p><p>A microphone, step, and sleep-tracking capabilities continue to remain on the Core 2 Duo like the older Pebble 2.</p><p>The upgrades Core Devices alluded to include a 30-day battery life, a speaker, a barometer, and a compass sensor.</p><p>As you'd expect, the Core 2 Duo rocks the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">open-source PebbleOS</a> like its larger partner. This gives users looking to purchase this device access to a slew of similar features, as well as 10,000 Pebble apps and watch faces.</p><p>The Core 2 Duo is available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://store.repebble.com/">for pre-order</a> today, too, in white and black for $149. This watch will ship much earlier in July for consumers. The company urges speed again from consumers interested in this device due to its limited quantities like the Time 2. The post states this is due to a "limited supply of display inventory."</p>

But there’s no denying that there are times when they can come in too fast and too furious and be pretty distracting. This might be when you’re in a meeting, and a personal group conversation is blowing up, or when you turn your phone back on after having it in Airplane Mode for a long flight, and your phone goes mad, alerting you to everything you missed.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-notification-cooldown">Notification Cooldown</a> is a new feature available with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 Android 15 update</a>. It’s designed to help you manage an influx of notifications, minimizing sound interruptions and on-screen pop-ups. It’s easy to set up in just a few clicks.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-enable-notification-cooldown-on-a-google-pixel-2">How to enable Notification Cooldown on a Google Pixel</h2>
<p>1. Open <strong>Settings</strong> on your Google Pixel device.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Notifications</strong>.</p><p>3.

<h2 id="how-does-notification-cooldown-on-a-google-pixel-work-2">How does Notification Cooldown on a Google Pixel work?</h2>
<p>Notifications Cooldown works by counting how many notifications you get within a short period. If that exceeds a certain threshold, the phone’s volume will lower, and the alerts will be minimized for up to two minutes. You can’t change the threshold, but you can leave it in Google’s capable hands to determine what’s too much.</p><p>While Notification Cooldown can temporarily shush the notifications you don’t really need right away on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, including those from both Google Pixel and other brands, there are some exceptions. It will not silence calls, alarms, priority conversations, and emergency alerts. That’s a good thing, of course, allowing you to quiet things like social media likes and comments and unimportant daily reminders while ensuring you don’t miss crucial happenings or details about your day.</p><p>It's a great way to still be notified of what’s important without having to turn your phone on silent to avoid an unexpected barrage of messages or other notifications that don’t require your immediate attention.</p><p>Notification Cooldown was made available to Pixel phones as a quarterly release with Android 15 and will continue to be a core part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-has-a-new-trick-to-put-a-damper-on-annoying-app-pings">Android 16</a> once it is released in Q2 2025. For now, as long as your Pixel device is updated to the latest version of Android 15, you’ll see the option in the menu and be able to enjoy its benefits.</p><p>Once set up, friends, family members, and co-workers won’t think you’re a secret spy getting intelligence on the fly when it’s really just ongoing team chatter about snacks for the weekend game or your recent X post getting a ton of attention.</p>

<hr>
<p>Circular announces a couple of new features for its smart ring that could help users better understand their health.</p><p>According to a press release, Circular states it is preparing to bring two features to its Ring 2: Blood Pressure and Glucose monitoring. The company says both features will arrive to assist users in a "non-invasive" way to provide "deeper insight into your health." To get this done, the post states the Blood Pressure (BP) update will arrive this year through an OTA (over the air) update for the Ring 2.</p><p>However, Circular claims it's stepping up its ring's accuracy by combining ECG and PPG technology. In theory, this is said to "enable spot blood pressure measurements," which Circular states will make its Ring 2 the "first smart ring to achieve this."</p><p>Additionally, Circular says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">the Ring 2</a> will receive PTT (Pulse Transit Time), detailing how long it takes blood to travel through your arteries. The company says its "quick measurements" can take anywhere from 30 seconds to two minutes, but are designed to offer you an insightful glimpse into the state of your blood pressure.</p><p>Circular announces its consumers can expect its Blood Pressure update in "late 2025."</p>

<p>The second major update is the statement that the Circular Ring 2 is preparing to debut a Blood Glucose monitoring update in "late 2026."</p><p>The post claims this update will be "truly groundbreaking," allowing its users to track how their glucose levels fluctuate "without finger-pricks or CGMs." The Ring 2 is said to utilize PPG sensors and Circular's machine-learning software to analyze how light interacts with a person's blood. The Ring 2 will soon activate "consistent readings" — which could take up to two minutes to complete after waking up — to determine your "long-term glucose patterns."</p><p>Circular appears confident that while its glucose monitoring won't replace more traditional monitoring methods, its technology will at least be "valuable." It remains to be seen just how well the Ring 2 will be at understanding and compiling the information needed for <em>accurate </em>glucose trend monitoring.</p><p>Nevertheless, we'll see how things fair late next year.</p><p>An announcement like this precedes the likes of Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">which was teased</a> to have glucose monitoring in the works for a future Galaxy Watch. A Samsung exec, senior vice president Hon Pak, brought awareness to the company's development of non-invasive glucose monitoring. Pak stated the feature would be "optical-based," meaning users won't have to fret about needles.</p><p>Similar to what Circular has said, Samsung's Hon Pak states glucose monitoring will be a "game-changer;" however, that'll only be the case if they "do it right."</p>

<ul><li>Google announced two new features for Gemini that will help users create documents as well as codes within the application.</li><li>Gemini's Canvas allows people to create essays and collaborate with others by exporting their work directly on to Google Docs.</li><li>Canvas also allows users to bring their codes to life, cutting the time taking process of creating codes.</li><li>Gemini is introducing something called Audio Overviews that makes life easier by transforming a boring lengthy document into a fun podcast.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been on a roll lately, announcing changes to its Google Assistant and bolstering more of Gemini in every nook and cranny they find that AI could be used.</p><p>Recently they announced<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced"> several updates to the Gemini app</a>, and expanded Flash 2.0 to many more people. Today (Mar. 18) it has announced two more tools to help users collaborate better with the AI assistant.</p><p>Google detailed in a press release that it is bringing a new interactive space to house your documents, called "Canvas.” This tool will help users collaborate with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, while they write essays, blog posts, research papers, and so on. Canvas lets you "create, draft, edit, and refine docs or code in a single space," but with the power of Gemini. Imagine Gemini to be your invisible sidekick during your assignments, giving you suggestions and edits as and when necessary.</p><p>Canvas can also adjust the tone of your document or even give you suggestions based on the topic in concern, to make the essay or blog post read better. For example, highlight a paragraph and ask Gemini to make it more concise, professional, or informal. This works best when you're drafting an important speech for a presentation, or a creative report. Canvas will fine-tune and personalize the suggestions based on the user's needs.</p><p>While editing on Canvas, the changes are said to show up in real-time. All users have to do is select ‘Canvas’ in Gemini's prompt bar and you can begin writing. Additionally, it allows you to share your work with people who'd like to contribute to the report or blog post— by exporting it to Google Docs, from Gemini itself.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8m4tPaW5THNqTsRUbnfN48" name="Canvas_Docs_SuggestEdits" alt="Canvas editing tool" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8m4tPaW5THNqTsRUbnfN48.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="bringing-your-codes-to-life-2">Bringing your codes to life</h2>
<p>Documents aren't the only thing that can be created on Canvas, according to the tech giant, you can also get thinking like a software developer or programmer. The tool allows users to bring their codes to life by creating an actual "working prototype"—by simplifying the technical process of coding, so users can focus on the creative aspect of the code. This happens within Canvas, without needing to switch between multiple applications, making it more seamless.</p><p>"Within Canvas, you can generate and preview your HTML/React code and other web app prototypes to see a visual representation of your design," the press release added.</p><p>For example, creating email subscriptions for your website becomes much quicker,  "you can ask Gemini to generate the HTML for the form and then preview how it will appear and function within your web app." All the user needs to fill in the input fields or add call-to-action buttons. Canvas will also give you a quick preview of what your code will look like instantly.</p>

<p>Audio Overviews is a feature that was previously only on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/notebooklm-audio-overviews/">NotebookLM,</a> and now Google is bringing it to Gemini after several users were keen on testing it out.</p><p>As the name suggests this feature is said to transform boring, lengthy documents into podcasts that are not just easy to understand but are also interactive and engaging. Imagine not being able to understand a complex topic in class and you're given a PDF with a ton of jargon. That's where Audio Overviews comes in.</p><p>"Gemini will create a podcast-style discussion between two AI hosts who, with just a click, launch into a lively deep-dive conversation based on your uploaded document."</p><p>It won't just tell you what's in the document but will also give you different perspectives on the topic within the document, helping the user understand complex information better and quicker.</p><p>This feature works with all kinds of documents including research papers, lengthy email threads, or reports generated by Deep Research.</p><p>To create an Audio Overview, all you have to do is upload documents or slides and click the <em>suggestion chip</em> that pops up above the prompt bar. Once the podcast is created, it can also be downloaded onto your device.</p>

<p>Both Canvas and Audio Overviews is rolling out globally today for Gemini and Gemini Advanced subscribers. It can be accessed through both the web as well as the Gemini app.</p>

<hr>
<p>Can we just say, better late than never?</p><p>The much-anticipated One UI 7 update of Galaxy devices finally has a launch date. Samsung has announced that the official rollout will begin on April 7.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-official-rollout-of-one-ui-7-starting-from-april-7">announcement post</a>, the first set of devices to experience the latest operating system includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a> series, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>The company further notes that other eligible devices comprising Galaxy S24 FE, Galaxy S23 series, Galaxy S23 FE, and the older Galaxy foldables like Galaxy Z Fold 5 and Z Flip 5 will be receiving the update gradually in the coming weeks. There are also tablets, which will be receiving the update like the Galaxy Tab S9 and the more recent Galaxy Tab S0 series.</p>

<p>Samsung started rolling out the One UI 7 for devices like the Galaxy S24 series in beta last year. The devices have already received a couple of betas over the past few months. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series, however, has been the first set of devices to come with stable Android 15-based One UI 7 out of the box as they launched in January.</p><p>Meanwhile, the predecessor models were expected to be getting the official builds around the same time; it appears Samsung has taken its sweet time to roll out the official builds a couple of months later. Also, this is a first from Samsung — a delayed OS roll-out compared to the previous One UI versions.</p>

<p>Regardless, it is encouraging to see the launch date of One UI 7 despite the delays as the betas have showcased some of the interesting features the operating system is bringing to the Galaxy phones — and it is considered the most notable update compared to last year’s version. The first set of changes that Galaxy users can expect with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> include a simplified Home Screen, redesigned One UI widgets, and a Lock Screen, which additionally provides customizations.</p><p>This new OS will bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a>, which is powered by Galaxy AI sits on the lock screen, and supports real-time updates for apps like Timers, Google Maps, and Spotify, for example. Other notable AI features comprise AI Select, Writing Assist, Drawing Assist, and Audio Eraser. Google’s Gemini integration is also expected to be another notable improvement with the One UI 7 update.</p>

<hr>
<p>Roku users have started noticing a new and pretty intrusive ad tactic popping up over the past few days, and, as you’d expect, people aren’t happy about it.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/roku-says-unpopular-autoplay-ads-are-just-a-test/" target="_blank">Ars Technica</a> reports that some Roku users are now getting hit with ads before the home screen even shows up. While Roku is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/roku-ceo-video-ads-home-screen-confirmed">no stranger to sprinkling ads around the home screen</a>, this new move takes it up a notch, forcing folks to sit through video ads just to get to their usual setup.</p><p>Roku confirmed to Ars Technica that these autoplay ads are part of an official test. However, the company remains tight-lipped on how many devices are affected, why it is rolling this out, or whether it’s here to stay for good.</p><p>Instead of admitting it might’ve gone too far, Roku said it's all about constant experimentation and innovation, whether it’s tweaking the interface, expanding content, or revamping its ad strategy.</p>
<h2 id="skippable-or-not-depends-who-you-ask-2">Skippable or not? Depends who you ask</h2>
<p>Early reports suggested these ads couldn’t be skipped, but Roku told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/roku-tests-unskippable-home-screen-video-ads-before-you-can-use-your-roku/" target="_blank">Cord Cutter News</a> that there is a way to close them. However, Ars Technica has shared user experiences where that option seemed to be missing. So, it’s a bit of a mixed bag.</p><p>The move to force autoplaying video ads before users can even get to the home screen has, unsurprisingly, sparked a wave of frustration. Frustrated users are venting on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Roku/comments/1jcuibl/question_about_ads/" target="_blank">Reddit</a>, with some saying they were stuck watching promos—like the Moana 2 trailer—before they could open their apps.</p><p>Roku started shifting away from static home screen ads <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/roku-will-be-adding-new-video-ads-to-its-home-screen/" target="_blank">in early 2024</a>, cranking up the ad pressure on users. But it's not alone; other platforms are doing the same. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a>, for example, recently rolled out ads that literally advertise more ads, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-is-showing-ads-for-ads-this-week/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>.</p><p>No matter the brand, a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming platforms</a> are constantly testing how much advertising users will put up with, especially when it comes to cheap streaming devices.</p>

<p>There are various solutions that manufacturers themselves have implemented, built into your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-will-tell-you-just-how-long-youve-been-scrolling-with-new-screen-time-reminders" target="_blank">mobile OS under their "Screen Time"</a> or "Digital Wellbeing" menus. You may even have access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-priority-mode-qpr1-detailed" target="_blank">"Focus Modes" </a>that allow you to turn apps and their notifications off to minimize distractions. While that’s great, I’ve often found that you must replace a thing you’re removing from your life with a healthy alternative for that change to be long-term.</p><p>Then there's the Neurable approach, which relies on gamification and technology to <em><strong>undo</strong></em> the problems they have created while also helping you train your attention span.</p><p>This could be that rare exception of the problem also being the solution. Hear me out!</p>

<p>In 2017, neurotech startup Neurable unveiled the world's first brain-controlled VR game at the SIGGRAPH conference in partnership with VR graphics company estudiofuture.</p><p>That year, they had their gear pared down and paired with an HTC Vive, but it's taken almost ten years of iterating to go from the Neurable Electrode Reduction headgear in the image below (right) to the HTC Vive model to their current retail offering, the MW75 Neuro wireless ANC headphones (pictured below, left).</p>

<p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw75-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones">purchase the standard Master & Dynamic MW75</a> for $599 on the Master & Dynamic for just website. However, the partnership with Neurable adds $100 to that price, meaning you pay $699 for the MW75 Neuro, which you can purchase from both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neurable.com/products?variant=45976725881078#buy-box">Neurable website</a> and from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw75-neuro">Master & Dynamic</a>, although the latter has fewer color options.

<h2 id="the-hardware-2">The hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="sjAKV42pqf4sDaBi7GTtGA" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-headphones-in-case.JPG" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro, showing everything that comes in the hard case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sjAKV42pqf4sDaBi7GTtGA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MW75 was already an excellent piece of hardware. It's an audiophile-grade pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth headphones</a> that you can also use wired. At that price point, you get elevated physical details, which include easily replaceable earpads, leather, a sturdy build that makes the headphones feel a bit heavy, and mechanical buttons that have a reassuring tactile click.</p><p>Sonically, you get a balanced sound that doesn't sacrifice bass response or clarity to deliver an entertaining and illuminating experience. The bass isn't ultra-dark but gives you enough rumble to keep things fun.</p><p>The highs and mids aren't fatiguing, but the soundstage and instrument separation are expansive and teeter toward analytical when paired with the right wired mobile DAC/amp. My only issue with them is their earcup size.</p><p>I have to make sure they're over my ears because they're a bit of a tight fit for me, and if I don't place them very intentionally, they tend to sit on my ears a bit instead of against my skull, just around my ears.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RA7HrWF99NqXMNWqYbXX8" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-on-head" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RA7HrWF99NqXMNWqYbXX8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The other features are solid, too. The ANC is very strong. Using physical buttons so that you rarely need to touch your phone is well thought out. And the microphones that allow you to take calls are clear and crisp and don't make you sound like you're in a closet.</p><p>The only downside is that the noisier my environment got, the harder callers said it was to hear me, so there was no background noise cancellation.</p><p>Aside from that, the MW75 Neuro also comes with all the accessories you'll need in the beautifully appointed hard case. Inside that case, you'll find a USB-C charge cable that supports audio pass-thru, a 3.5m aux cable, a 1/4" adapter, and a USB-A adapter if you're using a device or older computer that doesn't have USB-C ports.</p><p>All of that before we even talk about the 12 channels of EEG through the EEG sensors embedded in the modified earpads. Master & Dynamics' OEM MW75 comes with leather earpads, but Neurable went with swappable fabric earpads to accommodate the sensors.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Zj58ErHuDgzb6QLTwAfHvA" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-earcups-sensors-removed.JPG" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro showing EEG sensors and connections" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zj58ErHuDgzb6QLTwAfHvA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Neurable MW75 Neuro showing EEG sensors and connections </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the heart of this is Neurable AI, the brainchild of Neurable CEO and co-founder Dr. Ramses Alcaide and his team. In very simple terms, they use algorithms to turn your brainwave data into actionable insights so that you can retrain yourself to focus better on tasks.</p><p>You get all that info in the Neurable app, which is available for iOS and Android. I've used both for over two months and have been quite impressed with the experience.</p><p>The ultimate goal of Neurable AI and the app is to help you achieve better sustained focus when needed. But first, “focus” must be defined. Neurable uses the definition from one of the leading experts in the field, Dr. Gloria Mark:</p><p>"Focus represents a temporal state when people feel absorbed in an activity, and the activity generally requires some degree of challenge to a person’s skill set. Being highly engaged and challenged in work is correlated with motivation, activation, concentration, creativity, and satisfaction."</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Pro tip</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">This is also a fun party trick. In real-time, you'll see how your brain activity influences the rocket.</p></div></div>
<p>After you've created an account, paired the MW75 Neuro, and gone through the tutorial, your introduction to Neurable focus will be a novel rocket game. Start the game, and you'll see a rocket ship on screen. The better you focus on it, the faster it will fly through the air.</p><p>The Neurable app has three tabs at the bottom of the page: Home, Sessions, My Focus, and Settings. Home is where you'll see messages on improving your focus, stats from your last focus session, and insights the AI has compiled based on your session history. You'll also start a focus session from the Home tab.</p><p>The Sessions tab is where you'll see a running log of your previous sessions, which you can click on. Then, you can see the Session Summary for each logged entry. The My Focus tab is where you'll see the bar graphs of your cumulative focus scores and time spent in various focus levels by day and week.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I'm very competitive, so the placebo effect was initially in full effect. Knowing my focus was being monitored was enough to get me to finally set up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-zen-mode-motorola-unplugged-samsung-relax">focus mode on my Android phone</a> to keep the many pings and tings at bay while I give whatever task the attention it deserves. That was great for the first couple of sessions, but after that, the old habit came back, and the real trials with Neurable began.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review" target="_blank">I wrote reviews</a>, balanced my finances, and did research, all while either listening to Lo-fi hip-hop to aid in focus (something I'd been doing for some time prior to my Neurable test) or no music at all. It appeared the app accurately tracked my focus as I got work done or was distracted.</p><p>During two of my longest sessions, an hour and a half and two and a half hours, it was easy to see when FOMO and phone checking interrupted my attention span. On the other hand, it was also very easy to see when I was locked in, and the writing flowed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rYttCMpj5MuKsZM4FKnKuX" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-app-composite" alt="Neurable app composite image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYttCMpj5MuKsZM4FKnKuX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The insights I've gleaned from the app and Neurable AI are that I tend to focus best in the afternoon and when I've chosen "Other" as my activity when beginning a focus session. My longest attention span was about an hour long, and my most extended focus session was two and a half hours. I definitely felt locked in and more productive.</p><p>I've come to look at Neurable like I do my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch</a> and its notifications: it's a good nag. It's placing my lack of focus right in my face so that I address it right there, at the moment. The difference is that this isn't any sort of alert to stand up because I've been sitting too long or a low fitness warning, but instead, the entire exercise of having sessions of focus is my alert. My "warning."</p><p>That said, there is a "stand alert" of sorts in the app. When in a Focus Session, you'll be alerted when your focus has been low for too long or when you've been working too long, and your focus is beginning to suffer. At that time, you'll be prompted to take a "brain break."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Neurable is great at "nagging" me when it detects my focus is low, prompting me to take a "break break" from time to time.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The point of that is to relax for a moment so you can come back to your work, refocused and productive, and it absolutely works for me. When I took brain breaks, I could see that the graph was back at high focus afterward but was more scattered in the level of attention shown if I didn't take any breaks.</p><p>Being intentional about a goal generally brings with it measurable results. Ultimately, what the MW75 and Neurable AI do is help you cultivate focus.</p><p>Eventually, you won't need Neurable because it will help train you to increase your attention span and give sustained periods of singular focus to those tasks that require it.</p><p>That's the difference between what Neurable AI and screen time or digital well-being in an OS provides. The latter only tells you when you've spent too much time in distraction land, which is also a good thing, but it's the ability of the former to retrain the amount of attention you give to those distractions and the quality of your focus time spent on those tasks you've identified as priorities in your life.</p>
<h2 id="verdict-2">Verdict</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KYWp5peAAddgVAAMftiXQA" name="neurable-mw75-neuro-earcup-branding.JPG" alt="Neurable MW75 Neuro showing the EEG contacts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KYWp5peAAddgVAAMftiXQA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The MW75 Neuro and Neurable AI are fantastic technological achievements that could be beneficial to a lot of people. Those who deal with various forms of ADHD and any other issues that keep them from achieving the level of focus they’d like to give to their tasks will benefit from tech like this.</p><p>Just like medical journals have found fitness trackers and smartwatches do help users increase their physical health by encouraging them to simply take 10k steps, the focus Neurable helps you put on your focus should net positive results.</p><p>The primary issue here is how new the tech is and how costly it is. At $700, this tech is inaccessible for many. Especially in the current economic climate and social instability that many may find themselves in.</p><p>Two things need to happen here: Neurable works with insurers to have this tech be FSA approved, and producing the EEG tech becomes cheaper so that Neurable’s next product is in the $200 price range.</p><p>On the latter point, I would love to see a partnership with a company like Soundcore, JBL, or 1More, as this would be an easy way to bring its brain wave tracking technology to more people. Fortunately, Neurable assures me that better access is one of its goals, and this is just the beginning.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I liked using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apple-iphone-se-2022-review">iPhone SE 2022</a>; while it was based on an older design, the refreshed internals and the diminutive design made it a fun device, and it was affordable. With the iPhone 16e, Apple is looking to update that formula; the phone has a bigger profile and includes Face ID as standard, and it gets USB-C connectivity. There's a bigger battery than the one in the iPhone 16, and as it is powered by the same A18 platform, it comes with all the Apple Intelligence features. <br><br>All of these upgrades come at a cost, with the iPhone 16e starting at $599. That puts it uncomfortably close to last year's iPhone 15, and while it does a great job with the fundamentals, it misses out on extras: you don't get a secondary camera at the back, there's no MagSafe, and the panel is still 60Hz. <br><br>But if you're on an older iPhone and looking to upgrade, there are enough new features on the iPhone 16e that make it a decent choice — if you don't mind the high asking price.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled the iPhone 16e on February 19, 2025, and the device went on sale globally starting February 28. It starts at $599 in the U.S., £599 ($775) in the U.K. and €699 ($761) in other countries in the region, and ₹59,990 ($690) in India. The standard model comes with 128GB of storage, and you also get 256GB and 512GB variants. The iPhone 16e is available in white and black options, and this is what the device costs around the world:</p>
<ul><li>iPhone 16e (128GB): $599 / £599 / €699 / ₹59,990</li><li>iPhone 16e (256GB): $699 / £699 / €829 / ₹69,990</li><li>iPhone 16e (512GB): $899 / £899 / €1,029 / ₹89,990</li></ul>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-design"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jKZtFwWkDTpy8uZFdAVp4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jKZtFwWkDTpy8uZFdAVp4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e uses the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 as the foundation for the design, and the device has the exact same dimensions. It isn't quite as small as the iPhone SE 2022, and that's ultimately a good thing — that 4.7-inch size was getting too small anyway. The iPhone 16e has a good in-hand feel, and even though it has a bigger battery than the iPhone 13, it is a smidgen lighter, and that's always a good thing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3j6MWkLnr5uVRXsoxaMGzd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The positioning of the power and volume buttons is unchanged, and what I like is that the Action button from the iPhone 15 is available on the device. The button is just as customizable, and you can use it as a flashlight toggle, switching to silent mode, changing Focus modes, dictating notes, launching the camera, real-time translations, or a custom control.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cr9HJgSyMBtHZ4q3YCj43e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cr9HJgSyMBtHZ4q3YCj43e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I find the Action button to be the easiest way to toggle Focus modes, and I'm glad the feature is available on this device. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-15-pro-max-long-term-review">iPhone 15</a> feature that trickled down to the device is the USB-C port; the iPhone 16e marks the end of the Lightning port, with all of the devices in Apple's portfolio now coming with USB-C. This is a positive move, and makes charging the 16e significantly easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The one feature that didn't make its way over is the notch; the iPhone 16e uses the older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/iphone-13-review">iPhone 13</a>-style cutout and not the Dynamic Island that debuted on the iPhone 14 Pro and subsequent models. The older notch is distracting, and doesn't quite blend into the background as well as Dynamic Island. I find myself using the feature to easily control music playback on my iPhone 16 Pro Max, and not being able to do that here was irksome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="o9xvZ6MUoZp9HJUCzG5QPe" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9xvZ6MUoZp9HJUCzG5QPe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another issue is with the choice of colors. The iPhone 16e is available in just white and black color options, and it misses out on the red variant that looked gorgeous on the SE 2022. Obviously, you can deck the device out in colorful cases, but as someone who doesn't use cases, I wanted a color option that stood out a bit more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bdHidmdjPdt2dqi5d5qw4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bdHidmdjPdt2dqi5d5qw4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the build quality itself is terrific (as you'd imagine), with the phone getting an aluminum mid-frame sandwiched between two panes of glass. The back has a frosted glass finish that feels great, and as an added bonus, it doesn't pick up smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MiaW6V9vfHRVSBmp8rR86e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MiaW6V9vfHRVSBmp8rR86e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a single camera at the back, and the lens doesn't call out much attention to itself — in what is a stark contrast to the massive camera lenses that are a mainstay on all Android phones. The mid-frame has a matte texture that makes holding the phone just that bit easier.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AJpR3ZTHGWxpUaQ6nPPu5e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJpR3ZTHGWxpUaQ6nPPu5e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a SIM card slot in global models of the device (just like the iPhone 16), but the U.S. version is limited to eSIM connectivity, but you can use two eSIMs at the same time. Another standard feature is IP68 ingress protection, with the device getting the ability to withstand submersion in up to six meters of water. <br><br>Although the design of the iPhone 16e is familiar, it has enough differentiated features from newer models that it stands out from the regular iPhone 13 and 14.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-display"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tGEduPpyiukhH2uMWYa88e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tGEduPpyiukhH2uMWYa88e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the same 6.1-inch OLED panel as the iPhone 13 and 14, and like those devices (and the iPhone 16), it is limited to 60Hz. It's annoying that 120Hz is still limited to the iPhone Pro models, particularly considering that budget Android phones also come with 120Hz as standard these days. It is a limitation on the iPhone 16e, and you can easily feel the difference when using it next to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or any Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RNcvEBCB9v7VSUJpKsvU3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNcvEBCB9v7VSUJpKsvU3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel is protected by Ceramic Shield, and it holds up to tumbles incredibly well. My 21-month-old daughter decided to throw the phone around the moment I unboxed it (she likes doing that), and it came away unscathed. You get True Tone and Dolby Vision alongside HDR10, and it has good brightness levels; while it isn't on par with the iPhone 16 or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9</a>, the 16e does a good job in this regard, and I didn't see any problems viewing the panel under harsh sunlight.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are detailed, and contrast is excellent. In fact, the only other annoyance with the panel is that there's no always-on mode — that's again limited to the Pro models. The 6.1-inch size has been around a while now on iPhones, and going with this panel makes sense; although the notch is of an older style, it is immediately familiar. <br><br>Talking about the notch, it houses the requisite modules to enable Face ID, and it is just as fast and fluid as every other iPhone I've used when it comes to authentication. It also has the secondary speaker and camera, and they both do a good job.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-performance"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Performance</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CfwHPMAhKET8Vh6Pgcp4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CfwHPMAhKET8Vh6Pgcp4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The key differentiator with the iPhone 16e is that it is powered by the same A18 platform as the regular iPhone 16 models. This gives the device a huge advantage, and although it is using a binned version of the chip that sees a quad-core GPU in lieu of the five that's standard on the other models, the rest of the features are identical. The phone also gets 8GB of RAM as standard, and again, this is higher than what's available with the iPhone 14 and 15. <br><br>The phone starts with 128GB of storage on the base model, and it can be configured with 256GB or 512GB. I'm using the 512GB edition, and it is just as fluid as the iPhone 16 in daily use. It handles demanding games with ease, delivering stable framerates without any lag. If anything, the 60Hz panel holds the device back, and it's clear that it is able to push higher framerates without taxing the internals too much.</p>

<p>There are no issues with overheating either, and overall, the phone does a fantastic job in this regard. The switch to USB-C means you can use a single cable to charge all of your devices, and while you don't get fast data transmission — it is limited to 480Mbit/sec — it is much better than using Lightning. <br><br>The iPhone 16e gets all the extras that are included on the iPhone 16, such as Emergency SOS, roadside assistance, and Find My via satellite, as well as crash detection. Interestingly, the iPhone 16e sees the debut of the C1, an in-house modem built by Apple that takes over from the Qualcomm-based solutions used in all other iPhones.</p>
<p>The modem doesn't have mmWave connectivity, but it has better efficiency figures, and this is evident while testing, with the iPhone 16e eking out better battery life than the iPhone 16. I didn't see any issues with connectivity or signal quality between the two devices, and it will be interesting to see if Apple is able to scale the tech to its entire iPhone portfolio. <br><br>Overall, the iPhone 16e is the fastest phone in its category, and if you're coming from an older device, you'll love what it can deliver.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-battery-life"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Battery life</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a sizeable 3,961mAh battery, and it lasts longer than any iPhone outside of the Pro Max models. Thanks to the bigger battery and efficient A18 platform, the phone manages to last over a day with relative ease, and even with heavy use, I got to the night with over 15% left. <br><br>There's no question that the iPhone 16e has an edge over the iPhone 16 and iPhone 15 when it comes to battery life, and if you need a 6.1-inch iPhone that lasts all day, this is the one to get. I also like that it charges over USB-C; this was a point of contention with the iPhone SE 2022, and I'm glad it isn't a problem with the 16e. <br><br>Like other iPhones, you don't get a charger in the box, and the charging is limited to 20W. The phone gets to the 50% mark in under 30 minutes, but it takes close to two hours to charge the battery using a standard USB PD charger, and unlike most Android phones, I left it plugged in overnight because of the lengthy charging times. <br><br>Another annoyance is that there isn't MagSafe, so if you've invested in the accessory ecosystem, you won't be able to use those with the iPhone 16e. That said, the phone goes up to 7.5W over the Qi standard, so if you have a charging mat, you can use it with the device — it just doesn't go up to 25W over MagSafe like the iPhone 16.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-cameras"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAxgw9UXYHntcU5neuKQ4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has the unwelcome distinction of being the only phone I tested in recent years to feature a single camera at the back. The phone has a 48MP camera with OIS, and while it uses in-sensor zoom to deliver the same caliber of shots at 2x, that's about as versatile as it gets. <br><br>The phone misses out on the new Photographic Styles that debuted with the iPhone 16, instead defaulting to the older system where you can pick between five choices. You still get a decent customizability in this regard, but it isn't quite what you get on the other iPhone 16 models. Similarly, there's no Cinematic mode or Action mode, but you get slow-motion video and the ability to shoot 4K60 footage. <br><br>The camera interface itself is identical to every other iPhone, with the shooting modes at the bottom, and the various toggles around the viewfinder. Thankfully, Audio Mix is intact, giving you much greater control while shooting videos, and there's Night mode when taking photos.</p>

<p>While it's not quite as good as the iPhone 16, the 16e manages to take good photos in any situation. Daylight shots have good detail rendition and colors, and the camera does a decent job in low-light, with the dedicated Night mode making a difference in this regard. <br><br>That said, the limited versatility is the biggest downside of the iPhone 16e; not having a wide-angle or telephoto lens is a big enough disadvantage that I'd suggest getting the iPhone 15 if you need auxiliary cameras. The 48MP camera does a good job at 2x as well, but go beyond that and you start to see visible noise.</p>

<p>The iPhone 16e comes with iOS 18.3 out of the box, and my unit got an update to 18.3.1 shortly after I set it up. As of writing, the iPhone 16e is the most affordable device with Apple Intelligence. Apple is pushing its AI suite as a differentiator, and while most of the features are still in beta, there's plenty of great potential. I'll be honest; I wouldn't have used anywhere as much AI features if Apple didn't showcase them at an event in Mumbai, India shortly after the debut of the iPhone 16e.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZXBEoUaJnpr5PmYY3ZvR4e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXBEoUaJnpr5PmYY3ZvR4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm ambivalent toward generative AI in general, but I'll admit that the iPhone 16e has one of the strongest AI-assisted feature-set of any device today. Visual Intelligence is Apple's answer to Google Lens, and it does a good job identifying locations, objects, and just about anything you look up. It is easy to use — it can be launched via the Action button, lock screen, or Control Center — and gives you decent information of the world around you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6WAVbWq2LZuptCUXZGzr6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6WAVbWq2LZuptCUXZGzr6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In a similar vein, Writing Tools assist with proofreading and summarizing text, and you can use the built-in features to rewrite existing text. There's also the option to create unique images with text prompts via Image Playground, and custom emoji with Genmoji. You get the usual image-editing tools as well, and even if you don't use most of these features, it's clear that this is what Apple believes will make its products stand out.</p>

<p>Outside of the AI features, there isn't much new with iOS 18. The visuals have a slight refresh, but the UI as a whole should be immediately recognizable if you're coming from an older iPhone. There's a Control Center that houses all the usual toggles, and it is paginated now, giving you better access to customize media and any other controls. Focus mode is great to cut out distractions, and you get the usual privacy tools baked in.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7N95QvnpPBdHdGVPGXrv6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7N95QvnpPBdHdGVPGXrv6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The software is designed to be familiar while offering new tools. And as is the case with all iPhones, the iPhone 16e will pick up five iOS updates. Unlike most Android phones, there's no waiting to get the update (looking at you, Samsung); all iPhones can download the latest iOS version as soon as it is available.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wBJ4mWFGwn8YEdLhqhdL5e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wBJ4mWFGwn8YEdLhqhdL5e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 15 is the closest alternative to the 16e. It costs an additional $100, but you get a cleaner design with Dynamic Island, two cameras at the back, and MagSafe charging. However, the device doesn't last as long as the iPhone 16e, and you miss out on all the AI features. <br><br>Over on Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is my recommendation. It has a good design, vibrant AMOLED with 120Hz, two terrific cameras at the back, a massive battery with 80W charging, and a good overall value. Google's Pixel 9a should also be a good option to consider, and if it has cameras that are anywhere as good as the 8a, it should be a standout mid-range choice.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-iphone-16e-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPhone 16e: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kkeH2GCd74SdcUTSog5g6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kkeH2GCd74SdcUTSog5g6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need Apple Intelligence</li><li>You want an iPhone with great battery life</li><li>You want terrific performance</li><li>You need Face ID and USB-C</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a wide-angle or tele lens</li><li>You need an iPhone with a 120Hz panel</li><li>You want MagSafe connectivity</li><li>You want a good value</li></ul>
<p>Ultimately, the iPhone 16e is a good phone, but a bad value right now. I can see this phone doing quite well if it sold at $449 or even $499, but at $599 it's hard to justify the asking price when you look at the omissions — the iPhone 15 becomes a better alternative instead. Yes, the iPhone 16e has a 48MP camera at the back, you get the A18 platform, better battery life, and it has all the AI-assisted features that you get in the iPhone 16. <br><br>However, there's just a single camera at the back, and that just isn't enough in 2025 — even entry-level phones have wide-angle lenses these days. Granted, these sensors tend to be average at best and unusable at times, but not including one at all on a $599 phone is a short-sighted move. Similarly, not including a 120Hz panel hobbles the device, and it makes it a poor bargain against Android rivals. <br><br>It's clear that the iPhone 16e is aimed at older iPhones users looking to switch to a (relatively) affordable model with the latest hardware. The inclusion of the A18 and all the AI features make it a decent choice in this regard, and if I'm looking at it purely as a successor to the iPhone SE 2022, it gets a lot right: you get a much bigger screen, significantly improved battery life, much better hardware, and a great camera at the back. <br><br>As an upgrade to the iPhone SE 2022, the iPhone 16e nails the brief. If that's what you're looking for in an iPhone upgrade, then the iPhone 16e is a good choice. Otherwise, the iPhone 15 gives you more value, even if you miss out on Apple Intelligence.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-117">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Seven more Google Assistant features are getting axed, continuing the trend that started in late 2024.</li><li>Google is not giving a heads-up on when these features will vanish. Instead, you’ll get a notification while using them, letting you know they’re about to disappear.</li><li>To soften the blow, Google suggests setting up custom Routines to replicate some of the lost features.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Assistant’s time is ticking as Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">takes over mobile and eventually smart devices</a>, so the tech giant announced the new batch of features on the chopping block.</p><p>With Gemini set to fully take over by the end of 2025, Google is now axing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/13971691?hl=en#zippy=" target="_blank">seven more Assistant features</a>, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/16/google-assistant-losing-features-2025/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This move isn’t exactly surprising, though. Google has been slowly chipping away at Assistant’s capabilities since late 2024, making it clear that the transition is well underway.</p><p>Turns out, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> transition isn’t just happening to Android phones. Google’s smart home lineup, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-speaker">premium smart speakers</a> and smart displays, is also in for some changes.</p><p>After phasing out several Assistant features, Google has now confirmed that more "underutilized features" are getting the axe as part of this transition.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-getting-cut-2">What’s getting cut?</h2>
<p>First off, Google is pulling the plug on the ability to manage photo metadata by voice. That means you won’t be able to favorite, share, or ask about the time and location of photos using voice commands anymore. However, you can still do all of this manually in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, and photo metadata will still be viewable on Smart Displays and tablets.</p><p>Similarly, voice commands for tweaking photo frame and ambient display settings are going away, but you can still adjust them directly through the Smart Display settings.</p><p>Interpreter mode, which provides real-time multilingual translation during conversations, is also getting cut. You’ll still be able to translate single words and phrases, but the live conversation feature is disappearing.</p><p>Google is also removing automatic birthday reminders in Routines, though you can still set them up manually with Assistant commands. Family Bell announcements—scheduled or requested reminders for family broadcasts—are also on the chopping block.</p><p>Additionally, Google is shutting down automatic daily updates like weather reports, but you can still set up custom Routines to get scheduled updates. Lastly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> will no longer work with car accessories connected via Bluetooth or an aux cable.</p>
