In contrast, a similar Anker charging brick with a 100W rating and three ports would usually set you back about $50 or more.</p><p>Prime Day might have a four-day slot this time around, but stock is running out on the best deals, so you might want to act fast.

This particular charger is from the Voltme Revo series. It's really tiny for a three-ported charging brick and comes with foldable prongs, making it even more pocket-friendly.</p><p>The brand incorporated all sorts of surge protection and clever heat management into the brick, making it a safe product. Thanks to GaN III, it doesn't run too hot, and at the same time, the charger maintains a tiny footprint. The Voltme 100W GaN III Charger has one USB Type-A and two USB Type-C ports. It supports QC 3.0, PD 3.0, and PPS fast charging, making it the ideal charger for just about any device, be it a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.</p><p>There are very few reasons why you'd want to skip this deal. The only explanation would be that you either already have such a powerful charger or you're searching for something higher than 100W.</p><p>Don't forget that a charger like this requires a compatible charger to tap into that max 100W charging speed. In fact, any charger over 60W needs a 5A e-marked cable. If that went over your head, don't worry. We have tried and tested the best 100W USB-C cables, and the top five of them are all priced under $10 during Prime Day!

I have a dedicated thermal camera, but it's much more convenient to use a dongle-sized variant that just plugs into your Android phone.</p><p>This is basically what you get with the iSee thermal camera, a diminutive thermal camera that's available with USB-C or Lightning connectors. I used the USB-C model, and it works just as well with any Android phone. The dongle usually sells for $499, but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">Prime Day it is down to $430</a>. This dongle almost never goes on sale, so if you need a diminutive thermal imaging camera, I highly recommend picking it up. And if you need a Lighting-based model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0CYT1553Q">that's down to $433</a>.

It's automatically detected by the iSee mobile app when you connect it to your Android phone, and it accurately detects any heat spots ‚Äî I use it extensively to test how hot phones get while gaming. The resolution of 256x192 isn't the best, but it is more than adequate for a thermal camera, and what I like about the dongle is that it detects minor differences in thermal readings.</p><p>You get a range of presets available, and there's even the ability to shoot 25fps footage. The build quality is fantastic; it has a metal chassis, and I didn't see any issues in the six months I used the product. While there are smaller products available, Fluke's consistently-accurate readings and monitoring tools make the iSee an easy recommendation. As I said above, this dongle doesn't usually go on sale, so if you need a thermal imaging camera to monitor heat zones around the house or identify any leakage issues, you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-TC01B-25Hz-Smartphones-Temperature/dp/B0C9H54GLX">should get it now</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

Thinborn specializes in drop-proofing and ultimate thinness, so the Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 600D Aramid Fiber Case is the best slim case to get for your Fold 7. If you want a different design but similar thinness, the RAPTIC Aramid Fiber Case is also a good option for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>For more budget-conscious buyers, Spigen is the lord and savior. The newly-launched Spigen Airfit Pro MagFit case fits the Fold 7 like a glove while adding intense levels of drop-proofing at the same time.

Configuring it is just as easy as any other Android TV box, and it runs the latest iteration of Google TV. While I'm not a fan of what Google is doing with its TV OS, there isn't any lag or slowdown while using the KM9 Pro Max ‚Äî it is fluid like few boxes in this category.</p><p>You get full access to the Play Store, so you can easily install all your streaming utilities, including Netflix. There's AV1 decode, letting you take full advantage of HDR within YouTube. Although the box comes with 2GB of RAM, I didn't see any issues with lag whatsoever, and Mecool deserves credit for optimizing the UI. You get 32GB of storage as standard.</p><p>The bundled remote has good in-hand feel, and comes with all the buttons you need ‚Äî and yes, there's a mute button. I don't get why most brands omit the mute button, but I'm glad it's there on the KM9 Pro Max. Overall, this is a reliable Android TV solution if you need something on a budget, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/MECOOL-KM9-Pro-Max-Certification/dp/B0DZT22498/">at $63</a>, it delivers a better value than its rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is known for its camera quality, and the Pixel 9 is no slouch. And the photo editing features make it easy to reimagine part of your image, remove distractions, and much more.</p><p>I've used the Pixel 9 on and off since it launched nearly a year ago, designating it as my "camera phone" for moments when I know I'll need a good photo or two. It's just that reliable, and Google has really stepped up the quality of both its hardware and software. You'll also really enjoy the bevy of AI features, which the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip is perfectly capable of handling.</p><p>The biggest omission on the Pixel 9 is the lack of a telephoto lens. However, even then, the AI-enhanced digital zoom does wonders, allowing you to zoom up to 8x with minimal loss of quality. It's things like this that help to fill the gaps, ensuring the Pixel 9 retains as much of a flagship experience as possible.</p><p>You can always pay more for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, or you can pay less for the lower-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>.

This is helpful as some phones and tablets don't have a centered USB-C port, but you also can get by without needing to remove the case.</p><p>Even at its retail price of $99, I'd wholeheartedly recommend the G8 Plus to anyone. But seeing as it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN"><strong>almost 40% off at $63.99</strong></a>, it's an absolute no-brainer.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="105cc10d-aeb8-4bd8-bfc3-213aa69c8557" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check üíµ:¬† $69.99 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="Price check üíµ:¬† $69.99 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$63.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ku9R9PmWg4MuaFeKNBGffg" name="g8-plus.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ku9R9PmWg4MuaFeKNBGffg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The GameSir G8 Plus offers almost everything you could want from a mobile gaming controller.

It starts with only 128GB of base storage, so you'll need to pay even more than that high $899 sticker price to match the Motorola Razr 2024. It's also powered by the Samsung Exynos 2400 chipset, a year-old platform based on the 4nm process that likely isn't much better or worse than the MediaTek chip inside the Razr 2024.</p><p>It's clear that the Razr 2024 is the better choice. It comes with 256GB of base storage by default, features the same 8GB of RAM, has bigger screens, and includes a higher-capacity battery with faster charging speeds. No matter which way you look at it, the Razr 2024 is better overall than the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE ‚Äî even if their costs were equal.</p><p>Of course, they aren't! This deal price for the Razr 2024 brings the flip phone down under $500, whereas the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available for pre-order around the $900 mark. If you were hoping the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE would be your next affordable foldable, fear not, because the Razr 2024 is all that and more.</p><ul><li><em><strong>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out </strong></em><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong></strong></em></li></ul><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-22">Prime Day 2025 Android deals ‚Äî quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2499727057430809917-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Prime Day is here: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Fref_%3Dnav_cs_gb%26bubble-id%3Dcell-phones-accessories%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2203694892823443518-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dtablets%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2511409197821828773-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Chromebooks: </strong><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dchromebooks%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-7106176835731580750-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">up to 28% off Chromebooks</a></li><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-3246680232717780065-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Products from Amazon's own family of devices, which includes Echo smart home tech, Fire TVs, and Kindle e-readers, are also certain to receive major discounts during the four-day sale.</p><h2 id="do-i-have-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-prime-day-2025-2">Do I have to be a Prime member to shop during Prime Day 2025?</h2><p>Although some deals will be available to the general public, the vast majority of Prime Day offers will be exclusive to Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, it might be worth considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>Amazon Prime's 30-day free trial</strong></a>. This gives you access to the full range of Prime benefits (including Prime Day discounts) for a full month without paying a cent.

You know what else is a great phone? The Galaxy Z Flip 6. Last year's flip phone just received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D192WWZ9/">massive $300 Prime Day discount</a>, just in time to make way for Samsung's latest and greatest.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 launched at the same $1,099 price as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, so it's not surprising to see the Z Flip 6 receive a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> discount. However, at $300 off, it's even cheaper than the new "affordable" Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which starts at $899. This makes the Galaxy Z Flip 6 an even better deal right now, especially as Samsung is likely trying to clear out stock in favor of its latest phones (many colors are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip6/buy/galaxy-z-flip6-256gb-unlocked-sm-f741uzyaxaa/">out of stock at Samsung.com</a>).</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primeday" target="_blank"><strong>Shop all Amazon Prime Day deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4a019165-f1ea-4174-8b28-b4c561b358cf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="A $300 discount on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is no joke, and we've seen devices sell out during Prime Day, so you should act quickly before they're gone!

That said, if you'd rather not spend more than $1000 on a new phone, there are plenty of reasons why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> is still worth buying.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 is a well-designed phone with impressive durability for a foldable. It also boasts some impressive specs, including a bright display and a powerful Snapdragon chipset. In fact, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 chip</a> appears to be on par with the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 powering the Z Flip 6, at least in CPU power.</p><p>And while the Galaxy Z Flip 6 doesn't have the fastest charging speeds, it matches and exceeds those of the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sporting 25W wired and 15W wireless. By contrast, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 drops wireless charging speed to 10W, meaning it will likely take longer to charge its larger battery.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 also supports plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features and will likely receive more features with future updates. After all, Samsung promises 7 years of OS upgrades (with six more to go) for the Z Flip 6, so you don't have to worry about missing out very much if you pick one up now.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-42">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

It seems this software is another Samsung alternative to Android Auto. As the publication notes, the Korean OEM already provides "Samsung Auto" on its Galaxy phones sold in China. The tipster showed off an alleged look at its UI, which seems to feature whatever app you're using in an off-center area.</p><p>The top right features a tile that says "Good Evening, listen to the brief for..." It reminds us of Samsung's Now Brief feature in One UI 7 (and 8) for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">recent foldables</a>. Beneath that, with a music note, is a default music app that drivers can take advantage of. This alleged design also sports a navigation bar similar to Galaxy phones and two app bars.</p><p>The tipster claims Samsung's "Auto Dex" will support "8500+ car models of 120+ brands." Additionally, there's a chance users can activate this on their phone. Perhaps that speculation holds merit, considering this rumored look features One UI's navigational icons.</p><h2 id="samsung-continues-with-its-own-take-2">Samsung continues with its own take</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here's a FIRST LOOK at Samsung's 'Auto DeX', supporting 8500+ car models of 120+ brands. The great news is, even if your car doesn't support it or you don't have a car, you can use it with some tricks. Another great news is, you can use DeX even if your phone doesn't support it! pic.twitter.com/bQ2WOCKgEr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1942661417397805178">July 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>There's still a lot of uncertainty behind this feature, so take this with a grain of salt for now. In response <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942784264463938043">to a comment</a>, the tipster claims "Auto Dex" has not entered internal testing, but rather this is simply "a very early implementation of DeX on Samsung Auto."</p><p>The folks at 9to5 and their long memory brought up Google's old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-phone-screens-discontinued">Android Auto for phone screens</a>, which was discontinued back in 2022. Essentially, users could have everything Android Auto offered, but in a small package: their phone. This rumored "Auto Dex" from Samsung seems to have been created in a similar vein. There seems to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GalaxyTechie/status/1942272781061874011">a slim chance</a> that users outside of China will also get this feature, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>As far as Android Auto is concerned, for the rest of us, a recent rumor suggests Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-smart-glasses-integration-code-rumors">working on integrating smart glasses</a>. Those hopes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-update-smart-glasses-mention-dashed">were quickly dashed</a> after an update for Android Auto removed all mentions of "glasses" within its code. There's speculation that there could've been a translation error, considering that the rumor originated from an overseas discovery.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that Samsung was also spotted working on its own version of Android's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-android-earthquake-alerts-user-emergency-control">earthquake alerts</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But those aren't always easy to tote around with you, especially if you don't carry a large bag around at all times. That's where the Onyx Boox Palma 2 comes in, a phone-sized e-reader that's currently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81"><strong>10% off</strong></a> for Prime Day.</p><p>While 10% isn't the biggest discount we've seen during Amazon's 4-day event, Onyx doesn't regularly discount the Boox Palma or Palma 2, so it's a rare deal. If you don't believe me, check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0DTTV6M81">Camelcamelcamel page</a> and look at the <em>very</em> flat price graph over the past few months.</p><p>The first time I got the original Palma at the end of 2023, my wife immediately laid claim to it when I was done writing the review. Once the second one came out, the upgrade was a no-brainer, especially given how often she uses it. That thing goes with her everywhere!</p><p>For the cost of a budget-priced phone, you'll be getting a cutting-edge Android-powered e-reader with a gorgeous black & white Carta E Ink display. It's got a fast refresh rate that feels more like a normal screen than an old Kindle, but the eye-friendly nature of E Ink and its ultra comfortable display that's easy to see in any light.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf" name="onyx-boox-palma-2-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qPf7RC9nxBcva3iUT6gRGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Onyx Boox Palma 2 üìñ</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$299.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank"><strong>$269.99 at Amazon</strong></a><em></em></p><p>"Unlike a Kindle, you can get your books, apps, or whatever you want from anywhere you want on the Palma 2. It's got the Google Play Store preinstalled, but any Android app can be installed here, opening up the number of reading resources by several magnitudes.

This might be the size of a phone, but you can't stick a SIM card in it. It's also only a black & white display, so no fancy color E Ink here.</p><p><strong>Price check üíµ: </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/p/boox-6-13-palma2/-/A-1001353904">$299 at Target</a> |<strong> </strong><a href="https://shop.boox.com/products/palma2">$299 at Onyx</a></p><p><strong>Alternative deal ü™ô: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bigme-Smartphone-Hibreak-Android-36-Level/dp/B0FF4FWQFP"><strong>Bigme Hibreak Pro E Ink phone - </strong><del>$459</del><strong> $436.05 at Amazon</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/BOOX-Mobile-Fingerprint-Recognition-Microphones/dp/B0DTTV6M81" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="98acb03b-cccb-4f27-b1e8-a4b943e16fd9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $299.99" data-dimension48="Was: $299.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p>The Onyx Boox Palma 2 is an upgrade over the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/onyx-boox-palma-review">Boox Palma</a> in subtle ways, but that doesn't mean it's not nicer to use. One of the best new features is the fingerprint scanner built into the side-mounted power button, something the original release didn't have. That means you can have the same level of biometric security on your e-reader as you do on your phone!</p><p>It's also got a newer, faster chipset inside and comes installed with Android 13, whereas the original release only features Android 11. The OS version doesn't usually matter much on these types of devices since security updates are often delivered through the Google Play backend, but apps eventually stop supporting older versions of Android, so having something newer is always preferable.</p><p>Aside from the diminutive size that you'll love, this display is something you need to see in action, especially if you're coming from an older e-reader like a Kindle. Gone are the days when the whole screen would have to flash just to change the page. This one refreshes more like a normal phone display and can even play back videos and games so long as you don't mind that it's only black & white.</p><p>Plus, since it's E Ink, it's actually <em>easier</em> to read in the sun than inside, the polar opposite of most phones. That, plus the eye-friendly nature of E Ink displays and a backlight that's totally flicker-free, ensures that you can read for hours on end without worrying about eye strain. It's a win-win!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

What's interesting about this listing is that it appears Samsung has prepared its S25 FE with wireless charging capabilities. The WPC states the device has received Qi2 (v2.1.0) certification. Another standout for this listing is a surprising real-life image of the S25 FE.</p><p>We've heard rumors about the S25 FE sticking close to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the flagship S25 series'</a> design, which is typically the trend.</p><p>The WPC's real-life image showed the phone's display and back. It's hard to see, but it doesn't seem like the S25 FE will sport thick bezels. They seem relatively thin. The photo also shows its centered punch-hole selfie camera. The look at its rear panel shows off the phone in a black option, perhaps fancied up as "Black Shadow" or something like that.</p><p>Samsung's name (logo) is centered at the bottom, but its triple rear camera array is another talking point. It seems the S25 FE will shy away from its flagship family in one way, by removing the thick, black lens rings. Instead, the WPC's image suggests the phone will have shiny silvery rings for its camera lenses. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">new Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has the same change, so perhaps this is to be expected.</p><h2 id="the-next-fe-2">The Next FE</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:615px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:97.56%;"><img id="L88f8MpTKHDcbtmjh7xm2Q" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing" alt="The World Power Consortium's Qi2 certification listing for the Galaxy S25 FE shows its real-life look, with silver rings around its cameras and relatively thin display bezels." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L88f8MpTKHDcbtmjh7xm2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="615" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: World Power Consortium)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're still in the dark about an important charging spec: its strength. It's nice that the WPC's listing highlights Qi2 support for the Galaxy S25 FE, but the flagship series also has this‚Äî<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">and in a weird way, at that</a>. While the entire flagship series features Qi2 wireless charging at 15W, the phones don't natively have magnets inside. This means consumers will need a case with those magnets available.</p><p>The publication speculates Samsung might go down a similar route with the S25 FE, too. It just remains to be seen if the charging wattage remains the same.</p><p>We got our first alleged look at the S25 FE <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-leak-shows-a-design-youve-definitely-seen-before">through a rendering leak</a> in mid-June. One thing rumored was that this phone is thinner than the S24 FE. Rumors claim the S25 FE measures 7.4mm. It's not something insane, but consumers might notice it when holding it. The phone is also supposedly on the way with a 6.7-inch display, which might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-display-could-get-a-flagship-grade-treatment">get a flagship-level upgrade</a>.</p><p>A more recent rumor claims the device's screen could be more flexible, as Samsung might drop the more rigid OLED tech. This is reportedly the catalyst behind the thinner S25 FE build.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-selfie-camera-upgrade-rumored">rumors about its cameras</a> suggest its selfie camera could jump to 12MP. Speculation is still unclear about its main set of lenses, but the previous generation offered a 50MP primary, a 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

But while many people complained about its high price, you won't have to deal with that huge negative point since the Pixel Fold is now on sale for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone"><strong>$1,220 off</strong></a> during Woot's own Prime Day event.</p><p>That brings the original $1,799 price down to <strong>just $579.99</strong> for 256GB model. I certainly expected to see the Pixel Fold drop in price by this time, but that kind of discount is usually reserved for some broken, second-hand model. This one is brand new, but it's a fairly limited stock, so if you're interested, you should grab it ASAP!</p><p>The two reasons I loved the Pixel Fold at launch were for its unique form factor and its cameras. No other book-style foldable has the unique passport-like aspect ratio of the Pixel Fold, and few foldables to this day can match the versatility of the triple camera system on the back, including a fantastic 5x optical zoom periscope camera.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day deals and FAQ</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f7943aee-3450-47f7-880b-f37308360ff7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension25="$" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.08%;"><img id="NYxUxhRnsEyV7LUNmA6g2J" name="Google-Pixel-Fold-render-official-obsidian-all-angles.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NYxUxhRnsEyV7LUNmA6g2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1763" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel Fold üì©üì≤</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank" data-dimension112="f7943aee-3450-47f7-880b-f37308360ff7" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension48="Was: $1,799.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$1,799.99</del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-google-pixel-fold-5g-smartphone" target="_blank"><strong>$579.99 at Woot!</strong></a></p><p><em>Woot is an Amazon company, so Prime members get free shipping!</em></p><p>"After years of speculation and anticipation, Google actually made its own foldable Pixel phone.

It's shorter and wider than any other book-style foldable, making it easy to use the outer screen whenever you feel like using something smaller. When it's unfolded, this wider aspect ratio makes apps default to tablet view, something book-style foldables should have done <em>ages</em> ago. Google switched to a taller, narrower design on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and I hate it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aZmjh6UgqPZgH9yhKAG6jY" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-fold-multitasking.jpg" alt="Multitasking on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZmjh6UgqPZgH9yhKAG6jY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My colleague, Andrew Myrick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/my-week-with-the-google-pixel-fold">published a second opinion piece</a> a few months after my original Pixel Fold review. He had more issues with battery life than I did and found the brightness of the inner screen a bit lacking. In other words, your experience with this phone may vary quite a bit depending on your usage.</p><p>But we both agreed that the cameras were superb and the aspect ratio was golden.

A smart decision to prevent this is to buy a decent stockpile ahead of time.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day is the best time of the year to stock up on batteries. Buying in bulk is smart as it reduces the unit price, but you can really leverage the economies of scale by buying in bulk during awesome sales like Prime Day or Black Friday.</p><p>Be sure to check out what sort of batteries your remotes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers">Bluetooth trackers</a>, smart home accessories, and other gadgets use.

You don't want them going bad from disuse, rotting away in your pantry or store room.</p><p>After shelf life longevity, the next best thing to do is to invest in battery sizes you know you use frequently. There's no point in hoarding D or C cells when nothing in your home uses them. On the other hand, AAA batteries and CR2032 batteries are used in nearly everything that's battery-operated these days. Check your home equipment and gear before placing your order.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

This year gave us an ultra-thin Galaxy Z Fold 7, a much bigger Galaxy Z Flip 7, and three new smartwatches. And that's not all, on the software front, these devices come packed with the latest One UI 8, backed by Android 16. This means new Galaxy AI features debut on these devices along with Wear OS 6 quirks!

To begin, it sheds its usual folder-like camera bar for the largest ever edge-to-edge cover screen on a Galaxy Z Flip series.</p><p>It's a no-brainer that the 4.1-inch Super AMOLED FlexWindow will allow users to do more when right from its cover screen when the device is flipped shut. The Flip 7 gets a larger 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen and a 120 Hz refresh rate. Both the internal and external displays are protected by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>As for its cameras, the Z Flip 7 gets a 50 MP wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens, along with a 10 MP selfie shooter.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iCiJNJyhNsZubA23MoZGA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This time around, even with its foldables, Samsung wanted to take the word "slim" to the next level. With the Galaxy Z Flip 7, the Korean OEM promises a "pocket-sized AI-powerhouse." Measuring a compact 13.7mm when folded, the clamshell weighs only 188 grams. Aiding it to stay thin is Samsung's updated hinge mechanism, the Armor FlexHinge. The Korean OEM seems to be proving that powerful things can also come in small packages.</p><p>As sleek as it is, under the hood, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is powered by Samsung's recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a>, which will help run all the new Galaxy AI features that come with One UI 8 out of the box. These features include the new Now Bar and Now Brief, as seen in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series. </a>Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">Gemini Live</a> swoops in on the cover display, bringing useful hands-free assistance for a range of topics.</p><p>This pocket-sized dynamite of a phone comes with a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge." The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available in two storage configurations: 12/256GB and 12/512GB, and in three colorways: Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red. The Mint is reserved for online purchases only. Preorders begin today, and it is set to hit stores on July 25, starting at $1,099.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is flexing hard with its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> as it arrives as the thinnest and almost creaseless foldable yet.

The Z Fold 7 arrives with a much wider 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x cover display that Samsung says has, 21:9 aspect ratio.

Choosing a phone color is relatively easier, but some might be stumped by this step as well. The simplest way to make a choice you won't regret is to get something that's your favorite color. And if you don't have a favorite, just go for the black option. There's a reason why black is a staple in fashion; it's a no-brainer whether you're buying clothes, shoes, phones, or smartwatches.</p><p>Our number one recommendation from this year's assortment is the Blue Shadow version of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. This deep blue has a mesmerising quality to it, almost resembling the deep, calm waters of the ocean at night or a classic pair of dark blue jeans. The shape of the Z Fold 7 looks rather striking in this coat of paint.</p><p>Fans of lighter hues should stick to the Silver Shadow option. There's no white variant of the Fold 7 this time around, but the silver color is a fitting replacement to appease those who delight in lighter shades.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's still something to please everyone on the roster. Retaining the Jet Black colorway was the smartest move on Samsung's part since it's a basic shade that is a safe choice for most people.</p><p>Those who prefer a bolder, spicier paint job will be pleased with the Coral Red hue that we saw on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>. It's very reminiscent of the hot chilli red <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-9-review">ASUS Zenfone 9</a> variant that went over massively well with the crowds a few years ago. I will never get over that shade, which is why it brings me boundless joy to see a similar color on the Galaxy S25 and now the Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p><p>If you're not too bold but also tired of a plain black phone, Blue Shadow provides a healthy balance of both. It's not a plain Jane blue hue; the steely dark blue compliments the sleek profile of the Flip 7. Darker colors don't get dirty as easily as lighter colors and small scratches are less noticeable too, so you still retain the benefits of a darker shade like Jet Black.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Depending on what finish and drop protection levels you're after, picking the best Galaxy Z Flip 7 case is straightforward business. I don't recommend using your $1,500 phone without a case, especially since repairs on a foldable phone cost a fortune.</p><p>Regardless, my top choice will always be the ultra-thin Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 600D Aramid Fiber Case. At 0.04 inches, it's mind-blowing just how slim and lightweight the Thinborne case truly is. The hefty price tag justifies itself several times over when you consider the quality and set of features you get. There's a tempered glass screen protector for the cover display included with the case. It's hard to believe the case also supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe and Qi2 accessories</a>.</p><p>Money might be an object of concern, in which case I have several cheaper recommendations that don't compromise quality. Spigen should be your go-to brand when looking for high-quality products on a tighter budget. The new Airfit Pro MagFit is highly robust, boasting military-grade drop-proofing, but it weighs next to nothing and hardly adds any bulk at all. Admittedly, the hinge is thick, but this is to defend the weakest link of the Flip 7.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That means you have about two weeks to take advantage of preorder deals before they're gone.</p><h2 id="what-are-the-specs-of-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-2">What are the specs of the Galaxy Z Flip 7?</h2><p>Similar to past Z Flip phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is a clamshell device with two displays and a sturdy folding hinge. That's pretty much where the similarities end, as Samsung has packed the new generation with an upgraded, edge-to-edge cover display, some new hardware, and the lightest, thinnest frame of any Flip series phone to date. The battery is also larger than ever, plus you get all of the latest Galaxy AI software features with seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-33" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FMDCXKz2GJ2bYHLk7G2s96.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="should-i-buy-the-galaxy-z-flip-7-or-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-2">Should I buy the Galaxy Z Flip 7 or Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE?</h2><p>Although we haven't been able to study the two phones side by side just yet, it's most likely going to depend on your budget and what you're looking for in a foldable phone. With a starting price of $899.99, the FE is a bit more affordable than the standard Z Flip 7, but the trade-off is a weaker processor and less battery life. Whether or not that's a dealbreaker is up to you, but I'd start by seeing how much you can save using one of the preorder deals above. Who knows, maybe the right deal could make this question completely moot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While it's become more of an accessory than ever before, that doesn't mean I'm not intrigued when new alternatives arrive. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> series managed to pique my interest at just the right time.</p><h2 id="a-new-but-familiar-design-2">A new, but familiar, design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="c8kF5dHXPFVajM3PdGPBTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-23" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, 8 Classic, and Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c8kF5dHXPFVajM3PdGPBTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious change here is that the squircle-like design introduced with the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is now found across all smartwatch models. So those hoping that Samsung would keep at least one traditional design around aren't going to be too happy.</p><p>That being said, I also wasn't a fan of the Watch Ultra's design at first, but after buying one and using it for a while, it grew on me. I'm not saying that will be the same experience for you, but I recommend giving it a shot before immediately dismissing it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="42No4oG3cJTS32UpTAMkWE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-folded-watch-8-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 folded next to Watch 8 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42No4oG3cJTS32UpTAMkWE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This new design also brings about a couple of other major changes to the Watch 8 and 8 Classic, such as a slimmer and lighter design. Samsung says the Watch 8 is 11% thinner than the Watch 7, making it the "thinnest Galaxy Watch." And when I held the Watch 8 for the first time, even with the band attached, I couldn't believe how light it was.</p><p>Even the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, with its larger frame and extra hardware, felt a lot lighter than I expected. Seeing as I'm someone who prefers larger wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch/mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-review">TicWatch Atlas</a> or Galaxy Watch Ultra, I'm used to hefty chunks of aluminum and glass. The Watch 8 Classic didn't give me the same feeling, but it did feel like a watch that I could wear every day and occasionally forget it was there.</p><h2 id="the-rotating-crown-returns-2">The rotating crown returns</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PUZbnawgyRTkdAxkcStpQG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-16" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PUZbnawgyRTkdAxkcStpQG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of the extra hardware, the rotating crown has returned to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, and I couldn't be more excited. This is my favorite way of interacting with a smartwatch, and Samsung has essentially perfected the entire experience. As a side note, it turns out that the "tick-tock" nature of the crown is intentional, meaning that if the Watch 9 Classic rolls out next year, it likely won't have one.</p><p>There is one more design change, and it's not one that's specific to the Watch 8 Classic. Samsung has redesigned its band mechanism with the Watch 8 series, which came as a surprise to me. I actually liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">previous mechanism</a> with the push button to retract the springs when swapping out bands.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ttcZtLRF2gmExaf6sfF3TG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-31" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch band connector comparison hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ttcZtLRF2gmExaf6sfF3TG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="anwLLKoLFE6u7HZtCx2jUG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-27" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch band connector comparison hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/anwLLKoLFE6u7HZtCx2jUG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uCcL7iunwDUR2hQiL4LzRG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-13" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Bands hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCcL7iunwDUR2hQiL4LzRG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>However, there's now a "tongue" in the middle that inserts into the watch casing.

Such a design leads us to the "cushion" design that Samsung brought with the Ultra, where the circular watch face sits atop a square-ish base. Kicking things off is the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which Samsung states brings "timeliness sophistication" with modern features.</p><p>The 8 Classic hits the market in one size, 46mm (1.34-inch display), and is available in black and white options for ~$500. However, it sports a "slimmer, brighter Classic screen." The post states the Watch 8 Classic's display should make consumers' viewing experience much better, meaning apps and things on it are easier to see. Additionally, the continuation of the rotating bezel makes scrolling (or twisting) through your apps a breeze.</p><p>Samsung also highlights a new "Quick Button" for "added convenience." The Watch 8 Classic sports a 445mAh battery, 2GB of memory, and 64GB of storage.</p><h2 id="motivation-for-health-2">Motivation for Health</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8hbaav4VVL6HDRJSzKNXBL" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-1" alt="Galaxy Watch 8 Classic White" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hbaav4VVL6HDRJSzKNXBL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5333" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In celebration of the launch, Samsung's TM Roh, president and acting head of the device experience division, said, "By combining purposeful design with advanced sensor technology and an intuitive AI-powered experience, the Galaxy Watch 8 series serves as a starting point for a healthier, more connected life, making it easier than ever to take meaningful steps toward users‚Äô well-being."</p><p>The first major feature is a new one, as Samsung details the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's "Antioxidant Index." For the first time, the company says users can measure their carotenoid levels "in just five seconds" to make more informed choices for a better lifestyle and healthier aging.</p><p>Samsung is pushing the sleep monitoring experience of its Galaxy Watch 8 series, stating users will find "tailored" sleep coaching tools, severe sleep apnea detection, and the ability to create an ideal sleep environment, so you're not tired the next day.</p><p>More than that, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic introduces several "unique" health-focused features, like Bedtime Guidance. Samsung says this feature will "measure your circadian rhythm" to help you identify the best time to sleep. Additionally, the Watch 8 Classic brings "Vascular Load," which is designed to help users understand their stress levels on their vascular system during the night.</p><p>High Stress alerts and a Mindfulness tracker help users record their mood and manage their stress throughout the day, and there is also a selection of breathing exercises, too. Runners will find a Running Coach and an updated "Together" function, which lets users bring their friends in for a game-like journey into fitness. Energy Score is backed by Samsung's AI, giving users a combined look into their daily energy.</p><h2 id="samsung-wear-os-and-gemini-2">Samsung, Wear OS, and Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-15" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYpvMH6qr3aCU7PUmPoTSG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In tandem with Google, Samsung is bringing Gemini to its Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>. The post highlights the ability to go hands-free, thanks to Gemini. Users can ask the AI to locate a nearby cafe or to text/call someone on their contact list. The Samsung Health app, much like Calendar, Reminder, and the Clock app, is also available to utilize hands-free with Gemini.</p><p>Samsung's own One UI 8 Watch is also rolling out to the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. The company states the OS has been refined to fit the device's screen, bringing Multi-Info tiles and a watch variant of the Now Bar, prominently featured on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-2">The Galaxy Watch 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Watch 8 model has been granted its thinnest build yet. Samsung says consumers will find the watch is roughly 11% thinner than its previous iterations. The company also implemented its new "Dynamic Lug" system, which helps the watch move with your wrist to increase its comfort levels and improve its overall fit when worn.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 is launching in two sizes: 40mm and 44mm. The post states users will find a 1.34-inch and a 1.47-inch Super AMOLED display, respectively, for these two sizes. Samsung highlights the Watch 8's 50% increase in brightness capabilities with a measurement of 3,000nits.</p><p>Design-wise, like the Watch 8 Classic, the base Watch 8 sports a cushion design, inspired by the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p><p>Consumers interested in the Galaxy Watch 8 will find the same host of sleep and health/fitness features previously mentioned for the Watch 8 Classic. This includes the assistance of Google's AI, Gemini, and One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6). Internally, both devices sport the Exynos W1000 SoC. Samsung states its entry-level Watch 8 receives a 325mAh battery (40mm) and a 435mAh battery (44mm).</p><p>The Watch 8 starts at ~$360 (40mm) and ~$400 (44mm) for its Bluetooth version.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung highlights its 2025 Galaxy Watch Ultra model, which it touts as its "most advanced and durable" version. The watch features an IP68 rating for water resistance and a strong MIL-STD-810H durability rating for bumps and hard knocks. Samsung has also upgraded its 2025 variant with 64GB of storage paired with 2GB of memory.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra's battery life receives some TLC, as Samsung boosts it with enough power for "100 hours" of use. Many of the other features in the Galaxy Watch 8 series, such as Samsung Health, Gemini, multi-info tiles, and more, are present on the Watch Ultra.</p><p>Users can find this device starting at $649 (47mm) in an all-new Titanium Blue, alongside Titanium Gray and Titanium Silver.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Existentialism aside, the same is true with various companies and the devices they sell. That's exactly where Samsung ended up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, as its flagship foldable suite of phones has grown fairly stale over the three previous generations.</p><p>With the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung finally traded in the hand-me-down robes for a brand new set of its own. And after being able to spend some time with it, I've come away feeling less confused than I did before.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is basically everything that I and others have been asking for. A thinner design with better performance and, more importantly, a camera system worthy of the phone's price tag. Although my initial time was limited, I feel fairly certain that Samsung has responded to those requests in a huge way.</p><h2 id="bigger-and-lighter-2">Bigger and lighter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-28" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EvV6Hw4NQswxXZ9hq6Mgr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fold 7 feels even more like a "do-it-all" device than before, thanks to the displays. The cover screen is wider, making it much more comfortable to use.

The Flip 7 debuts with a larger 4.1-inch Super AMOLED display over its predecessor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">the Flip 6</a> (and other iterations). Samsung highlights the display's edge-to-edge appeal, which throws out that old folder tab-like design, giving consumers a maximum amount of space to do whatever they need to.</p><p>Inside, the Flip 7 rocks a 6.9-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X screen, that's said to be "smooth and immersive." Building upon that is the phone's 120Hz refresh rate on its internal and external screens. Another notable design change is the Flip 7's slimmer 13.7mm build. Additionally, its "cover and back" are shielded by Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><p>Helping the Flip 7 stay thinner this go round is Samsung's updated hinge mechanism, the Armor FlexHinge.</p><p>Interest in the Flip 7's cameras leads Samsung to detail its dual array, consisting of a 50MP Wide and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. The company says these "flagship quality" lenses should bring that level of clarity to every shot. Additionally, Samsung encourages users to check out its Nightography setting. Through this, the post states users can capture "vivid photos in low light."</p><p>Teased as a "pocket-sized selfie studio," the Flip 7 brings editing tools via Portrait Studio in Photo Assist. Moreover, you'll also have the ProVisual Engine there to back you up after every photo, optimizing them for clarity and bold colors. The selfie lens debuts at 10MP on the phone.</p><h2 id="the-flip-7-stands-tall-in-a-small-package-2">The Flip 7 stands tall (in a small package)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="v44XM8Y6Pt3BB6FNFco756" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-11" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v44XM8Y6Pt3BB6FNFco756.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, future Galaxy Z Flip 7 owners will find Samsung's recently revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500 SoC</a>.</p><p>This chip will have a lot of work to do, as Samsung highlights loads of AI software inside its newest clamshell phone. As you'd expect, courtesy of One UI 8, the Flip 7 features the new Now Bar and Now Brief, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">the Galaxy S25 series</a>. The Now Bar displays app activity in real-time, as well as boasting new third-party app support for users. Via the Flip 7's cover screen, the Now Bar can even display rideshare ETA and more.</p><p>For the Now Brief, users will find these personalized daily updates for traffic, reminders, and more. The Now Brief can also recommend videos and music based on your personal preference and available subscriptions.</p><p>Also, new in One UI 8's software, the Flip 7's cover display clock can "adapt and stretch" to your chosen background. The numbers can adhere to the contours of your photo, so it's never in the way, ensuring you can see both the time and your favorite photo whenever.</p><p>Potential Flip 7 users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">will have access to Gemini Live</a> on their cover display, bringing useful hands-free assistance for a range of topics. Samsung also tossed in camera support for the Flip 7 in Gemini Live, so the AI can offer insights into your next outfit, yoga poses, and much more.</p><p>Getting you and your Flip 7 through the day will be a 4,300mAh battery, delivering "up to 31 hours of video on a single charge." Consumers will also find the following RAM/storage config: 12/256GB and 12/512GB. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 is available for pre-order today (July 9) for $1,099 in Blue Shadow, Jet Black, and Coral Red‚ÄîMint is available online only.

Unlike its flagship counterpart, the Flip 7 FE continues the folder tab-like cutout design over its external display's cameras, like the Flip 6. However, it matches the flagship Flip 7 with a 50MP and 12MP dual array.</p><p>Opening it up, consumers will find a slightly smaller 6.7-inch internal and 3.4-inch cover display. Included inside the device is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">older Exynos 2400 SoC</a> from Samsung.

Samsung's president and acting head of the device experience, TM Roh, commented about the device, saying, "Galaxy Z Fold7 combines Galaxy AI with powerful hardware to deliver our most advanced smartphone experience yet." As such, the Fold 7 features massive improvements to its build, as it slims down to 8.9mm when folded (4.2mm unfolded).</p><p>Quick glances at your Fold 7 will be done on its 6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x display. However, Samsung states users will notice one major difference: the cover display is wider. The company delivers a 21:9 aspect ratio on the Fold 7's cover screen. Opening it up, you'll find a colorful 8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x screen with up to 2,600nits of peak brightness.</p><p>Speaking volumes to its increased power levels is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>. Not only has the Fold 7 been powered up across the board, but Samsung states this chip will further fuel its AI efforts.</p><p>With a triple camera array, the Fold 7 provides access to the Galaxy Z series' first 200MP (wide-angle) primary lens. Complimenting this is a 12MP ultra-wide and a 10MP telephoto lens. The cover display rocks a 10MP lens, the same as its internal display.</p><h2 id="cameras-beyond-2">Cameras & Beyond</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the Flip 7 series, the Fold 7 features Samsung's ProVisual Engine for photo optimization. On the side, users will find Night Video, capable of "separating moving subjects from still backgrounds to reduce noise." There's also 10-bit HDR support on the book-style foldable, enhancing the color depth in your captured memories.</p><p>Photo Assist brings AI-powered adjustments for your photos, in case something is out of place or in the way. Generative Edit and Audio Eraser come in as useful additions for Fold 7 users to quickly remove blemishes or sounds that would otherwise ruin a perfect shot/video. More importantly, Samsung says Fold 7 users can utilize side-by-side editing and Show Original to compare the first photo to your edits conveniently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-10" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Google Gemini hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCRgAQhcjbG28XCcx6NSw3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung furthers its AI presence on the Fold 7 through One UI 8 (Android 16), which is already on the device. One UI 8 is said to "combine" Samsung's intelligent models and its large-screen multitasking tools on the Fold 7, making a cohesive unit. Galaxy AI on this larger screen device adds "AI Results view," which lets users do what they need to while viewing what the AI has returned about their query.</p><p>Drawing Assist, Writing Assist, and Drag & Drop bring extra uses for convenience throughout the day when multitasking with the Galaxy Z Fold 7. It's worth noting Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-more-in-store-android-samsung-unpacked">major AI announcement for Android</a>, which brings Circle to Search updates and an improved Gemini Live experience.</p><p>The Fold 7 features a 4,400mAh battery setup. Internally, the foldable features the following RAM/storage config: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/1TB.

In the week leading up to Unpacked and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> unveiling, I spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 6, so I wasn't coming into it with no reference point.</p><p>After going hands-on with the Flip 7, my immediate impressions were surprisingly more positive than I expected. Despite only using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-year-later">Flip 6</a> for about a week, the Flip 7 seems like a massive upgrade.</p><h2 id="it-s-all-about-the-flexwindow-2">It's all about the FlexWindow</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-selfies-hands-on-2" alt="Selfie camera using cover screen on Galaxy Z Flip 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rUsKKPFxvJ7nnKUJfrfz4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious reason why I feel this way has to do with the FlexWindow, which is getting supercharged. The screen itself is much larger, as it now wraps around the dual cameras that are still found in the bottom right corner, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a>. We also have a bunch of new AI features, with the most notable being the ability to access Gemini and Gemini Live without opening the phone.</p><p>Not only that, but like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung is bringing the Now Bar and Now Brief features from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to the Flip 7 with One UI 8. And there's even a Now Brief button that appears in the opposite corner of the dual cameras. Samsung also explained that while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> works with Google and Samsung apps, it's working with partners to bring even more apps into the mix.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="3rMQU8KgQ43uU5kF4B7B56" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Now Brief hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3rMQU8KgQ43uU5kF4B7B56.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="aNhV6pGS28zbYjMd8Xbo76" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aNhV6pGS28zbYjMd8Xbo76.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Google Gemini Cover Screen hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/obbkK4e4hbDGaVLsLB8366.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Customization is just another layer that Samsung is improving, with things like auto-curated wallpapers. And if you're tired of the clock widget hiding the face of a loved one on the FlexWindow, it's been updated to adapt and fit around the subject. I can't really help but feel like Samsung took a page from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/everything-apple-stole-from-android-and-wear-os-at-wwdc-2025">Apple and iOS 26</a>, but it's still a welcome addition.</p><p>The last thing that I want to mention about the FlexWindow isn't all that great. Samsung spent a lot of time talking about all of the functionality being added, which is wonderful, but you still can't use any app without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">Good Lock and MultiStar</a>.</p><p>I'm genuinely curious and confused as to why Samsung didn't make this one of the defining features of the Flip 7. It would've been the best time to do so, given the expanded cover screen. And while the other new features are more than welcome, it just feels like a missed opportunity.</p><h2 id="exynos-replaces-snapdragon-2">Exynos replaces Snapdragon</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 home screen main display hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DuJAb8juw4oqbdoMCin956.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the FlexWindow isn't the only attraction of the Flip 7, as the main display has also been improved.

Normally, smaller phones would get second-rate specs because manufacturers couldn't fit all the big-boy cameras or most powerful processors into a smaller package, but that wasn't the case with the Pixel 9 Pro. It had everything the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL did, all at a better price and a pocket-friendly size.</p><p>While we expect Google to announce the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">Pixel 10 series</a> sometime in the next month or so, all the rumors point to the Pixel 10 Pro selling for at least $1,000 when it debuts.

Manufacturers accelerated their launch schedules, and it feels like the year has been a never-ending cycle of phone launches. That's good news if you're looking to upgrade your phone, with plenty of great options available.</p><p>I used well over 40 phones until now in 2025, including all the major Android releases in the budget, mid-range, and flagship segments. My go-to recommendation is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>; OnePlus did a fantastic job with the phone, and it has flagship-level cameras, a bright AMOLED panel, and outstanding battery life. The best part is that it's down to $499 on Amazon and Best Buy right now, a $100 discount from its usual retail price.</p><p>If you need clean software and the best AI software utilities, then the Pixel 9a is what I'd suggest in the mid-range category. It has a modest discount, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Gemini-Smartphone-Incredible/dp/B0DVHV7X53">bringing it down to $423 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-9a-128gb-unlocked-obsidian/6612957.p?skuId=6612957">Best Buy</a>. You get great cameras, a vibrant OLED panel, Google's best software features, and Android 16.</p><p>If you're ready to switch to Google's best cameras, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is what I'd recommend; it is my favorite Pixel right now, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-XL-Smartphone/dp/B0D7HV78PT">coming in at $749 on Amazon</a>, you're getting a huge $350 discount. This deal is close to selling out, so if you've decided on the phone, I'd suggest getting it as soon as possible. And if you're interested in accessories, head on over to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-in-3938581496061802642-20">all deals live now</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0526a664-9ba2-48fa-8a2b-83aff5b98192" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $599" data-dimension48="Was: $599" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe" name="oneplus 13r reco 500x500" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V24Sd4Fy7iR5gE2SmVAhCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>OnePlus 13R üì±</strong></p><p><strong>Was: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/" data-dimension112="0526a664-9ba2-48fa-8a2b-83aff5b98192" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Was: $599" data-dimension48="Was: $599" data-dimension25=""><del><strong>$599</strong></del></a></p><p><strong>Now:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/"><strong>$499 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><strong>Other retailers üíµ: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p?skuId=6609358"><strong>$499 at Best Buy </strong></a><strong>|</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oneplus-13r-256gb-unlocked-nebula-noir/6609358.p?skuId=6609358"><strong> </strong></a><a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/oneplus-13r?sku=5011111059"><strong>$529 at OnePlus</strong></a></p><p><strong>Android Central review ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</strong>1/2</p><p>I called the OnePlus 13R the definitive value flagship in my review.

It delivers the best performance, has the best battery life, and a vibrant AMOLED panel with good software customizability.</p><p>I don't like the new iterations of OxygenOS as much as the legacy builds, but I'll admit the software has good fluidity, and it looks modern. And with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Smartphone-Snapdragon-SUPERVOOC-Hasselblad/dp/B0DP96J3KT/">phone down to $499</a>, you're getting a terrific value. It outshines all other phones in the $500 to $700 segment, and if you need a reliable phone that looks good and holds up incredibly well in daily use, you should just get the OnePlus 13R.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our¬†</strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

There are two USB-A and one standard USB-C ports, as well as a second Type-C port where the retractable cable resides.</p><p>The retractable cable gets 68cm or 2.2ft long and is made of highly durable nylon braided material. Its flat linguini-like shape prevents tangles and snags. As an added bonus, cats and dogs find it hard to nibble and break nylon braided cables such as this one.</p><p>I found the plug locks to be sturdy, and they stay put when set. Some travel adapter prongs tend to have loose springs, but clearly Baseus made sure the quality was up to par with this adapter. Like most of the brand's charging gear, the EnerCore CG11 is well-made and sure to last a long time.</p><p><em><strong>For everything to do with Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The switch to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 unlocks much better performance, and you get 256GB UFS 4.0 storage on the base model.

The panel now has a 2K resolution (2780 x 1264) with 120Hz refresh, and it gets bright ‚Äî I didn't have any issues using it outdoors under intense heat.</p><p>The Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset ensures the phone handles anything you throw at it; there wasn't any issue with overheating even while playing demanding games, and I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use. The cameras are just as good as the OnePlus 13, and while you miss out on some versatility, you get terrific photos and videos.</p><p>Thanks to the 6,000mAh battery, the phone lasts up to two days between charges. And it has 55W charging, with the battery taking less than an hour to charge ‚Äî that's less time than the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>OnePlus did a better job with the software as well, and while there's still overt customization, it looks modern, and you get plenty of useful features.

The bezels are relatively thin, it's easy to transfer photos to the device, and it has built-in storage.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You need smart assistant integration.</p><p>The Pexar is straightforward to set up and use; it uses the Frameo platform, and you can easily connect it to your phone to transfer photos. The free plan is limited to sending 15 photos at once, so I just plugged in a USB-C drive to the back of the unit and transferred thousands of photos in a matter of minutes.</p><p>The design is elegant, and the bezels around the panel aren't as thick as other photo frames. The 2K resolution (2000 x 1200) is adequate, and 32GB built-in storage means you can easily store thousands of photos; I transferred over 2,000 images to the frame, and it only took up over 3GB of storage. If you have a sizable media library, you can always slot in an SD card.</p><p>The software is minimal, and you get a decent set of options around managing slideshows of albums. You can also set a schedule so the frame automatically turns off at night, get weather notifications, and set up a clock. The touchscreen is fluid and there's no lag while using the interface, and the anti-glare panel makes a decent amount of difference.</p><p>If you need a digital photo frame or are looking to gift one, the Pexar is a great overall option, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fluke-SAFAVIEH-Luxe-Collection-Runner/dp/B0C9H54GLX">$110 makes it a good Prime Day deal</a>.</p><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><em><strong>ultimate buying guide</strong></em></u></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>

What's new and improved is the emoji-style display on its "face" that can be used to emote or communicate with family members or friends.</p><p>While the EBO Air 2 launched at a super reasonable $219.99 launch price, it has become much cheaper now thanks to this Amazon Prime Day deal.

Alongside the fixes, the beta 2.1 has also brought in the latest June security devices for the Pixel 6a and above, including the Pixel 9 series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Users have to remember that it is still the beta release, and some bugs may still persist ‚Äî all of which are likely covered by the time Google comes with the stable Android 16 release, which may be right alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series models.</p><p>The lineup seems to be solid again this time with models including Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

In fact, I'm using it right now as I write this.</p><p>It's not too large and is quite lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag or hold by the included strap, which is a nice touch. I have the black colorway, but I really like the orange. But of course, it's really about the sound.</p><p>The ULT Field 1 is an impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> that produces very loud sound, making it perfect for outdoor gatherings, especially in the summer. I bring it to gatherings pretty often, and while it can't hold a candle to larger stereo speakers, this definitely gets the job done.</p><p>And if you really wanna party, that big ULT button on top seriously amps up the bass, which may be too much for solo listening but is perfect for lively gatherings where people just want to dance. The 12-hour battery life also ensures that you'll be dancing all night long, and the IP67 rating means you can enjoy it at the pool or in the shower.</p><p>Seriously, I love this thing, and I expect many others do, too, hence the 4.6-star rating on Amazon.</p><h2 id="prime-day-2025-android-deals-quick-links-57">Prime Day 2025 Android deals - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Prime Day is coming: see the full list of Amazon deals</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phones:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals?ref_=nav_cs_gb&bubble-id=cell-phones-accessories" target="_blank">major discounts on Samsung and Pixel</a></li><li><strong>Tablets:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablets" target="_blank">discounted Galaxy Tab and iPad</a></li><li><strong>Wearables:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=smartwatches" target="_blank">up to %45 off Garmin watches</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Most Prime Day deals are members-only: sign up for the 30-day trial</strong></a></li></ul><p><em><strong>For everything on Amazon Prime Day, head to our </strong></em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><em><strong>ultimate shopping guide</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong></em></p> ]]></dc:content>
