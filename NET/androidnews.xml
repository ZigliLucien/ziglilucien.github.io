                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Anker is the world's leading charging brand, and its GaN chargers, cables, and power banks are often among the best in their segments. The Prime series consists of the manufacturer's best offerings, featuring elegant designs and the latest GaN tech. The Prime 27,650mAh is Anker's latest product in this portfolio, and with a power budget of 250W and the ability to charge three devices at once, it clearly has a lot going for it. <br><br>The power bank has a new design, with a seamless front that differentiates it from other products. And it isn't that massive considering you get a 27,650mAh battery — I have 25,000mAh power banks that are bulkier. There are other niceties as well, including an LCD panel that shows real-time details, magnetic connectors at the bottom that let you attach the power bank to a charging base, and three ports in total.<br> <br>I get to use a lot of power banks, and I've tested dozens of products in the last three years. So I'm confident when I say that the Prime 27,650mAh is the best power bank in this segment.</p>

<p>Anker unveiled the Prime 27,650mAh 250W Power Bank at the end of 2023, and the power bank is now available globally. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0BYP2F3SG">costs $149 on Amazon</a>, and you can pick it up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.anker.com/products/a1340-250w-power-bank?variant=43739694465174">from Anker's website</a> as well. If you don't like the standard model with the grey color scheme, there's a gold-accented variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Portable-Compatible-Charging-Included/dp/B0C85ZTH35">that retails for $153</a>.</p><p>The power bank costs £179 ($220) in the U.K., and it's available for ₹19,999 ($231) in India.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AbDo3Q4LFR7xcaEooc3fe3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbDo3Q4LFR7xcaEooc3fe3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I mostly used UGREEN and Baseus power banks in recent years, and I have to admit Anker did a great job with the design. The power bank is smaller than a portable Bluetooth speaker while still offering a massive 27,650mAh battery, and that's a design win. If anything, UGREEN started emulating the vertical design with its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ugreen-nexode-25000mah-power-bank-review">Nexode power banks</a> after the success of the Prime, so Anker knows what it's doing in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="pHQjTnrv7ZHUSsNfjwWGb3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pHQjTnrv7ZHUSsNfjwWGb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front has a cleaner look this time, and while the use of acrylic leads to increased smudging, it makes the design stand out. What I like is that there are textured sides, making it easier to hold the power bank. You get the two USB-C and solitary USB-A port at the top, and the bottom contains magnetic pins that can be used with the charging base.</p>
<p>There's a power button on the right, and like most recent power banks, the Prime 27,650mAh power bank has a built-in LCD panel that shows charging details. You get the battery remaining, time left to charge a connected device, and the power button lets you adjust the brightness and toggle Bluetooth.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ejjNfeChrZodZ3mFsDFpd3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejjNfeChrZodZ3mFsDFpd3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part about this power bank is that in addition to the usual USB PD 3.1 charging standard, you get OPPO's SuperVOOC, making it the perfect choice to use with OnePlus and OPPO phones. This is a huge deal, as other power banks are limited to USB PD. But with Anker licensing SuperVOOC tech, it is able to provide the 10V/6.5A power profile necessary for the standard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qKAffyvYxmp54wNVfWP4h3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qKAffyvYxmp54wNVfWP4h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll need to use the USB-A port if you want to take advantage of SuperVOOC tech, with the USB-C ports only offering USB PD's power profiles. I used the power bank with a host of devices under the BBK conglomerate, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, and it did a fantastic job with all of these phones.</p>
<p>Another nifty trick is a trickle-charging mode that's ideal for charging accessories. You'll need to double-press the power button to toggle trickle-charging, and a green indicator LED shows up next to the battery indicator to show this mode is active. This mode uses the USB-A port, and you can connect earbuds, smartwatches, and any other accessories that don't need that much power. Double pressing the power button again switches the power bank back to USB PD mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2FbBpPwfRC24eDNsf8YGg3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FbBpPwfRC24eDNsf8YGg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As you get two USB-C ports alongside USB-A, you can charge three devices at once. Here's a look at the various power profiles, and how it holds up when charging several devices at once:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (65W max): </strong>5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.5A (18W), 10V/6.5A SuperVOOC (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 in (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 out (240W max): </strong>100W + 140W</li><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 + USB-A (205W max): </strong>140W + 65W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A (250W max):</strong> 140W + 92W + 18W</li></ul>
<p>Both the USB-C1 and C2 ports are able to deliver 140W of power over the USB PD 3.1 protocol, and what's interesting is that you get a total 240W power budget when both ports are in use, with one port able to hit 140W and the other going up to 100W. Similarly, you get 140W out of one USB-C port even when the USB-A port is being used at 65W.</p>
<p>The differentiator with this power bank is that even with all three ports in use, you get 140W over USB-C1, with the C2 port going to 92W, and the USB-A down to 18W. What I also like is that you get to charge the internal battery at 140W; other products I tested recently only do 140W one way, falling back to 100W when charging the battery.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jqkrpqzc5E27MRQdyhH2h3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jqkrpqzc5E27MRQdyhH2h3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power bank contains seven 3,950mAh cells, totaling 27,650mAh. The battery size is just under the maximum allowed onto a plane (100Wh), and I didn't have any issues taking the power bank aboard a flight. It definitely got looks from gate security as they were curious about what it is, but there were no problems otherwise.</p>
<p>Charging efficiency is pretty good too, and I was able to charge the Vivo X200 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> in one go and still have battery left. It is in line with other power banks I tested recently, and the size of the battery combined with the 250W power budget makes this a great choice for travel — it's what I'm taking everywhere.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TWzBDDeeMWye2ovBgLwee3" name="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank" alt="Anker Prime 27650mAh 250W Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWzBDDeeMWye2ovBgLwee3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have any problems with the power bank itself, and the only thing I would have liked is the charging base. The accessory charges the power bank at 100W, and it's so much more convenient than plugging it into a USB-C port. But it's available as a $50 extra, and not bundled with the package. <br><br>Outside of that and the fact that the front gets smudged easily, there are no problems with the Prime 27,650mAh power bank.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bknD5SMsTr7MtziigPsYiD" name="shargeek-170-17.jpg" alt="Shargeek 170 Power Bank review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bknD5SMsTr7MtziigPsYiD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no shortage of power banks available today, and if you want a decent option with a big battery, I'd suggest the 65W Baseus power bank. It has a 30,000mAh battery, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/30000mah-Baseus-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B08JV4W4NY">coming in at $79</a>, it is a standout value. Obviously, you miss out on 140W charging and all the other extras, but it is affordable. <br><br>If you need 140W charging, I really like the Sharge 170. It also uses the USB PD 3.1 protocol and hits 140W, and the unique design turns heads. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SHARGEEK-Portable-Charger-Display-Waterproof/dp/B0D2VWVPRX">down to $129 now</a>, so while it isn't affordable, you get plenty of similar features as the Prime power bank.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best power bank currently available</li><li>You need to charge your MacBook via a power bank</li><li>You have a OnePlus phone and need a power bank that does 65W over SuperVOOC</li><li>You need charging stats</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You don't need the massive battery</li></ul>
<p>The Prime 27,650mAh power bank has been faultless in four months of use. I tested it with dozens of phones, several tablets, and a gamut of accessories — including the Steam Deck — and it did a brilliant job delivering a reliable charge to all connected devices. <br><br>The sizeable battery ensures it can easily charge several devices at once, and with both USB PD 3.1 and SuperVOOC compatibility, you get unmatched versatility — I haven't used any other power bank that charges OnePlus devices at 65W. Combine all of that with an elegant design and long-term reliability, and you have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">best overall power bank</a> money can buy today.</p>

<p>A Xiaomi executive has reportedly given consumers an idea of when they can expect its next Ultra flagship phone in China <em>and </em>overseas.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/826/048.htm">ITHome</a>, Lu Weibing, president of Xiaomi's mobile phone department, stated in a video that the 15 Ultra is preparing to debut sometime next month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/01/21/xiaomi-15-ultra-set-for-global-debut-after-chinese-spring-festival/">Gizmochina</a>). Specifically, as Weibing answered burning user questions, he confirmed that the Xiaomi 15 Ultra will see a "simultaneous" release in China and globally following the Chinese New Year, otherwise known as the Spring Festival.</p><p>This leads speculation to <em>believe </em>that the phone will hit the market no later than February; however, Weibing did not explicitly say so.</p><p>Additional information (likely specs and a proper date) will reportedly be revealed by Xiaomi after the New Year.</p>

<p>We've been hearing talks about the Xiaomi 15 Ultra for a couple of months and more so after it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-alleged-delay-and-certification">supposedly hit with a striking delay</a>. Rumors from the Chinese social media platform, Weibo, claimed the OEM "postponed" its original planned release of the 15 Ultra. Strangely, rumors couldn't figure out the specific reason behind the alleged delay. Nonetheless, that's what were met with.</p><p>A subsequent post claimed to have spotted the device running through a certification listing with 90W fast charging, a battery between ~5,400mAh to ~5,800mAh, and satellite texting capabilities.</p><p>What made this delay so unfortunate is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-and-15-pro-with-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-announced-in-china">Xiaomi 15 and 15 Pro</a> debuted in October, but haven't made arrived globally yet. It seems as though the initial pair were awaiting the Ultra model. This rumored delay seemingly affected it as, aside from an FCC appearance, the devices have gone silent.</p><p>Furthermore, a February launch for all three devices seems plausible as Xiaomi did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-launch-and-14-ultra">something similar last year</a>. The company dropped its Xiaomi 14, 14 Pro, <em>and </em>14 Ultra globally on February 25. With the company's mobile phone department president claiming an arrival after the Chinese New Year, perhaps history will repeat itself.</p>

<p>With Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event only a day away, the company is confirming a bit of news we've all been waiting on.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/kr/one-ui-7-%ea%b3%b5%ec%8b%9d-%eb%b2%84%ec%a0%84-%ea%b3%b5%ea%b0%9c-%ec%9e%84%eb%b0%95">Newsroom post</a> (Korean), Samsung confirmed that One UI 7 (Android 15) is preparing to launch on eligible Galaxy S series phones in Q1 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-rollout-galaxy-s-phones/">Android Police</a>). Unfortunately, the post didn't state which devices are slated primed to receive this update; however, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a> and the S23 will likely see the upgrade.</p><p>The company adds that while the One UI 7 upgrade will hit eligible Galaxy S devices in Q1, other "existing" Galaxy devices will receive it "thereafter." So, perhaps this means that devices like its foldables and tablets are waiting until Q2 or later.</p><p>Samsung continues by highlighting a successful One UI 7 beta program period. The company states that as the program began on December 5, it filled up "more than twice as fast as the previous One UI 6" beta. The company adds that many of the beta user comments were about its redesigned UI and "improved usability."</p><p>The post stepped into its Galaxy AI world, to which Samsung says were "praised." Specifically, the company says its updated "Writing Assist" feature was particularly positioned in the testers' good favor.</p>

<p>Samsung's beta program for its Android 15 skin continued as users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-beta-3-roll-out">received a third portion</a> of it earlier in January. The update introduced a host of bug fixes and improvements for various features concerning the software. The OS Game Booster brought in a change to the playback default setting, 120Hz setting, and more. One uI 7's third beta also included the vertical app drawer alongside an updated scrolling interface.</p><p>Elsewhere, Samsung has been busy confirming and highlighting several new features in One UI 7, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">a multimodal upgrade</a> for Sketch to Image. The company states that the software will let users draw with an S Pen or type the description of an image they'd like Galaxy AI to create. This was wrapped in Samsung's supposed quest for a "true AI companion," which could mean <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-potential-bixby-upgrade-unpacked-teaser">more for Bixby, too</a>.</p><p>Samsung is also ramping up the privacy/security of One UI 7 for users through the new "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>." The engine is backed by Knox Vault and is said to store a user's private information in a "secure place" when utilizing its on-device AI services. Then, there's the "Now Bar," which will find a home on the Galaxy S25's lock screen. The small widget will be deeply integrated with a user's apps and plans to deliver curated suggestions for the day.</p><p>With One UI 7 confirmed to hit more Galaxy S series phones in Q1, the big day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">is only one sleep away</a> as Unpacked is slated for January 22.

<hr>
<p>A new leak of the Oppo Find N5 is making the rounds, showing off its design and giving us a peek at what the global version, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-2">OnePlus Open 2</a>, might look like.</p><p>The Oppo Find N5 was previously rumored to be under 4.4mm when unfolded, which would dethrone the Honor Magic V3 as the slimmest foldable out there. OPPO seems to be obsessed with this ultra-thin vibe, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-really-hope-the-oneplus-open-2-doesnt-make-the-same-mistake-as-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">OnePlus CEO Pete Lau even compared it to a pencil</a>.</p><p>Now, as per a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5313402944/Pako9ofOQ" target="_blank">Weibo post</a> by the Chinese phone maker, the upcoming Oppo Find N5 foldable is so thin when unfolded, it’s almost as slim as its USB-C port (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/19/oppo-find-n5-oneplus-open-2-thin-design-teaser/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Oppo product manager Zhou Yibao shared images highlighting this impressive design and pointed out that the only thing keeping it from being even thinner is the size of the charging port itself.</p><p>Furthermore, the images show the Find N5 side by side with an iPhone, and the difference is wild. The foldable looks about half the thickness of the iPhone when unfolded, making it seriously compact.</p><p>Another image compares the N5's slim profile to a stack of two quarters or just four credit cards.</p>

<p>The upcoming foldables from Oppo and OnePlus may also raise the bar for water resistance. In another post, Zhou revealed the phone’s IPX9 rating, meaning it can handle high-pressure, high-temperature water jets. While it skips official dust protection (that’s what the ‘X’ means), it’s also rated IPX8 for submersion and IPX6 for lower-temperature water jets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">Foldable smartphones</a> often fall short when it comes to dust and water resistance. Take the OnePlus Open, for example—it only has an IPX4 rating, meaning it can handle light splashes but not much more. This lower level of protection is pretty common in foldables, likely because the complex folding mechanisms make it tricky to seal them up tightly.</p><p>The OnePlus Open 2 is likely to include the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, so expect some serious power under the hood. What’s really cool, though, is the massive battery—it’s rumored to be the biggest ever in a foldable.</p><p>Oppo is set to introduce its next-gen foldable in February, so the OnePlus Open 2 is probably not far off.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim that Samsung is beginning to develop a new 200MP periscope telephoto lens with a 1/1.5-inch sensor.</li><li>While the rumor is void of more details, speculation states this new hardware could arrive on future Galaxy Ultra phones like the S26 Ultra.</li><li>Samsung recently detailed its new ALoP camera technology, which is designed to benefit the future of its telephoto lenses.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors have reportedly surfaced about what Samsung could have in store camera-wise for the future of Ultra model phones.</p><p>Prominent Weibo leaker, Digital Chat Station (DCS), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PasZcp1fa?pagetype=profilefeed">posted a claim</a> on the platform stating Samsung is working on a souped-up, high-zoom camera lens (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-200mp-telephoto-camera-rumor/">SamMobile</a>). Rumors claim the Korean OEM is starting to develop a new 1/1.5-inch periscope telephoto sensor at 200MP.</p><p>Strangely, the tipster didn't have any more details to share about the photography capabilities of this camera lens. The publication speculates this new hardware could arrive for future Galaxy S Ultra devices, like the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:628px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.63%;"><img id="Fqig9UgXLCtfgcLUU5MwLR" name="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-periscope-telephoto-development-rumor" alt="A post on Chinese social media site, Weibo, from a leaker who claims Samsung is working on a 200MP periscope telephoto lens." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fqig9UgXLCtfgcLUU5MwLR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="628" height="274" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Digital Chat Station / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there's no telling <em>when </em>this 200MP telephoto lens could debut, speculation placing it with the S26 Ultra could fit with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huge-samsung-megapixel-camera-production-rumor">several other camera rumors</a>. Old rumors claimed Samsung was working on producing the following larger ISOCELL sensors: 200MP (HP7), 50MP (GN6), and 440MP (HU1). Those rumors also speculated that Samsung was working on another 320MP sensor for its future generation of Ultra models.</p><p>Concerning the rumors, the publication notes how two popular Chinese brands have recently opted for 200MP telephoto lenses: Honor and Vivo. Specifically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review#section-vivo-x100-ultra-cameras">Vivo X100 Ultra</a> utilizes a Samsung-made 200MP HP9 telephoto sensor with a 1/1.4-inch lens and 3.7x optical zoom capabilities. So, it seems that Samsung is familiar with such camera strength, but opting for a periscope will offer a little more zoom range.</p><p>Additionally, maybe we'll see this new periscope telephoto upgrade packaged with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">Samsung's new ALoP camera tech</a>. The company stated it was developing a new piece of tech called ALoP or All Lenses on Prism, which is designed to deliver a more powerful camera experience while keeping the module slim. With Samsung seemingly more interested in thinner phones, this <em>might </em>be the future we're looking at.</p><p>Samsung stated the tech could accommodate a camera with an <em>f</em>/2.5 aperture on an 80mm lens. So, not only could its zoom increase, but so too could its ability to shoot in darker scenarios at night or indoors.</p><p>Whatever the case may be, facing our immediate future is the Galaxy S25 series, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">will debut tomorrow</a>, January 22. With only a day to go, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">ultimate guide</a> to the new series to prepare.</p>

The 12GB of RAM and Tensor G4 chipset offer enough processing power to handle nearly all tasks with ease, plus you get loads of AI-powered software features and seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed. Like most Google phones, the Pixel 9 also features great haptics and battery life, and the 120Hz AMOLED display could easily rival any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market.</p>

<p>Caseology is a spectacular phone case brand that has been around for almost a decade. What started out as a tiny little business venture started by a bunch of friends selling out of their apartment eventually grew into one of the most reliable phone case brands in the world. Shockingly, the brand quietly closed shop for good towards the tail end of December 2024.</p><p>I've been testing accessories, with an emphasis on cases, for many years now. Each year, the biggest smartphone names in the biz would launch new iterations of their flagship phones. And each year, Caseology would produce affordable, stylish, and durable cases to accompany those top-of-the-line devices.</p><p>It saddens me that the brand will no longer be around. The timing is even more unfortunate for die-hard fans of the brand. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Galaxy Unpacked 2025</a> event is mere hours away, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a> set to debut on that day.</p>

<p>Caseology has almost always been one of my top recommendations for phone cases, but the brand's December 2024 demise means it will miss the S25 launch.</p><p>It isn't all bad news, however.</p><p>In case you weren't aware, Caseology was the sister company of another wildly popular phone case maker: Spigen. Fortunately, Spigen will be absorbing two of Caseology's most popular lineups, the Nano Pop and Parallax series. The duo consists of funky cases with a pop of color as well as more demure offerings with luxurious design language.</p>
<div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDpahjJS5JE/" target="_blank">A post shared by Caseology (@caseology)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div>
<p>The Caseology Parallax series of phone covers is such a massive crowd favorite that some folks buy it for every single phone they buy. I've had a friend admit this to me in confidence, and I couldn't fault them one bit. Regardless of the phone, Caseology's cases are always robust, featuring military-grade drop protection, and always priced below $20. It's a very happy occurrence that these two lineups will not go extinct.</p><p>Unless you live under a rock, you've probably heard of the Spigen. The brand has been voted the best phone case manufacturer by Android Central's team many times in the past.</p><p>Spigen has quite a few legendary case series of its own — one of which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-case-saves-iphone-from-16000-foot-fall">helped a phone survive a 16,000-foot fall from a plane</a> — so it's going to be a major win for the brand to add the Nano Pop and Parallax series to the roster.</p>

<p>With the S25 release happening so soon, I'm excited to see what Spigen will do with its newly acquired cases. We've seen tons of exciting new products from the brand, including a lot of cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe accessories for both iOS and Android</a> devices as well as chargers and screen protectors.</p><p>It will be good fun to have Parallax or Nano Pop-themed phone grips and Qi2/MagSafe accessories from Spigen. And the best part is, since they're all sister brands, we won't see a price hike or drop in quality in the Caseology products adopted by Spigen.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-could-bring-qi2-revolution">Galaxy S25 series is probably going to have Qi2</a> support, I'm excited to see what Spigen has in store for us. I'm counting on the team behind the brand to continue the colorful legacy of Caseology and its lively accessories.</p><p>Rest in peace, Caseology. You did well.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Baseus makes high-quality charging accessories, cables, and power banks, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/ditch-your-boring-cable-this-retractable-100w-usb-c-cable-is-much-better-and-its-on-sale-for-cyber-monday">retractable cables</a> in particular are very good. The brand is leaning heavily into retractable tech, and integrates it into all of its charging stations. That's why I was excited to take a look at the Nomos, its latest product that has all the charging ports you need — including Qi2. <br><br>The charging station is designed to be used on your desk, and it has three USB-C ports, one USB-A port, and an angled wireless charging stand that works over the 15W Qi2 standard. The Nomos is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Charging-Certified-Magnetic-Retractable/dp/B0DHV7LR12">available on Amazon for $149</a>, and Baseus is incentivizing its availability with a $20 discount, bringing it down to $129.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dJq2xouYSEJ6JcuhiUXKBg" name="Baseus Nomos" alt="Baseus Nomos 140W Charging Station review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dJq2xouYSEJ6JcuhiUXKBg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a lot of charging stations in the house, and the Nomos stands out for its portability; it is smaller than most of its rivals, and the inclusion of a Qi2 charger adds much greater versatility. I don't normally use wireless charging as I don't like having a dedicated accessory on my desk, but Baseus's solution makes it highly convenient to use, and the charger has strong magnets, doubling as a phone stand.</p>

<p>As is the case with most Qi2 chargers, you'll ideally need to use a case with your Android phone — this isn't a problem with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>. The best part about the Nomos is that a USB-C cable is built into the enclosure, so you don't need to use any other cable if you need to charge a single device. The retractable cable goes up to two meters, and the connector has a magnet that allows the cable to attach to the side of the Nomos when not in use.</p>

<p>The built-in cable goes up to 100W of power, and just like the brand's dedicated cables, it has six preset lengths that you can use. If you need additional power, the USB-C3 port hits 140W over the USB PD 3.1 standard, and this is the port that got the most amount of usage. I tested it with 140W power banks and notebooks, and it did a great job delivering reliable power.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6FjpqeZsDadBYSCHZMuJ9g" name="Baseus Nomos" alt="Baseus Nomos 140W Charging Station review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6FjpqeZsDadBYSCHZMuJ9g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another thing that's of interest is the built-in panel; I'm a big fan of these on power banks, and it's good to see brands integrating the modules into charging stations as well. The panel allows you to see ports in use and real-time charging stats — including the Qi2 stand.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H2y8u6dHwGELkwFgpiAH8g" name="Baseus Nomos" alt="Baseus Nomos 140W Charging Station review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H2y8u6dHwGELkwFgpiAH8g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Baseus did a great job with the design itself; the Nomos doesn't take up too much room, and it has rubber feet at the bottom that ensures it stays planted on a desk. It connects via a detachable barrel plug, and other than the Baseus logo on the front panel, Qi2 label, and 140W written on the side, you don't get much in the way of branding.</p>

<p>The only issue with the design is that the side that houses the USB ports has a glossy coat, and it picks up smudges and scratches. There's a power button on the side that lets you toggle between the two available pages on the LCD screen; an overview showing all ports, and a screen showing the overall wattage that is going out.</p>
<p>Coming to the charging side of things, the Nomos has USB PD 3.1 and PD 3.0 alongside PPS, and you also get Qualcomm's QC3.0. Both the USB-C1 and C2 ports go up to 100W each, and as mentioned earlier, the C3 port hits 140W. The solitary USB-A port is limited to 15W, and Qi2 is also 15W.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YFDTy4yHreDND3bYorFoDg" name="Baseus Nomos" alt="Baseus Nomos 140W Charging Station review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFDTy4yHreDND3bYorFoDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With all four USB ports in use and the Qi2 charger active, you get a 140W power budget, and the power going to individual ports changes based on the scenario. Here's a rundown of the power profiles you get with the Nomos:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C1/C2 out (100W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W)</li><li><strong>USB-C3 out (140W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/5A (100W), 28V/5A (140W)</li><li><strong>USB-A out (15W max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W)</li><li><strong>Qi2 out:</strong> 15W</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2/USB-C1 + C3/USB-C2 + C3:</strong> 134W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3: </strong>140W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + USB-A: </strong>140W max</li><li><strong>USB-C2 + C3 + USB-A:</strong> 140W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-C2 + Qi2:</strong> 140W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + USB-A + Qi2:</strong> 130W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 + C3 + USB-A:</strong> 140W max</li><li><strong>USB-C1 + C2 +C3 + USB-A + Qi2: </strong>140W max</li></ul>
<p>That was a lot of data, and what you basically need to know is that the Nomos does a great job at charging up to five devices at once. I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, a half-dozen power banks, and several Android tablets, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wkW4FtEdiwNQdEoqVtNaDg" name="Baseus Nomos" alt="Baseus Nomos 140W Charging Station review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wkW4FtEdiwNQdEoqVtNaDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's notable about the charging station is that it is smaller than other options, and I like the built-in cable. But the biggest differentiator is the Qi2 charging stand; it basically means I don't have to use a phone stand on my desk, and that alone makes the Nomos worthy of recommendation. If you need an all-in-one desk charger, this is the one to get.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>UGREEN has an extensive portfolio of charging products and docking stations, and the brand broke into the storage segment last year, debuting its NASync series. I tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp4800-plus-nas-review">DXP 4800 Plus</a> and the SSD-only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp480t-plus-review">DXP480T Plus</a> back when they launched, and it was immediately clear that UGREEN is delivering the best hardware of any brand in this category. <br><br>That's the case with the DXP2800 as well, UGREEN's 2-bay solution. The NAS is powered by Intel's N100 platform, has 8GB of memory, and 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity. You also get dual M.2 slots, USB-C and USB-A connectivity, and an HDMI port. UGREEN put a lot of thought into the design and hardware, and while the brand's software was barebones at launch, that has changed considerably over the course of the last 12 months. <br><br>So, if you want a new 2-bay NAS and need something with plenty of power, here's why the DXP2800 may just be the best choice available right now.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-dxp2800-pricing-and-availability"><span>UGREEN DXP2800: Pricing and availability</span></h3>

<p>UGREEN unveiled the DXP2800 in Q1 2024, and the NAS is now available globally. It costs $349 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dxp2800-nas-storage">on UGREEN's website</a>, and you can bring it down to $314 by using code <strong>DXP2800</strong>. It's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP2800-Quad-core-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22HBFK1">available on Amazon for $314</a> when you use the code on the listing page.</p><p>If you need additional drive bays, there's a 4-bay model dubbed the DXP4800, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ugreen.com/products/ugreen-nasync-dxp4800-nas-storage">available for $495</a> as of writing.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ugreen-dxp2800-design"><span>UGREEN DXP2800: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N4VsVGXGssJ2dSCj4P35dD" name="UGREEN DXP2800 NAS" alt="UGREEN DXP2800 2-bay NAS server review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N4VsVGXGssJ2dSCj4P35dD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most 2-bay NAS servers have a plastic chassis, but UGREEN clearly paid a lot of attention to the design, and the chassis of the DXP2800 is made entirely out of aluminum alloy. The metal construction gives the NAS a sizeable heft, and it is the heaviest 2-bay server I used in recent years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9HmDj4erYAJhuj9N2TZDbD" name="UGREEN DXP2800 NAS" alt="UGREEN DXP2800 2-bay NAS server review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9HmDj4erYAJhuj9N2TZDbD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Weight obviously isn't a consideration with these things, but the build quality of the DXP2800 is easily the best in this category, and there are no issues with the design. The dark grey color scheme makes the NAS unassuming, and it does a decent enough job blending into the background. You don't get much in the way of branding either; there's a UGREEN logo on the sides, but the black text is barely visible against the grey color.</p>

<p>The NAS is taller and wider than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DiskStation DS224+</a>, so you need to take that into account if you're slotting it into an entertainment cabinet. There are the usual status indicators at the front, the power button is located next to the LEDs, and what I like is that there's a USB-C port alongside the usual USB-A connectivity.</p>

<p>The drive bays are numbered, and they're individually lockable. Another positive with the design is that UGREEN has an ingenious tool-less system to slot in 3.5-inch drives, and it is the easiest of any NAS server I used. There's a solitary 90mm fan at the back, and it has a magnetic dust filter that ensures it doesn't get too much in the way of dust. <br><br>If anything, the design does a great job minimizing dust. I have to clean my other NAS servers every three months of so because of the sheer amount of dust that gets accumulated, but that just hasn't been a problem with the DXP2800.</p>

<p>UGREEN did a good job with connectivity, and the DXP2800 has 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet at the back. While that's great by itself, I would have liked to see two ports at the back — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/asustor-nimbustor-2-gen2-as5402t-review">ASUSTOR's AS5402T</a> and TerraMaster F2-424 include dual 2.5GbE connectivity, and the DXP2800 is on the backfoot in that regard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nirAkA7KDu9qYCGxaC5moD" name="UGREEN DXP2800 NAS" alt="UGREEN DXP2800 2-bay NAS server review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nirAkA7KDu9qYCGxaC5moD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Still, the solitary 2.5 Gigabit port should be adequate for most users eyeing this NAS. You also get HDMI out, dual USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.2 ports — one at the back and the other located up front — and USB-C connectivity, so you can easily connect external drives to the NAS and transfer data over.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RpRPyKzRBA25syV6z4SzdD" name="UGREEN DXP2800 NAS" alt="UGREEN DXP2800 2-bay NAS server review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpRPyKzRBA25syV6z4SzdD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS has a built-in 32GB eMMC module that has the UGOS software installed, and each of the drive bays accommodates drives up to 24TB each. There are two M.2 2280 slots inside the chassis (located next to the drive bays), and you can technically add 8TB SSDs in each slot, bringing the total addressable storage to 64TB. <br><br>There's 8GB of DDR5 memory installed out of the box, and you can easily switch the modules if you need additional memory. The SO-DIMM slots are located on the underside, and they're easily accessible.</p>

<p>The DXP2800 has the best hardware in its class, and Intel's N100 platform is noticeably better than the Celeron J-series products that have been a mainstay in this category over the last decade. It has hardware transcoding, and doesn't consume as much power as its predecessor — something that makes a difference on a device that's powered on 24/7. <br><br>UGREEN's UGOS Pro software is much better in 2025, and the web-based OS has similarities to DiskStation Manager, so if you're migrating from a Synology NAS, you shouldn't have any issues. You get the usual network configuration options, and there's two-factor authentication to safeguard your account. UGREEN has a remote access service as well, but you should just use Tailscale to connect to the NAS when you're away from your home network.</p>

You get the usual network configuration options, and there's two-factor authentication to safeguard your account. UGREEN has a remote access service as well, but you should just use Tailscale to connect to the NAS when you're away from your home network. <br><br>You get native clients to manage photos, videos, and music, and there's the option to spin up a VM too. That said, you don't get any productivity utilities, and this is an area that UGREEN needs to address. Similarly, there's no Plex client but Docker lets you easily install Plex as a container, and it runs just as well as a native client. <br><br>I set up the DXP2800 as my main NAS, and transferring data over 2.5GbE was in line with other NAS servers I tested recently. There are no problems in this area, and I didn't see any issues with Plex or streaming content to other devices in general. <br>Hardware transcoding is efficient, and you will need a Plex Pass to utilize transcodes; it's worth getting one if you have a large media library and cast to older devices. <br><br>Mobile connectivity is decent as well, and you can easily back up photos and videos on your phone to the NAS. The best part is that you can install TrueNAS or any other OS of your choosing if you want to switch. This extensibility makes the DXP2800 a particularly great choice as you're not tied to one OS.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the DXP2800 but need dual Ethernet ports, TerraMaster's F2-424 is the ideal option to consider. This 2-bay NAS also has great hardware, and is powered by Intel's N95 platform. I like what TerraMaster is doing with its TOS 6 software, but you also get the option to use TrueNAS. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F2-424-NAS-Storage-2Bay/dp/B0CXPBM2DF">in at $379</a>, the F4-424 is costlier than the DXP2800, but you get arguably better software and dual 2.5GbE connectivity.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a powerful 2-bay NAS server</li><li>You need 2.5 Gigabit connectivity</li><li>You want a NAS that's built to last</li><li>You want to install TrueNAS on your NAS</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a NAS with the best value</li><li>You want plenty of software utilities pre-installed</li></ul>
<p>While I traditionally suggested the DiskStation DS224+ as the default choice if you need a 2-bay NAS, the DXP2800's hardware combined with software potential and extensibility make it an easier recommendation. UGREEN did a better job with the build quality, the N100 platform is among the best in this category, and you get hardware transcoding as well. <br><br>There are no issues with the NAS in daily use, and it does a great job with the essentials — backing up data from phones and other devices, file transfers, and accessing your data from anywhere. I would have liked to see additional software utilities pre-installed, but that will come later this year, and with Docker integration, you can install everything you need. Plex runs well on this NAS, and if you have Plex Pass, you can leverage hardware transcoding. <br><br>Ultimately, the build quality and hardware give the DXP2800 an advantage, and the UGOS software is decent enough that it's no longer a limitation. The pricing is on the higher end of the scale, but you're getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best home NAS servers</a> around.</p>

But then Tecno partnered with Hasbro to release a limited-edition model of the device with Transformers livery, and that obviously piqued my attention. <br><br>Most limited-edition phones tend to be high-end devices, so it's good to see brands going this route with budget and entry-level phones. POCO did the same thing with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">X7 Pro Iron Man Edition</a>, and I definitely want this to become a trend. Anyway, the Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition switches out the mundane design of the regular model with a yellow and black colorway, and it looks pretty great.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kyzMbNVtKLKkH2QXYUhFbK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kyzMbNVtKLKkH2QXYUhFbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back is on the busier side, but it doesn't look ungainly in the least, and the etched pattern underneath the glass makes the device look much more upmarket. The camera island is centered, and it also gets a yellow color scheme with the individual lenses encircled in rings. Rounding out the design is the Transformers logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>What I also like is that the sides have a matte texture — more brands need to do this. Another positive is the 3.5mm jack located at the bottom; Tecno somehow continues to retain the port on its budget phones, and it's a refreshing change of pace. The SIM card tray sits to the right, and you get stereo sound.</p>

<p>Tecno did a decent job distilling the essence (as it were) of the beloved Transformers character into the device — this is a design that's sure to turn heads. The brand nailed the packaging as well, and if anything, Tecno put in more effort than some high-end limited edition phones I used in the past. If you're not sold on the yellow color scheme, Tecno has a second model that's based on Optimus Prime, with this variant decked out in blue and red.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Yj8wkMmw6LpzCWMffYkgbK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yj8wkMmw6LpzCWMffYkgbK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The device itself shares the same hardware as the standard model, and that means a 6.78-inch LCD panel with 90Hz refresh, MediaTek's Helio G91 with ancient Cortex A75 and A55 cores, and 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage and a microSD slot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oFtb3qUgiUat6KzXTfvXdK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oFtb3qUgiUat6KzXTfvXdK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a 64MP camera at the back alongside a 13MP wide-angle lens, IP64 ingress protection, and a 5000mAh battery with 18W charging tech. Obviously, this thing won't win any hardware awards, but considering it costs the equivalent of $160 in most markets where its sold — predominantly Africa and Southeast Asia — you do get a lot for what you're paying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="TyiNWqBBLU2zmAnRSx6ecK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TyiNWqBBLU2zmAnRSx6ecK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2608" height="1118" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, there is noticeable lag even in daily use, including tasks like navigating the interface and browsing. That's a given with the hardware on offer, but it is usable, and the 90Hz panel makes a difference. Battery life is great as well, and the device easily lasts over a day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Eiq2GPaWv46NeqFSmro4fK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Eiq2GPaWv46NeqFSmro4fK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone runs HiOS 14.5 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>, and Tecno's software is heavily styled. If anything, the Bumblebee Edition is worse in this regard, as you get a custom icon pack that borders on garish. Thankfully, you can easily change the icon pack, and as this is a limited-edition device, you get a set of unique backgrounds — both Bumblebee and Optimus Prime are included.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZJven5vt7XDgncQVbi5QaK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJven5vt7XDgncQVbi5QaK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There is plenty of bloatware out of the box, but it can be uninstalled, so it isn't too much of an issue. Outside of that, there isn't much to talk about the software. While other Chinese manufacturers have made positive strides in the last three years to clean up their interface, Tecno still has some ways to go in this area, and I want to see what the brand does with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cCcLYZBGCBewtC5NJeM8aK" name="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition" alt="Tecno Spark 30 Bumblebee Edition review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cCcLYZBGCBewtC5NJeM8aK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the Spark 30 is a good budget phone that handles the basics well. The standard model is decent enough in its own right, and when you add in the exclusive color option with the Bumblebee Edition and all the extras, it becomes just that little more enticing. I would have liked better hardware, but it's undeniable that you are getting a good value considering it costs around $160.</p>

<p>X (formerly Twitter) is trying to capitalize on the rocky TikTok scene. The platform came up with its own video "feed" by adding a new tab to the explore page that just showcases videos for users to scroll through. In a tweet, the social media platform joked about "not making a video tab" while posting a video showcasing the same.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">you better not be making a dedicated video tab when I get homeme: pic.twitter.com/ZbmLBmSbDp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1881169030876381414">January 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The new "immersive new home for videos" was rolled out to U.S.-based users yesterday (Jan. 19) and showcased a vertical video tab mimicking TikTok/Instagram reels based on the user's interest/accounts they follow.</p><p>Considering the platform was banned for roughly half a day over the weekend, other social media sites wanted to leverage this and came up with their versions to slide into user's DMs.</p><p>For instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">Instagram introduced a new "edits"</a> app resembling CapCut, a video editing software from ByteDance. "Edits is a free video editor that makes it easy for creators to turn their ideas into videos, right on their phone. It has all the tools you need to support your creation process, all in one place."</p><p>X showcases videos that go along with its tweets. However, this feed seems to give users a combination of videos that are both in a 9:16 aspect ratio and as well as landscape ones, much like Instagram (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/x-twitter-dedicated-vertical-video-tab/" target="_blank">via Android Police</a>).</p><p>From the looks of it, this feature is currently only available on the mobile app and showcases minute-long videos.  There's not much information as to whether this tab will become available to people outside the U.S., and if so, when can we expect a broader rollout to happen?</p><p>Meanwhile, U.S. TikTok users rejoiced as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us" target="_blank">the app made a comeback </a>over the weekend after the ban went into effect and the app went dark. The official TikTok Policy account on X (formerly Twitter) shared a statement on Sunday, Jan. 19, announcing that it restored service as a result of President Trump's support.</p><p>The company wrote in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tiktokpolicy/status/1881030712188346459?s=46" target="_blank">post,</a> "We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive."</p>

Additionally, the report purports that the Korean OEM could produce roughly 200,000 units of the tri-fold style device for consumers.</p><p>The tipster on X chimed into a reply about the rumored number of units. Jukanlosreve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1881226660177236380">claims</a> that the number "is limited to the tri-fold;" however, Samsung is supposedly looking to reach that number "over the course of a year."</p><p>Samsung will allegedly begin production on its Galaxy tri-fold in Q2, which gives us a timeframe between April and June.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Korean report continues by stating the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is on its way this year, but it could lack an S Pen digitizer. A Fold <em>without </em>a digitizer was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">rumored in November</a> with a report claiming it could help make the device thinner — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Fold 6 Special Edition</a>. The tipster adds that there's a "high chance" for this to happen in 2025.</p><p>The primary difference here is that the Fold 6 Special Edition does not support the S Pen at all alongside its lack of a digitizer to make it slimmer. The previous report suggests Samsung is interested in crafting a Fold that lacks a digitizer but still supports the S Pen, kind of like the current rumors.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Korean publication's video claims there are a two more foldables expected: the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Flip 7 FE. The devices are rumored to launch in Q3 2025, which lines up with Samsung's past summer Unpacked events.</p>

<p>Another rumor from earlier in January claimed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored">2025 would be the year</a> Samsung revealed its double-folding phone. Rumors stated the company could debut the phone without a UDC (under-display camera). Also, the device could fold in a "G" shape for durability and screen protection purposes. Samsung Display was also rumored to have new screen tech ready to debut, which could happen during MWC 2025.</p><p>That same rumor added that Samsung could produce "under 300,000" units. Current speculation suggests around 200,000, something that might have to deal with its interest in slashing foldable totals <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">after a lackluster 2024</a>.</p><p>Regarding the Fold 7's S Pen digitizer, removing it could force users to have an S Pen <em>they </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">need to charge</a> instead of letting the phone handle it. Such an idea was put forth late last year as a Korean report claimed Samsung was looking to change its S Pen hardware and opt for one that's slightly larger. The stylus would also (likely) leverage active electrostatic (AES) technology to manage its own operations.</p>

<ul><li>After witnessing the Galaxy S25 Slim recently, a new leak reveals the regional availability of the handset.</li><li>The slimmer form factor Galaxy S25 series device will probably see its launch in countries like the U.K., India, and Australia among 39 regions.</li><li>However, the United States doesn’t appear to be on the list, corroborating the earlier reports of the same.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung releasing a fourth Galaxy S25 device out of the traditional trio of devices in the upcoming Unpacked event was already a surprise for many. It is likely to be dubbed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Slim and is now tipped to launch in at least 39 regions.</p><p>The region availability information was obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/exclusive-the-galaxy-s25-slim-may-land-only-in-these-locations_id166780">PhoneArena</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-slim-launch-only-39-countries/">SamMobile</a>), and the list seems to omit the U.S. region. The other regions where we are likely to see the new Galaxy S25 Slim launch include:</p>
<ul><li>Afghanistan</li><li>Australia</li><li>Austria</li><li>Brazil</li><li>Caucasus</li><li>Croatia</li><li>Egypt</li><li>France</li><li>India</li><li>Iraq</li><li>Ireland</li><li>Israel</li><li>Kazakhstan</li><li>Kenya</li><li>Libya</li><li>Malaysia</li><li>Mexico</li><li>Morocco</li><li>Nigeria</li><li>Pakistan</li><li>Philippines</li><li>Poland</li><li>Portugal</li><li>Russia</li><li>Saudi Arabia</li><li>Senegal</li><li>Serbia/Montenegro</li><li>Singapore</li><li>Slovenia</li><li>South Africa</li><li>Sri Lanka</li><li>Switzerland</li><li>Thailand</li><li>Tunisia</li><li>Turkey</li><li>UAE</li><li>United Kingdom</li><li>Uzbekistan</li><li>Vietnam</li></ul>
<p>Several rumors have been floating about the Galaxy S25 Slim’s availability for a while now, and there were speculations about the handset's release at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Unpacked Event</a> as well—which is commencing this Wednesday (Jan 22) in the U.S. alongside other regions, including South Korea's home ground.</p><p>Regardless of the launch and availability of the Galaxy S25 Slim, it is an interesting handset from Samsung to look forward to. The latest addition might be a notable option to choose from for those who are waiting to purchase the Galaxy S25 trio.</p><p>Although the design should resemble the other Galaxy S25 models like rounded corners, a triple camera array, and thinner bezels, the slimmer form factor of the handset appears to be the key takeaway — at least that appears to be the parameter — per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">recently leaked renders</a>.</p>

<p>In comparison, the Galaxy S25 Slim should be measuring 6.4mm in thickness, which is supposedly 1.8mm thinner than the alleged Galaxy S25 Ultra phone. The overall dimensions of the device are likely to be set at 159x76x6.4mm.</p><p>Other specs of the slimmer Galaxy S25 device include a Snapdragon 8 Elite Galaxy chipset coupled with at least 12GB of RAM. The triple camera array could include a 200MP primary lens, next to a 50MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera offering 3.5x zoom.</p><p>If not at the upcoming Unpacked event, we are likely to see the Galaxy S25 Slim sometime in the second quarter of this year probably right before the usual launch of Galaxy foldable phones.</p>

<ul><li>Another discovery involves the rumored ASUS ROG Phone 9 "FE" in a pair of certification listings overseas.</li><li>The device has apparently surfaced in Malaysia and Thailand, with rumors pointing — once again — to a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 decision.</li><li>The "FE" phone reportedly grabbed Wi-Fi Alliance certification in November as it was tested with Android 14.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A recent discovery might tell us a little more about the upcoming, Samsung-like "fan edition" phone from ASUS.</p><p>The latest ROG Phone 9 "FE" discovery surfaces courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/id/hub/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-kantongi-sertifikat-pertanda-akan-segera-rilis/">91Mobiles</a> from the SIRIM certification database (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/asus_rog_phone_9_fe_is_coming_and_it_might_be_familiar-news-66170.php">GSMArena</a>). More exciting specifications like its features, display, and cameras are reportedly still unknown. However, the publication claims the device could feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC.</p><p>This chip theory allegedly stems from the model number in the Phone 9 FE's files. According to data from a Malaysian and Thailand listing, the device is codenamed "ASUS_AI2401_N." The publication then ties this number to the one used for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-8-series-launch">Phone 8 series</a>: "AI2501C." The series dropped at the beginning of January 2024 with the SD 8 Gen 3, which leads to the recent assumptions that the company's Phone 9 FE could contain the same.</p><p>The chip did wonders to help phones in 2024 with on-device AI capabilities, a push ASUS made with its Phone 8 <em>and </em>Phone 9 series.</p><p>Additionally, there's some speculation that the device could see a launch in the southeast Asia region "soon."</p>

<p>Rumors of an ASUS ROG Phone 9 FE cropped up last November when the device allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-fe-databse-listing-rumors">showed up in a Wi-Fi Alliance</a> listing. The certification database stated the phone was being tested with Android 14; however, others theorize it could see Android 15 by the time it's in our hands. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity is expected. Moreover, that listing is what originally put the idea of a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 swap in our minds — and the latest rumors double down on it.</p><p>For context, the flagship Phone 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Phone 9 Pro</a> debuted in November 2024 with Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC. That chip drastically improved the power and efficiency of the company's chips with the new Oryon CPU cores. More importantly, the chip has consistently been reported to be more costly due to its vast improvements.</p><p>If ASUS is interested in going down a similar "fan edition" or FE route as Samsung, then dropping its chip to one from a generation prior could help. An FE tag screams affordability, but a change in the chipset won't get this done alone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-series-launch">main flagship duo</a> offers a 6.7-inch display and a triple camera array; however, the base Phone 9 starts at $999. It also features a 50MP primary lens, a 13MP ultrawide lens, and a 5MP macro camera instead of a telephoto.</p><p>So, perhaps ASUS will look at toning down its on-device AI gaming features or its cooling capabilities (but hopefully not). A launch date hasn't been narrowed down yet, so we'll just have to keep waiting.</p>

<ul><li>An early set of Google leaks claimed to have spotted the company's Pixel 10a and Pixel 11 series development.</li><li>The Pixel 10a is allegedly being developed with the "slightly boosted" Tensor G4, while four codenames for the Pixel 11 series drops.</li><li>Previous rumors claim that Google will place the stronger Tensor G5 into the Pixel 10 series in 2025, which recently had its supposed set of four codenames leak.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>These Google Pixel leaks might catch you off guard as a tipster picked up on an alleged set of devices in development.</p><p>According to prominent leaker Kamila Wojciechowska (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/exclusive-pixel-10a-pixel-11-codename-3516163/">Android Authority</a>), Google has reportedly started working on five new Pixel phones. Among the devices, the tipster states that Google is already developing its planned Pixel 10a, codename "STA5." This leak is extremely early, seeing as the company's flagship Pixel 10 series won't arrive until later in 2025.</p><p>Regardless, the post claims the Pixel 10a <em>could </em>debut with the same Tensor G4 the Pixel 9 series features. If you remember, the Tensor G4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">didn't receive the huge improvements</a> we were looking for.</p><p>Speculation suggests the Pixel 10a will debut in 2026; a safe assumption, considering the "A-series" Pixel never arrives the same year as the flagships.</p><p>Elsewhere, Wojciechowska has allegedly discovered the internal codenames for the 2026 Pixel 11 series. The tipster reportedly found four devices: "cubs," "grizzly," "kodiak," and "yogi." These names refer to the Pixel 11, Pixel 11 Pro, Pixel 11 Pro XL, and the Pixel 11 Pro Fold, respectively. The post states the series will likely rock the Tensor G6 SoC. It's a likely scenario given the recent struggles and shifts Google has had to make with its custom chipset.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A4wRsPwjhJssSQAt24Uq6P" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Top-down view of Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4wRsPwjhJssSQAt24Uq6P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">benchmarking tests</a> for the Tensor G4, it was clear that Google made a few improvements with it over the G3. While the chip wasn't surprising anyone — and certainly not outdoing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3-launch">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> — it did help cut down on the Pixel line's long history of overheating issues. However, that only seemed to concern the higher-tier devices, like the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>The base Pixel 9 still got warm, just not <em>as much </em>as previous generations.</p><p>Google had reportedly encountered severe problems with its teams centered behind the Tensor G4, which led to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-samsung-upgraded-tensor-g4-process">delay in the original project</a>: Redondo. Essentially, Google reportedly had to lean on Samsung once more for the chip inside the Pixel 9 series, which brought onboard a 4nm, third-generation SF4P process chip. The tech behind it was stated to offer a "slight" upgrade over the G3 and we've seen those effects since launch.</p><p>What we've turned our attention to since is the Pixel 10 series. Those devices should sport Google's completely custom, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g5-chip-testing-preparations">in-house Tensor G5 chip</a>. A January 2024 report claimed that Google had already started testing its chip ahead of its TSMC switch for the Pixel 10 under "project laguna." Moreover, with rumors suggesting the Pixel 11 will see four phones like the Pixel 9, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">Pixel 10 series saw the same chatter</a>.</p><p>Last September saw a leak claim to discover four codenames for the Pixel 10 series alongside more assumptions behind its usage of the Tensor G5.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google began early previews of the much-anticipated Android 16 last November with the rollout of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">first developer preview</a>. Very quickly, the next version of the operating system followed. However, a new tip has now indicated we might be seeing the first beta releases to the public as soon as this week to the masses.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-beta-release-date-3517882/">Android Authority</a> contributor AssembleDebug’s new findings, we are likely to see the first beta rollout of Android 16 as early as January 22—right in time for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Unpacked event,</a> where Samsung is preparing to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>On the other hand, the second beta is believed to be coming on February 19, and the Android 16 beta 3 should be arriving on March 12 to compatible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:81.86%;"><img id="nQ278YNY7o3uYW4vscPLXa" name="Android-16-beta-release-dates-leak" alt="Android 16 betas release dates leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQ278YNY7o3uYW4vscPLXa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="733" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AssembleDebug/ Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The release schedules’ dates are spotted through a comment on Android Gerrit — made by a Googler — and it evidently puts the Android 16 beta releases significantly months before when compared to the previous iteration, Android 15 beta releases.</p><p>Google has already noted that Android 16 will have an earlier official rollout than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and the released Android 16 developer previews were already an indication. New findings from the publication only reaffirm the case.</p><p>As mentioned, the Android 16 is expected to ship to Pixel devices by the second quarter of this year, which usually wasn’t the case before. The publication further notes that with the hinted beta release schedule, the latest operating system from Google is likely to arrive at a stable state after which, users can expect a couple of other beta releases followed by the official rollout. It could mean right before the Google IO event, which is yet to be announced by the search giant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.25%;"><img id="ET6VQxPCmiVobyxmeWrkV" name="Android-16-dp1" alt="Android 16 developer preview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ET6VQxPCmiVobyxmeWrkV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="939" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Android 16 developer previews, on the other hand, introduced several new notable features. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">second preview</a> version has introduced “private space, ” which happens to be a new privacy-focused functionality allowing users to hide important apps in a secure and separate profile. Alongside such features, new security measures are also in place with Android 16.</p>

In this case, it is audio cables; Effect Audio is a brand that makes high-quality audio cables, and the Code 24 is the latest product. <br><br>What makes its cables stand out, you ask? Well, a lot of it is down to the quality of the construction, and the materials used. There's also the design of the cable itself, and having used several dozen IEMs, I'm yet to come across a cable that looks anywhere as good as the Code 24. The caveat obviously is that the cable costs a ridiculous amount of cash — it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.effectaudio.com/code-24">retails for $799</a> — and while it definitely makes a difference to the sound quality and is built to last, it isn't targeted at a mainstream audience.</p>

<p>Before we get to the design, a high-level overview of the construction of the cable itself: the Code 24 uses 16.5AWG gauge wires with UP-OCC silver-plated copper Litz material, and each wire uses a blend of multi-size strands — 13 in this case. The core of the cable is what Effect Audio calls a Trio-Flex Pure Solid Core System, and this contains three wires made out of the same UP-OCC silver-plated copper Litz material. <br><br>Covering all of this is an EA UltraFlexi insulation that gives the Code 24 a decent amount of resilience in daily use. Clearly, a lot of thought and attention went into the construction of the cable, and it is noticeably bulkier than most standard cables.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PeC95JEqjT2t7MMkq8BxVi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeC95JEqjT2t7MMkq8BxVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the defining characteristic of the cable has to be the design. The rich blue hue combined with the barrels and gold accents gives the Code 24 a distinct presence, and I can confidently say that this is the best-looking cable I've ever used — photos don't do it justice. The cable has a hybrid design that's braided until the splitter, and then straightens out at the connectors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mFeSNcduNaAMsu4Ejdmtai" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mFeSNcduNaAMsu4Ejdmtai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Talking about connectors, the Code 24 has a 4.4mm plug as standard, but you can get an interchangeable connector that adds 2.5mm and 3.5mm options. On the other end, you get a standard 2-pin connector, and Effect Audio bundles a ConX connector set that includes MMCX as well. It's easy enough to switch between the two, and the versatility means you can use it with any IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="iaYBTiM2xCDsNDXZerv9fi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iaYBTiM2xCDsNDXZerv9fi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The cable has a standard 1.2 meter length, and because of its construction, it is heavier than just about any other IEM cable I used. Thankfully, you don't notice the heft in daily use, but I wouldn't recommend using these on the road. On that note, Effect Audio includes a decent-quality carrying case with the Code 24, and it securely holds the cable along with IEMs and has inner pockets to accommodate the connector attachments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gLCs3ZKFB8Ny3dxAdfZGfi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLCs3ZKFB8Ny3dxAdfZGfi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the cable with a half-dozen IEMs, including the likes of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/elysian-acoustic-labs-pilgrim-review">Elysian Acoustic Labs Pilgrim</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fa19-review">Fiio FA19</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-fx15-review">FX15</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-prestige-ltd-review">Thieaudio Prestige LTD</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/letshuoer-cadenza-12-review">Letshuoer Cadenza 12</a> among others. I paired it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">M23</a>, and what was immediately noticeable was the elevated low-end; the Code 24 delivers a richer bass with better presence and noticeable impact, and you get a greater texture that's just enjoyable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3FXFMFZuSjG52WUdE24qbi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FXFMFZuSjG52WUdE24qbi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The mids remain neutral but with added clarity, and vocals in particular sound great — there's added weight and body to the mix that creates a sense of occasion. There's a hint of sparkle to the treble that adds a bit of warmth, but there's no sibilance or harshness. <br><br>There's terrific resolution throughout, and the soundstage feels expansive; Effect Audio did a brilliant job with the technical details. I'll admit that I was skeptical of the Code 24 as I didn't think it would make any tangible difference to the sound quality — but I was wrong. The cable clearly adds a lot of nuance and dynamics that you just don't get with bundled cables, and this is particularly true of high-end IEMs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FTgZDTbA8rM3vbi2RirEdi" name="Effect Audio Code 24" alt="Effect Audio Code 24 audio cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FTgZDTbA8rM3vbi2RirEdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, the Code 24 is aimed at enthusiasts looking to get the most out of their IEMs. Justifying the price is difficult, but if you've already invested in top-of-the-line IEMs and want something that will make a genuine difference to the sound, the Code 24 is a great choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I covered Stuffcool extensively over the years, and the brand is my go-to recommendation for charging products in India. I used the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-max-power-bank-review">Major Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/stuffcool-major-ultra-review">Major Ultra power banks</a> in the last year, and while they did an admirable job charging my devices, they're on the bigger end of the scale. <br><br>That's where the Giga comes in. The power bank also has a 20,000mAh battery, but it is considerably smaller, making it easier to carry around. If anything, the design of the power bank reminds me of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/review-ugreen-145w-25000mah-power-bank-review">UGREEN's power banks</a>, with the gunmetal grey color scheme and LED panel similar to what the Chinese manufacturer offers on its own products.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3ExPwdaWwxqnr77PRJyX8T" name="Stuffcool Giga" alt="Stuffcool Giga 65W power bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3ExPwdaWwxqnr77PRJyX8T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The smaller design is a definite advantage with the Giga, and another feature I like is that the power bank has an integrated 65W USB-C cable; there's a built-in cable tie to ensure it doesn't tangle, and the design means you don't have to dig around in your bag to find a USB-C cable. <br><br>Another point in its favor is that the power bank is on the lighter side at 360g, and just like the design, this makes a difference in portability. The sides have a ridged pattern that makes it that much easier to hold and use the power bank.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oxhQPpthKzNdWVuhHCReBT" name="Stuffcool Giga" alt="Stuffcool Giga 65W power bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxhQPpthKzNdWVuhHCReBT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a tiny LED panel at the front that shows remaining battery. I would like liked a bigger panel that highlighted real-time charging info as well, but this is a good starting point nevertheless. Overall, the build quality is on par with the best power banks I used, and there are no qualms in this area. <br><br>Coming to the charging part, you get 65W out via USB PD, and that's enough to charge most phones. Like recent Stuffcool power banks, you get the ability to charge at 65W over the USB PD PPS standard as well, making the Giga a fantastic choice to use with Samsung phones.</p>

<p>I only have two minor issues with the Giga; the power bank is limited to 45W when charging the internal battery, and it takes a lot longer to charge the 20000mAh battery than most other power banks I used in recent months. Also, there's just one USB-C port alongside USB-A, and while this is decent on smaller power banks, it would have been great to get dual USB-C ports. <br><br>Outside of that, there are no problems with the Giga; the power bank managed to deliver a consistent charge when using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">Vivo X100 Pro</a>. If you're interested, here's a rundown of the power profiles:</p>
<ul><li><strong>USB-C Out (65W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB PD PPS Out:</strong> 3.3V - 11V/5A (55W), 3.3V - 20V/3.25A (65W)</li><li><strong>USB-A Out:</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/2A (18W), 12V/1.5A (18W)</li><li><strong>USB-C In (45W Max):</strong> 5V/3A (15W), 9V/3A (27W), 12V/3A (36W), 15V/3A (45W), 20V/2.25A (45W)</li></ul>
<p>Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.in/Stuffcool-Smallest-Powerbank-superfast-fastcharges/dp/B0DMDZF5SV">at ₹3,999 ($46) on Amazon India</a>, the Giga doesn't cost too much more than other 20,000mAh power banks in this category, and the lighter design combined with 65W charging tech makes it a good choice if you need a new power bank — particularly to use with Samsung phones.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta</a> and Instagram are hoping to capitalize on the uncertainty surrounding ByteDance apps by teasing a new one of their own: Edits. Many creators and indie video editors were shocked when CapCut, a popular vertical editing software, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">affected by the TikTok ban</a> enacted Sunday, Jan. 19. The new Edits app is a direct competitor to CapCut announced by Instagram head Adam Mosseri on the very same day the ban of ByteDance apps took effect.</p><p>In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-classic-stickers-reels-ig-stories">Instagram Reels</a> video announcing the new app, Mosseri directly acknowledged the timing of the move. "There’s a lot going on right now, but no matter what happens, it’s our job to provide the best possible tools for creators," he wrote.</p><p>"Edits, an Instagram app" is already available for pre-order on the Apple App Store, but is not listed on the Google Play Store yet. Mosseri says Edits won't become available for download until next month. The Instagram exec said that Edits will be "coming to Android soon," but it's unclear whether it'll launch on the Play Store at the same time the iOS app becomes available for download next month.</p>

"Edits is a free video editor that makes it easy for creators to turn their ideas into videos, right on their phone. It has all the tools you need to support your creation process, all in one place."</p>

<p>Meta is clearly trying to gain user base and momentum in light of the questionable future for ByteDance apps. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">TikTok became available in the U.S. Sunday</a> following a brief shutdown after earning incoming President Donald Trump's blessing. However, other apps — including CapCut — appear to still be unavailable.</p><p>Additionally, there are multiple legal requirements that must be met for TikTok and ByteDance apps to earn a more permanent extension, and full compliance in the U.S. Until those hurdles, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title15/chapter123&edition=prelim" target="_blank">as outlined in the U.S. law banning the apps</a>, are crossed, TikTok and other ByteDance apps are far from out of the woods.</p><p>By teasing an Edits app, doubling the maximum length of Instagram Reels, and adding other features, Instagram is looking to take advantage of an unfortunate situation for one of its biggest competitors. It's not the first time Meta used this strategy to launch a competing social media app. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-threads-now-live">Meta launched Threads</a>, a Twitter rival, when Elon Musk's changes to X left users scurrying from the platform.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm quietly announced a binned version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with seven cores.</li><li>Offering the same clock speeds as the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite, this new variant has one less performance core.</li><li>This version of Qualcomm's pricey chip could offer reprieve to OEMs struggling to incorporate Snapdragon 8 Elite in their devices without raising prices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm makes the fastest Android mobile chip on the market today, the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and its processor lineup looks to be expanding. We've already heard rumors that the brand could be prepping a lower-tier Snapdragon 8s Elite chip and a higher-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-specifications-leaked">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> system-on-a-chip. Now, the chipmaker has quietly announced a separate seven-core Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, according to a newly-listed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/content/dam/qcomm-martech/dm-assets/documents/Snapdragon-8-Elite-SM8750-3-AB-Product-Brief.pdf" target="_blank">document</a>.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-7-core-3517839/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, this new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip appears to be identical to the regular version, minus a performance core. It's listed under part number <strong>SM8750-3-AB</strong> on Qualcomm's website. You'll get two Prime cores with this chip, just like the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite, but only five performance cores instead of six.</p><p>This could be a "binned" Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. SoC binning is when a chipmaker offers a lower-cost and lower-performance version of a processor with cores disabled, and it's a way to get usage out of chips that may not meet the general quality control and yield requirements for the regular variant.</p><p>Although one performance core appears to be disabled on this Snapdragon 8 Elite variant, everything else is the same, including the clock speeds. The two Prime cores are clocked at up to 4.32GHz, while the five performance cores are clocked at up to 3.53GHz.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:129.13%;"><img id="LE8EtCa5YaVXJtrCRHyDoM" name="Qualcomm-Snapdragon-8-Elite-7-Core-Spec-Sheet" alt="A spec sheet for the Snapdragon 8 Elite variant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LE8EtCa5YaVXJtrCRHyDoM.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1030" height="1330" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although this lesser Snapdragon 8 Elite model and its 2+5 configuration will undoubtedly be weaker than the full-fledged Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unclear by how much. If the binned Snapdragon 8 Elite chip with seven cores provides similar performance to the octa-core Snapdragon 8 Elite, it could be enticing to OEMs. It has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">widely reported that the Snapdragon 8 Elite is more expensive</a> than past Snapdragon chips, and a cheaper chip would be an attractive option for midrange devices.</p><p>However, due to the wide variety of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship devices</a> that offer an eight-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, it's unlikely that OEMs would be able to use the seven-core variant in a smartphone without offering a lower sticker price.</p><p>We'll have to wait for this new Snapdragon 8 Elite variant to show up in a device to test how it compares to the standard Snapdragon 8 Elite. Additionally, it's worth keeping an eye out for the other Snapdragon 8 Elite revisions rumored to debut soon, like the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite "for Galaxy" and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Snapdragon 8s Elite</a>.</p>

On Christmas, I drove to my parents' house with a plastic Safeway bag carrying 13 smartwatches and asked my bemused relatives if they wanted to help me with an article. Most of them had never worn a smartwatch, which made them <em>perfect</em> for my little experiment.</p><p>I poured out a messy pile of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, and an Apple Watch onto my mom's festive tablecloth. Then I told each judge to place them in a row, with the "prettiest or coolest" watches on the left and the "ugliest or most boring" on the right, focusing on which devices they'd "actually want to wear."</p><p>All told, I got 21 participants across generations, ranging from my 80-year-old great-aunt to my teenage nephews and niece. After each vote, I'd mix the watches back into a pile so that the previous person's choices wouldn't influence their decision.</p><p>Why did I rope my relatives into this little experiment? Even though I try to make my smartwatch reviews as objective as possible, focusing on battery life, performance, and fitness accuracy, a lot of people will choose a watch solely based on looks, comfort, and vibes. And I think that can be a blind spot for me.</p><p>I'm happy wearing bulky, sporty watches or heavier models to get better battery life, and I think tech reviewers have gotten used to smartwatches' thick, machine-cut look. But when my mother told me that my Garmin watch looked like a "spaceship on my wrist," it got me thinking that I should try and recalibrate my mental image of a good-looking watch. Hence, the smartwatch beauty pageant!</p><p>CES 2025 kept me busy after the break, but I finally got to tally up the votes this week. And I bet you'll be as surprised by the results of my smartwatch beauty pageant as I was!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="h35Nrb2WyCqecZVAjYVusQ" name="Smartwatches-beauty-ranking-1" alt="A top-down view of thirteen smartwatches sitting side-by-side on a desk. In order, they are the OnePlus Watch 2R, Withings ScanWatch 2, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Google Pixel Watch 3, Coros Pace Pro, Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Garmin Fenix 8, Fitbit Charge 6, Amazfit Cheetah Pro, Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra, Fitbit Sense, Apple Watch Ultra 2, and Garmin Instinct 2X Solar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h35Nrb2WyCqecZVAjYVusQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I chose 13 smartwatches for my test: the Amazfit Cheetah Pro, Apple Watch Ultra 2, Coros Pace Pro, Fitbit Charge 6, Fitbit Sense, Garmin Fenix 8, Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, Google Pixel Watch 3, OnePlus Watch 2R, Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro, Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, Galaxy Watch Ultra, and Withings ScanWatch 2.</p><p>I tried to have a fair split between "sporty" and "mainstream" watches, as well as expensive and affordable ones. I made a point of including the Charge 6 and Sense to see how a fitness band or a generic-looking squircle would compare in people's minds to fancier or traditional rounded smartwatch designs.</p><p>I wasn't sure whether to include the hybrid ScanWatch 2, as it seemed too different from the rest with its classic look, but I was curious how much non-techy people would care about an old-school impression or if it would feel too old-fashioned for the Gen Zers.</p><p>While I had more smartwatches I considered including, I didn't want to overwhelm my family with too many choices. They came to party and socialize, not do an unpaid survey.</p><p>I chose not to charge my smartwatches before the test; would <em>you</em> want to spend Christmas morning charging watches? I had a justification for it: I wanted people to focus on the watches' physical designs, and I thought brighter displays or prettier watch faces might subconsciously sway their votes. Still, you might disagree with the decision since it's hard to judge how a smartwatch looks without the display turning on.</p><p>Finally, I told my relatives to try and ignore the color of the smartwatch bands when the first couple told me they hated the orange bands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. I assured them that these straps could come in different colors.</p>
<h2 id="the-results-of-my-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-2">The results of my smartwatch beauty pageant</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1123px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:41.41%;"><img id="KP9pAFpd5ERgKk9CdUTGhJ" name="Smartwatch-beauty-pageant-tallied-votes" alt="A table tallying the votes for 13 smartwatches (in alphabetical order), ranked from 1st through 13th." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP9pAFpd5ERgKk9CdUTGhJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1123" height="465" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The table above shows how many votes each smartwatch received from 1st to 13th place. The table below shows the total points, with the contestants ranked from most to least points. I gave a proportional amount of points for each vote: First place is worth 13 points, second place 12 points, and so on, down to one point for 13th place.</p><p>As you can see, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a> crushed the competition, somewhat predictably. Many family members didn't like what <em>most</em> of the smartwatches looked like and told me that the hybrid watch might be the only one they'd seriously consider wearing.</p><p>But you might be somewhat surprised to see the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> come in second. Everyone seemed to love its distinct scale bezel and flat look, preferring its rounded aluminum case to the fancier titanium of many rival watches. Considering the ScanWatch 2 is <em>barely</em> a smartwatch with its tiny OLED display, you could call the Watch 2R the real winner of the pageant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1206px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.88%;"><img id="5XiRqsgpkJoopNzv78SGiJ" name="Smartwatch-beauty-pageant-total-score-ranks" alt="A table showing the tallied points for 13 smartwatches, ordered from most to least points.

<p>Almost no one liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a>, the last-place pick, but I fully expected that. It's a massive, niche watch for outdoorsmen. One person told me it looked like something Master Chief would wear and that she expected Cortana to hop out of it.</p><p>What surprised me more is how little people cared for the three most expensive smartwatches: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> (7th), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> (8th), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> (12th). They all lost to the Fitbit Sense (6th), which one family member called "so generic-looking that it makes me mad." The Sense looked light enough that my female family members, in particular, thought it would be the most comfortable and "ordinary."</p><p>That's a pretty big knock against all the tech reviewers like myself who gave these flagship watches glowing reviews and praised their unique designs. People didn't mind the Fenix 8 because it was flat and "normal-looking," but it was simply too big for a lot of them, and they didn't like how many buttons it had. As for Apple and Samsung, their hard-edged, square-ish looks made them look both artificial and "too massive."</p>

<p>Samsung's older smartwatches did better; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> (4th) divided the voters, with some loving its unique rotating bezel and others finding that it made the watch too big. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a> (3rd), which Samsung has all but abandoned, captivated people with the strength of its unique sunken bezel and metallic look.</p><p>Honestly, I can't discount how much people liked the Pro simply because of its shining silver in a sea of black watches. But the white <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-gps-and-hr-accuracy-test">Coros Pace Pro</a> (10th) and titanium-bezel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-cheetah-pro-review">Amazfit Cheetah Pro</a> (11th) discount that theory a bit. Their brightness only highlighted how "cheap" and "unattractive" they looked, with only a few of my more active relatives appreciating the Pace Pro's lightness for workouts.</p><p>The most polarizing candidate was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> (5th). It was ranked top-four for nearly half of the voters, with three first-place votes from family members who loved its rounded, relatively light look. But other voters had visceral reactions to it looking "like nothing," like a "creepy water drop," or "like a naked chicken breast without any seasoning." My family has a unique way with words.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I thought these watches looked pretty neat!

<p>21 people is a decent focus group, but this test was hardly definitive or properly controlled. In a perfect world, I'd have ensured each watch case and strap was the same color, that the displays were active, and that people weren't peeking at other people's votes out of interest before they voted themselves.</p><p>Still, I feel like I learned some lessons from my experiment:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Size matters. Most people didn't like the tiny Fitbit Charge 6, but they also cared more about a comfortable fit and thin case than a large display.</li><li>People don't care if a big watch is proportionally light thanks to titanium; they'd rather it be compact and won't notice if it's aluminum.</li><li>They cared much more about how the watch looked from the top-down (what they'd see) than from the side (what others would see), which makes the bezel (or lack thereof) extremely important.</li></ol>
<p>This test reminded me why Apple Watches outsell every other brand, beyond name recognition and iPhone dominance. They're thin and petite and safe-looking, and they don't invite unflattering comparisons to non-smart or hybrid watches like rounded smartwatches do.</p><p>Android smartwatches can't help but look "too big" to people outside of the tech space, though the 40mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or 41mm Pixel Watch 3 might escape that label. So even though I prioritize larger displays and batteries and so on, I need to remember when reviewing smartwatches that a lot of people might see my positives as negatives.</p>

Not only does it save me from ads on either platform, but Google has slowly turned YouTube Music into a pretty decent streaming service. There’s a lot to like about it.</p><p>However, I haven't used Spotify since we were in the thick of the Covid-19 pandemic, and even then, I wasn’t subscribed to it. So, I thought it might be good to revisit the app and actually take advantage of Spotify Premium to see what I’ve been missing out on.</p><p>Most of my friends and family use Spotify, and it seems much more omnipresent than the other music streaming apps when it comes to third-party integration. It’s pretty hard to escape Spotify, and using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a>, I often feel a bit left out when new features are released or when anyone shares links to songs that I can’t listen to because I’m not subscribed.</p><p>After using Spotify exclusively for the past month, here are the things I like about the app, the things I still miss about YouTube Music, and whether or not I could see myself making the switch permanent.</p>

<h2 id="the-features-that-made-me-switch-2">The features that made me switch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU" name="Spotify-Jam" alt="Spotify Jam" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xiSaKKC5vQVxF8rM7NZufU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The decision to switch didn’t come to me overnight. It’s something that I first considered doing during a New Year’s Eve trip in 2023 when I was in Hawaii with my friends. Someone is usually playing music for us to enjoy while we’re relaxing, playing games, or driving to and fro. Everyone else had Spotify, which I didn’t normally think about much prior to the trip, but there was one feature in particular that made me realize just how much I was missing out.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-jam-sessions-announcement">Spotify Jam</a> is an incredibly useful feature that launched in the fall of 2023. It lets one person set up a “Jam,” which is essentially a queue of tunes that they can invite others to join in on. Anyone in the Jam can add songs and manage the order of songs, making it a collaborative DJing effort.</p><p>I love this feature because it lets everyone mix up the music queue and show off each others' music preferences. I have a pretty eclectic taste in music, and while my friends enjoy it when I DJ, I know my tastes don’t always agree with everyone in the room, and there are certain genres or songs that I may not be too privy to that others may love.</p><p>Because of this, I made a point to make the switch to Spotify Premium ahead of our 2024 New Year’s Eve trip so that I could a Jam myself since I was the main one DJing this time around with my new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-ult-field-1-review">Sony ULT Field 1</a>. Spotify Jam also made it so I didn’t have to set up a playlist beforehand, which saved me a lot of time as we would just create a queue in real time. This feature alone made it worth subscribing to Premium, and if you’re late to the party and haven’t tried this feature out yet, I recommend it the next time you and your friends get together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3958px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U" name="Spotify-Smart-Shuffle" alt="Spotify Shuffle options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egZqqnKeSfVHiy34hWAP8U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3958" height="2226" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another feature I absolutely love is a bit less flashy but almost as important to me. Spotify has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-new-home-feed-previews">Smart Shuffle</a> feature that will insert songs it thinks you will like when you shuffle a playlist you’ve created.</p><p>I sometimes find it difficult to discover new music, as I often become comfortable with what I know and like. I have several playlists that I cycle through depending on my mood, and so I’m very familiar with just about every song. I’ll often add a song every so often, but my playlists tend to stay pretty stagnant. This is why I like the Smart Shuffle feature so much; it keeps me in familiar territory while giving me something new to listen to that matches the other tunes in my playlist; that way, it doesn’t stick out so much or ruin the vibe.</p><p>Spotify’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-ai-dj-curated-music">AI DJ</a> was also a feature I was really intrigued by, as it’s seemingly yet another way to discover tunes based on the music you like. The AI-generated DJ interjects every few songs to set up your listening experience, changing the vibe every so often with songs you’re familiar with or may like. It’s a unique feature that I find quite music, as it almost feels like you’re listening to the radio, something I don’t do much of these days.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1303px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="99Zc2AYEwfZBg6QiSTfa4j" name="spotify-ai-dj-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Spotify's new AI DJ in the mobile app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99Zc2AYEwfZBg6QiSTfa4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1303" height="732" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the execution is far from perfect. The DJ will often switch to genres or artists that I have zero interest in, and I feel like it will jump in to change the vibe of the tunes a little too often. Sometimes, I just want to stay in the same vibe or feeling for a while, and the DJ will switch things up at a whim, which feels quite jarring at times.</p><p>No doubt it’s a cool feature, one I think Spotify should tweak a bit. However, it does highlight one of my biggest problems with switching to Spotify, one that makes me miss YouTube Music.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-miss-about-youtube-music-2">Things I miss about YouTube Music</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4141px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U" name="Spotify-and-YouTube-Music-1" alt="Two phones next to each other with Spotify and YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7X3A6kvqLQFqcU7ByhXv5U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4141" height="2329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the best things about YouTube Music is that the app seemed to know me before I even started using it. When I first subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> over the pandemic, I was surprised at how well the app was able to guess my tastes by recommending songs that I ended up loving. This is because YouTube Music is tied to the main YouTube app, and so my music searches throughout the years would influence YouTube Music’s knowledge of me.</p><p>This is something I am struggling with when it comes to Spotify. The app’s music recommendations just feel subpar compared to my experience with YouTube Music, and I find myself skipping songs more often than not. That’s not to say it’s all bad, and the songs that show up in Smart Shuffle are often great. But whether it’s via a song radio or the AI DJ, Spotify doesn’t seem to really get me.</p><p>Of course, I recognize that this is more of a growing pains situation and that the app will have to take some time to get used to my tastes. My previous experiences with Spotify were pretty limited, so it doesn’t have much to go on, which is evident whenever I compare my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-your-spotify-2020-wrapped-apple-music-replay-youtube-music-year-review">Spotify Wrapped and YouTube Music Recap</a> every year. I can't be too hard on the app for not fully understanding my tastes, but I find that this is something that often makes me want to go back to YouTube Music.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold-5-with-fold-4-youtube-music.jpg" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 running YouTube Music next to a Greygreen Galaxy Z Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ccKfeyTdunELrNHpcJSWdN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another thing that I find lacking on Spotify is the selection of music, but not so much in the way you might think. I’m a big fan of remixes and often prefer them over the original mix. Spotify has a vast selection of music and remixes, but I’ve learned pretty quickly that this is still pretty limited compared to YouTube Music.</p><p>The thing about YouTube Music is that its connection to YouTube makes it a much stronger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming platform</a>, in my opinion. I find some of the coolest remixes completely out of the blue, and even when a particular song or mix isn’t available as a music track, I still have instant access to the song via a YouTube video without ever having to leave the app. And as a nice bonus, I can watch full music videos if I want to, which comes in handy when I’m on the treadmill and need visual stimulation.</p><p>I’ve already become pretty disappointed at the fact that I can’t find many of my favorite mixes on Spotify, but the lack of music videos right now is also pretty disappointing. Spotify may be a music streaming service with a focus on audio, but music videos are a pretty fundamental part of the music listening experience.</p>
<h2 id="will-i-stay-or-will-i-go-2">Will I stay or will I go?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L" name="Spotify-hero-android.jpg" alt="Spotify logo on an Android phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N8YDEEixyqyFevodQ3Ni8L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1999" height="1124" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After using Spotify for a couple of months, it's clear to me why it's such a popular platform. The app experience feels much more mature, for lack of a better word, and Spotify has a lot going for it despite the long wait for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-tier-code-deep-dive">long-awaited Hi-Fi tier</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google is continuously tweaking the YouTube Music UI on what feels like a daily basis. It feels like Google is trying to slowly turn YouTube Music into a Spotify clone, which isn't a bad thing, but it speaks volumes to just how good of an app experience it is.</p><p>That said, while Spotify is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-central-best-of-2024-apps-services">a favorite of ours here at Android Central</a>, with some genuinely fun and useful features, the biggest thing keeping me from staying in the actual <em>music</em> experience. Spotify just doesn't know me as well as YouTube Music, and I'm not sure I want to put in much more effort teaching Spotify to learn about my likes and dislikes. After all, I'm here to listen to music that I want to hear, and right now, YouTube Music knows exactly what that is.</p><p>For now, I'll continue using Spotify to see how things improve, but there's a good chance I'll go back to YouTube Music for my music needs.</p>

<p>If you already know that you’re going to pick up one of the new Galaxy S25 models, you don’t have to wait just to save some money. All you have to do is head over to the Samsung Galaxy Reserve landing page, enter your information, and voila! You’ll save $50 right off the bat, but will also be able to save an additional $1,250 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect">when trading in your old phone</a>.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s take a look at everything that has been leaked or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors">rumored about Samsung’s upcoming flagship phones</a>. Starting out with the Galaxy S25, the rumor mill didn’t really start picking up until the second half of the year. <br><br>Before that, a rumor back in June suggested that the regular Galaxy S25 wouldn’t see any meaningful camera upgrades. This would mean that the Galaxy S25 would sport a 50MP main lens, along with a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto sensor offering 3x optical zoom.</p>
<p>One of the big questions was whether Samsung would opt to stick with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-may-be-all-snapdragon-again-not-all-exynos">Qualcomm</a> for the Galaxy S25 series, or if we would see Exynos chips. According to a report by analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Samsung’s production of its latest Exynos SoC ended up with a “lower-than-expected yield.”</p><p>Because of this, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-bye-exynos-qualcomm-galaxy-s25-rumor">Samsung would</a> instead rely on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4, which turned out to be called the Snapdragon 8 Elite. This initial report was corroborated by a separate rumor, which also suggested Samsung would opt for Qualcomm across the board, instead of utilizing its Exynos chips in certain regions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It wasn’t until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vanilla-galaxy-s25-model-alleged-render-leak">September 2024</a> that we got our first idea of what the Galaxy S25 would actually look like. Honestly, it was rather pedestrian, with the biggest change coming to the rear camera housing, which was said to now sport the same camera rings as what’s found on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>However, this same batch of leaks claimed Samsung will be slimming down the Galaxy S25 a bit, with the following dimensions: “146.9 x 70.4 x 7.2mm, compared to 147.0 x 70.6 x 7.6mm for the S24.” All while still sporting a 6.2-inch display, complete with flat edges and rounded corners.</p>
<p>Shifting gears a bit, if there’s one thing that we’ve complained about for years it’s how far behind the curve Samsung is with charging speeds. While some flagship phones can be recharged in less than an hour, Samsung hasn’t gotten the memo. Unfortunately, after the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-galaxy-s25-plus-charging-speed-leak">passed through China’s 3C</a> for certification, it seems that the 25W charging rate is here to stay for another year.</p>

<p>With the company coming off a rather disappointing launch of its latest foldables, there were questions about what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-parts-orders-production-report">Samsung’s Galaxy S25 sales target</a> would look like. In October 2025, a report surfaced claiming Samsung “expects to produce roughly 22 million Galaxy S25 phones by June 2025 and approximately 11 million could be Galaxy S25 Ultras.”</p><p>This would mean that the Galaxy S25 would “account for ~30%” while the S25 Plus is expected to sell a bit better, “as its outlook puts it around 35% to 40% in sales.” As a note, these figures are only for North America and don’t account for global markets.</p>
<p>Switching back to the devices themselves, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-color-options-tipped">display analyst Ross Young shared</a> the different colors that we can expect to see with the Galaxy S25 lineup. Coming as little surprise, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will share four colors, with the Plus gaining a “Midnight Black” option. Meanwhile, the S25 Ultra is said to be offered in four different shades of Titanium, which include “Titanium Black, Titanium Blue, Titanium Gray, and Titanium Silver.”</p>
<p>In November 2024, Samsung held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-galaxy-s25-teases-cheaper-foldable-xr-device-2025">most recent earnings call</a>, which provided confirmation that the Galaxy S25 lineup would arrive in the “first half of 2025.” Unsurprisingly, no other details were shared, with the only exception being that the S25 “plans to lead daily innovation by increasing the experience perfection of Galaxy AI and expand sales by strengthening marketing and experience programs.”</p><p>Despite remaining fairly cryptic, Samsung also teased a few other devices, such as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Android XR headset</a> and a cheaper foldable phone. Following Google’s announcement of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> late in 2024, we’re keeping our fingers crossed that Samsung at least shows off its upcoming headset. Even if it’s done in the same way that the Galaxy Ring was first officially teased.</p>

<p>Less than two weeks after Samsung first confirmed the existence of the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-to-launch-on-january-22-or-23-2025"><u>it was reported</u></a> that the company was “sending consumer surveys to random customers.” Of note, these surveys were looking for opinions about the “promotional aspect of Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S25 series.” Upon completion, you would receive a “10% discount on the Galaxy S25 series on January 5.”</p><p>A few days later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-to-launch-on-january-22-or-23-2025"><u>multiple leaks</u></a> began suggesting that Galaxy Unpacked would be held on either January 22 or January 23. Additionally, it was expected that Samsung would host its flagship launch event in San Francisco, following in the same footsteps as the Galaxy S24 launch.</p><p><br>It would have been odd to see pre-orders open on January 5 as it was a Sunday. However, it turns out that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025"><u>Samsung announced Galaxy Unpacked</u></a> on January 6, just a day after you would’ve received the discount.</p>
<p><strong>What Galaxy S25 preorder deals can you expect?</strong></p><p>We’re still waiting for an official look at the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-preorder-deals-what-to-expect"> <u>Samsung Galaxy S25 preorder deals</u></a>, but our eCommerce Editor Patrick Farmer has spent the last several months speculating on the offers we can expect when the phones go live.</p><p>According to Patrick, if past years are any indication, Samsung will be the first retailer to list its S25 preorder deals online. Be prepared to see some great trade-in opportunities, plus free storage upgrades and exclusive color variants. Carriers like Verizon and AT&T typically follow closely behind Samsung with their own trade-in deals and new customer offers, with offers that might even get you a free phone if you can meet the eligibility requirements. If you prefer unlocked devices, sites like Amazon and Best Buy generally list their stock later in the afternoon with free gift cards and storage upgrades. Of course, this is all just speculation, but we’ll be sure to share the official offers as they go live following Unpacked.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we had only seen unofficial renders of Samsung’s 2025 flagship trio, but two days before Thanksgiving, that all changed. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaks-on-video"><u>post on Reddit</u></a>, someone seemingly managed to get their hands on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, showing it off in a brief video.</p><p>The video doesn’t really reveal too much, as it only shows off half of the phone. But it did practically confirm that Samsung would be opting for a flatter design all the way around. It also revealed that the rear cameras would feature a black ring, similar to what we first saw on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p>
<p>Just hours later, more supposed real-world images of the Galaxy S25 Ultra surfaced. Although it was unclear whether these were from the same person who posted the video on Reddit, these images offered a clearer picture of what to expect.</p><p>On the bottom, the layout remains unchanged, with the S Pen in the bottom-left corner, followed by the speaker, USB-C port, and SIM card tray, in that order. Two other images showed off the notification that appears when the phone is plugged in, along with a close-up of the thinner bezels.</p><p>That wasn’t everything that was shown off, as the leak also provided a few screenshots of One UI 7. At this point, Samsung had not yet released the first beta for Galaxy S24 owners, so it was kind of interesting to see what was in the cards. Unfortunately, the only major change we could see was with the redesigned</p>
<p>The next day, we received an early Christmas present <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-fcc-listing-details-confirmed"><u>courtesy of the FCC</u></a>. All three models of the Galaxy S25 were found in the FCC database, providing confirmation of a few key details. With the Galaxy S25 Ultra, it was discovered that along with continuing to include an S Pen, Samsung was again sticking with 45W wired charging speeds. Other confirmed features included Bluetooth, dual-band Wi-Fi, 5G connectivity, GNSS, and NFC.</p><p>As for the Galaxy S25 Plus, there wasn’t anything really of note here, as it features the “same connectivity specifications as its Ultra sibling.” This includes the 45W wired charging speeds, which doesn’t really come as much of a surprise.</p><p>There was one more surprise, but it was with the “regular” Galaxy S25, and it’s not great. According to the FCC certification, the entry-level flagship would be limited to 9W wireless charging, a downgrade from the 15W speeds found on the Galaxy S24.</p>
<p>By this point, we had a pretty good idea of what the Galaxy S25 lineup is going to offer in terms of design. However, there’s only been a bit of speculation as to the performance of Samsung’s 2025 flagship devices.</p><p>When different S25 models began appearing in benchmarking apps like Geekbench, we assumed that it was reliant on an unannounced Snapdragon 8 Gen 4. However, this really just turned out to be the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which Qualcomm debuted in late October. <br><br>In mid-November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-samsung-galaxy-s25-will-be-exclusively-powered-by-snapdragon-8-elite-leaker-claims"><u>leaks and rumors</u></a> began suggesting that not only would all three models be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but that this would also apply to global units. Previously, Samsung released its Qualcomm-powered flagship phones in North America and a few other regions, while the rest of the world got Exynos chips.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ" name="Galaxy-S25-Ultra-renders-leak-02.jpg" alt="Galaxy S25 Ultra renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98HWPjmm9qdD2aBRcKnpVJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even before that, the Galaxy S25 Ultra made an appearance on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-with-snapdragon-8-gen-4-hits-benchmark"><u>Geekbench</u></a>, powered by Qualcomm’s latest SoC. The benchmark results showed that the S25 Ultra with 12GB of RAM managed a Single-Core score of 3069, along with a Multi-Core Score of 9080.</p><p>What was a bit surprising was that the OnePlus 13 actually outscored the Galaxy S25 Ultra with scores of 3,236 and 10,049. That might seem disappointing until you see that the S24 Ultra offered scores of 2,308 and 7,283. Needless to say, the Snapdragon 8 Elite offers an incredible boost in performance over its predecessor.</p>
<p>Speaking of performance, there’s a pretty good chance that the Galaxy S25 Ultra might have a gaming advantage over some of the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-likely-to-have-new-game-assist-feature"><u>leaked screenshot</u></a> seemingly revealed that Game Assist will get an upgrade, as one of the bullet points says “Upscaling lets you play games limited to 60Hz at 120Hz.”</p><p>Apparently, this is possible thanks to the Galaxy S25 making use of “Qualcomm’s AFME 2.0 (Adreno Frame Motion Engine) technology, which boosts game performance through frame interpolation.” Essentially meaning that you’ll be able to enjoy upscaled games without sacrificing performance or battery life.</p>
<p>Good morning AC Fam! We're just over 24 hours away from the event tomorrow! <br><br>We thought we’d be kicking off today by talking more about the trio of Galaxy S25 devices expected at Unpacked. However, just yesterday, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-slim-region-availability-leak"><u>another leak</u></a> cropped up that suggests Samsung might not actually release the Galaxy S25 Slim in the U.S. Instead, it appears that despite reportedly coming to at least 39 regions, the U.S. is not included on the list.</p><p>It’s unclear why this might be the case, but the latest leak does corroborate some previous rumors suggesting the U.S. would be left out. On one hand, Samsung probably doesn’t want to upset the “status quo” too much. On the other hand, it would have been cool to see a slimmer Galaxy S25 model, especially if the rumors were true about Apple releasing a slimmer iPhone.</p>
<p>Things haven’t been the same for Samsung ever since the Galaxy Note 7 battery catastrophe. While other OEMs continue to push the limits of charging speeds on smartphones, Samsung rarely ever introduces substantial improvements. For the most part, it does seem that this trend will continue with the Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>We hoped this would change with the Qi2 wireless charging standard announcement. However, none of Samsung’s 2024 phones included Qi2 charging, but it appears that won’t be the case with the Galaxy S25 series. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-tipped-to-have-qi2-wireless-charging-case"><u>it is rumored</u></a> that Samsung will make its 2025 flagship lineup Qi2-compatible as long as you purchase a separate case.</p><p>Samsung again is opting against making any changes to the internals related to charging, despite some of the benefits that Qi2 brings. Instead, if you want to enjoy things like MagSafe accessories and magnetic charging, then you’ll supposedly need to buy the case separately.</p>
<p>It turns out that Santa forgot a present for everyone, and instead delivered it on the day after Christmas by way of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-lineup-looks-more-and-more-like-the-iphone"><u>Dbrand</u></a>. The popular phone skin and case maker opened pre-orders for Galaxy S25 accessories, including skins, cases, and even screen protectors.</p><p>In doing so, Dbrand provided further confirmation of the expected design of the Galaxy S25 series. Seeing as there were rumbles that Samsung might be looking to alter the rear camera design, this won’t be the case. We also were able to essentially compare high-resolution graphics of the Galaxy S25 Ultra next to the S24 Ultra, confirming the rounded corners and flattened edges.</p>
<p>One of the last leaks in 2024 revealed that Samsung might be introducing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s25-series-could-borrow-this-safety-feature-from-apple-and-google"><u>car crash detection</u></a> in the Galaxy S25 Ultra. This came in the form of “leaked code strings,” which mention a “Car Crash Detect Wakeup sensor.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Samsung has already been including the necessary sensors in its phones, but the feature has yet to be made available. Instead, the company has fallen behind both Google and Apple, for one reason or another. Notably, if Car Crash Detection does come to the Galaxy S25 series, it seemingly will only be available on the Ultra model.</p>
<p>It was only a few hours into the New Year, but that didn’t stop the Galaxy S25 Ultra from making an appearance on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-use-an-overclocked-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-in-the-galaxy-s25-series"><u>Geekbench</u></a>. These specific results were from the international model, and even the scores fell short of expectations.</p><p>More importantly, this lent further credence to the rumors that Samsung would rely on a Snapdragon 8 Elite “for Galaxy.” What made this apparent was that two of the cores were clocked higher compared to the “regular” Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p>
<p>After seeing how much focus was put on various AI features on mobile devices in 2024, we expect things to ramp up even more in 2025. The Galaxy S25 series will be one of the first to lead the charge, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/your-galaxy-s25-purchase-could-get-you-free-gemini-advanced-access"><u>one rumor suggesting</u></a> that Samsung and Google will include Gemini Advanced for free.</p><p>There is expected to be a “catch” as the duration of the free trial wil depend on which Galaxy S25 model you decide to purchase. So if you opt for the standard S25, it’s said that three months will be included. This gets bumped up to six months with the Galaxy S25 Plus, and a full year when buying the S25 Ultra.</p>
<p>The first week of the year was when the rumors and leaks really started to pick up, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-and-ultra-are-rocking-blue-hues-and-magsafe-inspired-cases-in-fresh-leak"><u>further confirmation</u></a> was provided regarding the price, processor, and color options. It started with Gizmochina receiving images of the Galaxy S25 and S25 Ultra using Spigen Crystal Flex cases. More importantly, these images gave us a glimpse at the blue color options for these models.</p><p>That same day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1875536907989303781"><u>@ishanagarwal24</u></a> claimed that the European S25 series will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy. Plus, Agarwal revealed the price of the Galaxy S25 with 512GB of storage will come in at €1,079.</p><p>Lastly, it was suggested that Samsung would include 12GB of RAM on all three versions. Previously, the Plus and Ultra models would feature more RAM, with the entry-level device being equipped with a bit less.</p>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s24-ultra/buy/galaxy-s24-ultra-256gb-unlocked-sm-s928ulbexaa/"><u><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 256GB: </strong></u>$1,299.99<u> </u><u><strong>From $349.99 with trade-in | $799.99 without at Samsung</strong></u></a></p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is swiftly approaching, but if you don’t want to wait, it’s worth noting that Samsung has been dropping an impressive number of<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s24-deals-of-the-month"> <u>Galaxy S24 deals</u></a> lately. For instance, you can grab the powerful Galaxy S24 Ultra directly from the source and save up to $750 with a trade-in. Pair that credit with $200 off select colors and your potential discount increases to $950.</p>
<p>All of the leaks, rumors, and speculation culminated in Samsung officially announcing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025"><u>Galaxy Unpacked</u></a> on January 6. The invitation didn’t reveal anything about the Galaxy S25 lineup, but there will be an obvious focus on AI:</p><p>"The next evolution of Galaxy AI is coming and it’s going to change the way you interact with the world every day. The new Galaxy S series is about to set the bar once again for mobile AI experiences now and into the future."</p>
<p>Just a couple of days later, Qualcomm kind of let the cat out of the bag regarding what processor the S25 will use. On its surface, the official Snapdragon account on x.com <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-seemingly-confirms-the-galaxy-s25-series-will-have-a-snapdragon-8-elite-chip"><u>sharing a post</u></a> from the Samsung Mobile account might seem harmless.</p><p>What this did was essentially remove any possible repeat of what Samsung did with the Galaxy Tab S10 lineup. For reference, the Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are powered by MediaTek chipsets, marking the first deviation from Snapdragon processors in years.</p>
<p>You know you’re getting close to a phone launch when the new wallpapers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/these-are-the-official-samsung-galaxy-s25-wallpapers-leaker-claims"><u>are leaked</u></a>. Max Jambor of AllAboutSamsung shared two high-resolution wallpapers “depicting a stylistic ‘S’ pattern.”</p><p>Although only two wallpapers were shared, it’s possible that each unique Galaxy S25 colorway has a wallpaper that matches the phone’s color. Nevertheless, if you want to make your current phone feel like the Galaxy S25, just download one of the wallpapers and start customizing.</p>
<p>We’re less than 24 hours away from Galaxy Unpacked, but you don’t need to worry about missing out as Samsung is live-streaming the Galaxy S25 unveiling. The event kicks off at 1PM ET over at both Samsung.com and the official Samsung website, so you can follow along with us. <br><br>Android Central’s very own Michael Hicks will be on the ground in San Jose, but the rest of us will be watching with excitement. If you want to learn more about Galaxy Unpacked, along with what else to expect, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect"><u>we’ve got you covered</u></a>.</p>
<p>Pivoting back to the leaks and rumors, we’re particularly interested in seeing whether Samsung will make any changes to the camera system. Thanks to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-low-light-video-improvements"><u>IceUniverse</u></a>, it seems that three out of the four cameras will remain the same. However, IceUniverse claims that there will be a new 50MP telephoto entering the mix, offering a 5x optical zoom.</p><p>Not only that, but they continue on, stating that the “S25 Ultra has improved the quality of night video.” It appears that these improvements will be reliant on the Snapdragon 8 Elite, meaning that there’s a good chance some changes won’t be trickling down to the Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p>
<p>Again keeping with the Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-lacking-features-rumor"><u>another rumor surfaced</u></a> suggesting Samsung would be removing the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) capabilities from its latest S Pen. In doing so, features like Air Actions and the ability to use the S Pen as a remote shutter would no longer be available.</p><p>Unfortunately, the rumor didn’t reveal any specific reasons as to why Samsung would make such a decision. Others opined that it could be a way for Samsung to cut down on costs, which could be the case if the company were to keep pricing the same with the latest models. Something else worth noting is that removing BLE from the S Pen could provide an additional “15 to 20 minutes” of battery life to the S25 Ultra.</p>
<p>Frankly, we couldn’t believe it took until the second week of January before someone leaked the entire spec sheet for all three models. Yet here we are, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak"><u>@OnLeaks and Android Headlines</u></a> revealed everything there is to know about the entire Galaxy S25 lineup.</p><p>We won’t list out all of the specifics here, but this massive leak corroborated much of what had been leaked. This includes the standard Galaxy S25 being upgraded with 12GB of RAM, along with the 50MP 5x telephoto lens coming to the S25 Ultra. By now, the only thing that we were missing was pricing and availability.</p>
<p>Actual specs only tell a portion of the story when it comes to new phones being released. A lot of what makes a phone actually good is when the hardware and software work together to provide an excellent experience. So while @OnLeaks might have spilled the beans from the spec basket, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-ultra-video-recording-ai-features-leak"><u>tipster Ahmed Qwaider</u></a> filled in some more of the gaps about some of the S25 Ultra’s potential features.</p><p>Qwaider explained that Samsung will be leaning heavily on AI for some of its new camera features, including one called “Auto Eraser.” Considering that Samsung phones already offer a Magic Eraser-like feature, this leak suggests it will let you “remove annoying sounds in the video.”</p><p><br>Not only that, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra is really shaping up to be <em>the</em> phone for professionals, as Samsung Qwaider goes on to claim that it will be able to record “Log” video. The simplest comparison that I can make is that recording Log video is equivalent to taking pictures in RAW. The end goal is to give the photographer more control when editing, hoping to provide pictures and videos that are more true to life.</p>
<p>When you consider how closely Samsung and Google work together, one can’t help but wonder if Bixby will ever just kick the bucket for good. Gemini is taking over everywhere, including Samsung’s own devices, yet Bixby just keeps hanging around.</p><p>A little over a week ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-potential-bixby-upgrade-unpacked-teaser"><u>Samsung published</u></a> a short video teaser with the title “A true AI companion is coming.” The clip is only 17 seconds long, so there’s really not much to dissect here. However, the only mention of anything is the Galaxy AI logo appearing on screen, with no sign of either Bixby or Gemini.</p><p>What the video does do is suggest that you’ll be able to string together several requests when using Galaxy AI. If this comes to fruition, it would open the door to so many possibilities, adding fuel to the fire of excitement as we near Galaxy Unpacked.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Smart rings took the tech world by storm last year, but they're still relatively niche in terms of global sales. Samsung aside, most smart ring brands are fledgling startups, all trying to make a name for themselves in a Wild West industry. There's no template for the "right" way to make smart rings.</p><p>So it's no surprise that we saw a wide range of smart ring solutions at CES 2025, showing brands like Ultrahuman, Circular, and Evie throwing their darts at the board and seeing what will stick with consumers.</p><p>We interviewed several smart ring CEOs around CES, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-ceo-tom-hale-interview">Oura's Tom Hale</a>, and got some valuable insights into how they hope to rebrand smart rings, whether it be medical tracking, AI insights, or luxury jewelry. And it'll be fascinating to see which angle pays off.</p>
<h2 id="proactive-ai-insights-into-bodily-trends-2">Proactive AI insights into bodily trends</h2>
<p>Smart rings collect a ton of information on your sleep quality and heart rate, with generic explanations for why you might get a bad score. Movano Health, which sells the petite Evie smart ring for women, is looking to use "EvieAI" to improve the actionable insights you get from your data.</p><p>Announced at CES 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/movano-health-launches-evieai-virtual-wellness-assistant-302344841.html">EvieAI Virtual Wellness Assistant</a> "generates clear and concise answers based on articles that have been published in over 100,000 medical journals...to interpret complex user queries about almost any symptom, disease, condition, or procedure."</p><p>CEO John Mastrototaro, whom we interviewed about the announcement, explained that because the AI can "only respond with what it knows" from "validated medical information," cross-references with sources like Mayo Clinic for the best answers — while ignoring any non-medical questions.</p><p>He also promised that your questions will remain private, with no information sent back to Movano Health to be sold to advertisers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9LfgbVBDBkvtudBtXo9HrA" name="EvieAI-beta-conversation-example" alt="Three phone screenshots showing a hypothetical conversation with the EvieAI beta chatbot about a woman's perimenopausal symptoms." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9LfgbVBDBkvtudBtXo9HrA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Movano Health)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this initial version of EvieAI is a more generic kind of chatbot search engine for medical info, the company promises that future EvieAI responses will be "personalized based on users' own health metrics, including heart rate, blood oxygen, menstrual cycle information, skin temperature variability, sleep, exercise, and mood."</p><p>This is something that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> can already do to some extent with its AI chatbot, and it's that version of EvieAI that sounds the most promising for the future of smart rings, where an AI is "looking at all that data, and if it sees something changing in your trends...it could bring that to your attention," explained Mastrototaro.</p><p>Many of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">best smart rings</a> call attention to negative trends, but a medically-focused AI chatbot could, in theory, provide more personalized and specialized insights into that data than what's currently available. Whether EvieAI can deliver "99.9% accurate" data on the strength of its sources, as Mastrototaro suggests, will be worth investigating.</p>
<h2 id="transitioning-from-wellness-to-health-tracking-2">Transitioning from 'wellness' to 'health' tracking</h2>
<p>One of the biggest CES smart ring announcements was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a>. While the original Circular Ring was thin and flat-edged with a relatively short battery life, the Ring 2 has a more traditional rounded ring shape, an 8-day battery life, and an "FDA-approved" ECG sensor to actively detect possible AFib, tachycardia, and brachycardia.</p><p>"All of these [smart ring] brands compete for something very similar, and it's very hard for consumers to differentiate when we're all offering the same thing," explained Circular CEO Amaury Kosman during a CES interview. Transitioning from traditional "wellness" features like sleep and stress to actual health and medical information is how they plan to stand out from the crowd and attract B2B sales.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi" name="Circular-Ring-2-press-photo-rose-gold" alt="A press photo of the rose gold Circular Ring 2 sitting on a rose petal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9w2htTFGLvveCDTcoEyPWi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Circular)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding the ECG meant abandoning Circular's trademark haptics for notifications and alarms, but Kosman sees medical accuracy as the priority until they can fit both in one ring.</p><p>Circular wants to turn its smart rings into an at-home alternative for "expensive" and "invasive" medical checks at the doctor's office, giving you actionable information so you're armed with knowledge <em>before</em> you go to the doctor. ECGs are the start, Kosman says, with future features like "blood pressure" and passive AFib detection being worked on.</p><p>While many smartwatches have FDA-approved AFib detection, most stop there, only promising a "wellness" check-in area like blood oxygen. Smart rings, which can promise a more exact fit on your finger, seem to be pivoting to deliver FDA approval in more areas; case in point, Movano Health got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/movano-health-receives-fda-clearance-for-eviemed-ring-302319677.html">FDA approval for its pulse oximeter</a> last December. Mastrototano, too, promises the Evie Ring will be a "clinical-grade device for B2B channels."</p><p>In other words, even if consumers only see smart rings as a niche novelty for now, that might change if doctors recommend at-risk patients buy smart rings for accurate monitoring in place of more expensive and cumbersome equipment. Medical companies have considerably more reach and marketing than these small smart ring startups; if they get invested in rings, that could change public perception of them.</p>
<h2 id="attracting-the-luxury-crowd-2">Attracting the luxury crowd</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DFzyJyWurTpCRkvsgARD5c" name="Ultrahuman-Rare-Desert-Rose-press-photo" alt="A photo of a model masked in shadow with her hand stylistically lit, highlighting the Ultrahuman Rare Desert Rose smart ring on her index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFzyJyWurTpCRkvsgARD5c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman took yet another rebranding tack at CES when it announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">Ultrahuman Rare</a>. It's a £1,499 smart ring made of either 18k gold or 95% platinum, while still offering the same health and fitness tools as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>.</p><p>"What sets the Rare apart...is the complex engineering that goes into making a robust yet aesthetic form factor out of gold, platinum, and rose gold," Ultrahuman explained in its announcement.</p><p>Ultrahuman isn't a skin-deep kind of company; it announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">PowerPlugs</a> last year as a way to expand what the Ring Air can track, and in 2025 revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision/">Blood Vision</a> gambit to connect your ring wellness data with your blood markers for more exact information. So, its way forward isn't <em>just</em> about turning smart rings into attractive jewelry.</p><p>Still, even if the Ultrahuman Rare has very limited sales, we see aesthetics as a vital path forward for smart rings, as they all tend to be so thick and similar to one another. They stand out compared to the skinny, rounded rings that most people wear, and that can limit their reach with consumers.</p><p>This shows that if smart ring brands go beyond the tech space and make them seem attractive luxury items to mainstream consumers, that could be yet another path for them to grow beyond their current niche. Jewelers and department stores have far more advertising reach and clout than little-known tech brands.</p>

<p>TikTok is officially shutting down in the U.S. The app is banned as of Sunday, Jan. 19, 2025, when a law enacting the ban will take effect. Multiple pop-up messages began appearing for users of the TikTok app for Android in the U.S. throughout the night of Saturday, Jan. 18, just ahead of the impending ban. While the latest message forces TikTok to become completely unavailable, it does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-can-save-tiktok-from-united-states-ban">give hope that service could be restored quickly</a>.</p><p>"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now," the latest message reads, as shown in a screenshot that appeared for Android Central below. "A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now."</p><p>Over the last few days, there have been reports concerning how the TikTok ban would be impacted by the looming transition of presidential power in the U.S. Outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden declined to enforce the ban, as reported by multiple outlets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/01/17/tiktok-ban-biden-wont-enforce-decision-trump/77773281007/" target="_blank">USA Today</a>. That leaves the fate of the TikTok ban in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Monday, Jan. 20.</p><p>Recent reports have indicated that Trump will consider giving TikTok an extension in the hopes that it will sell the U.S. part of its business. Lawmakers in the country have maintained that their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">preference is to divest TikTok from ByteDance</a>, not shut it down. They argue that TikTok's current ownership poses a national security threat because Chinese laws could theoretically force ByteDance to hand over U.S. user data to the government if requested.</p>

<p>The most recent notification hints at which way Trump may be leaning. "We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office," the notification reads. "Please stay tuned!"</p><p>For now, the notification provides buttons for <strong>Learn more</strong> and <strong>Close app</strong>. TikTok is officially offline for U.S. users and will stay that way until, if, and when the company and the federal government can figure out a way to move forward. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/oracle-prepares-to-start-shutting-tiktok-servers-saturday-night" target="_blank">The Information</a>, TikTok's U.S. cloud servers are hosted by Oracle, which will keep the platform's servers powered down until it is definitively clear that it is lawfully permitted to operate in the country.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Look, there's no shortage of choices if you're looking to upgrade your earbuds, and there's a new option that's intriguing. Korea-based Astell&Kern launched the AK UW100MKII at the end of 2023, and they're now making their way to India. The lengthy wait comes with a distinct advantage though, as the earbuds are now being sold at a massive discount. <br><br>While the earbuds debuted for $299, they're now on sale in India for just ₹4,999 ($58) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.headphonezone.in/products/astell-kern-ak-uw100mkii">at Headphone Zone</a>, and that's a stellar value. Astell&Kern don't sell the UW100MKII in other regions any longer, so it's entirely likely that the brand is moving unsold inventory to India and offering it at a discount.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nVHWfonYfLgP4PQVasYXgU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVHWfonYfLgP4PQVasYXgU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Regardless of the reason, the UW100MKII are among the most intriguing earbuds in the budget category, and the focus on high-resolution sound combined with a great built-in DAC allow it to stand out. The design is distinctive in its own right; the UW100MKII come in a rather bulky case with a hexagonal design, and while it is still pocketable, it is much bigger than what you get with most mainstream audio brands. <br><br>It's not just the case that's bulky either — the UW100MKII have a sizeable shell that makes them bigger than just about every other earbuds I used recently. You get a hexagonal design on the face plate as well, alongside a stylized AK logo. The brand says it redesigned the sound chamber to deliver a cleaner sound, and while that is evident when using the earbuds, they protrude from the ear quite a bit.</p>

<p>The bulky design means I never quite got a decent fit, and even doing routine tasks like walking around the house doing chores led to an earbud dislodging. Clearly, these aren't meant for exercising, so if you need a new pair of earbuds that you can take to the gym, these aren't it. There is IPX4 ingress protection, but the issues with the fit prevent the UW100MKII from bring usable in this regard. <br><br>You miss out on ANC as well, and that's understandable when you consider the context of where these earbuds are meant to be used. The fit means that these are meant to be used indoors, and I wouldn't recommend using them while traveling, much less involving any activity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PXBPCNTm6MuE7YqnY4fDcU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PXBPCNTm6MuE7YqnY4fDcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for connectivity, the earbuds use Bluetooth 5.2, and you get fast pair, giving you the ability to link the buds with your Google account, making it a breeze to connect when switching devices — as I do often. The standout addition is AptX Adaptive; it allows you to stream high-res music over Bluetooth, and it's a welcome inclusion.<br><br>The UW100MKII include a Knowles balanced armature driver, so if you've used IEMs that had these drivers in the past, you'll be familiar with the sound signature. It's clear that Astell&Kern wanted to deliver a neutral sound without exaggerating any part of the frequency, and that makes the UW100MKII sound quite different to just about every other option around. You also get an AKM AK4332ECB DAC, and it is a great pairing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ETmcuc6qFrC9yWLJQ3Y9oU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ETmcuc6qFrC9yWLJQ3Y9oU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the sound, the bass is limited, and you just don't get the same level of energy as other earbuds in this category. The defining characteristic of most wireless earbuds is a rumbling bass that lends itself well to diverse genres, and the UW100MKII miss out on that — the tuning is in line with what you get on IEMs, and while you don't get the same vibrancy, there is good resolution. <br><br>The UW100MKII deliver clean mids with a good vocal presentation, and the treble has decent extension without sibilance. There's no distortion or hiss, and I didn't have any issues with the soundstage after a month of use. The AK Control app is available on Android (you need to have a device with Android 15), and it lets you tweak the sound profile, adjust the DAC settings, and tune ambient noise control. I didn't see any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EuHVPbcBM4vLddrDfZmppU" name="AK UW100 MKII" alt="AK UW100 MKII earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuHVPbcBM4vLddrDfZmppU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a bass-focused mode that adds a little bit of exuberance to the low-end, but it isn't on the same level as most earbuds. That said, when it comes to the technicalities of the sound itself, the UW100MKII do a fantastic job. I didn't see any issues with battery life either, with the earbuds managing to last six hours between charges. While I didn't have issues with connectivity, the right earbud didn't always sit flush in the case, so it ended up running out of charge earlier. <br><br>So should you buy these earbuds? If you need a sound signature that's similar to IEMs and want a neutral tuning, then yes, the UW100MKII are a good choice. But if you need an easier fit, better bass, and water resistance, I'd recommend getting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds 3</a> instead.</p>

<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 comes in 38mm and 42mm case sizes. Both ship in Black or Pearl White, while only the 38mm has Blue and Sand color options. All of them ship with a fluoroelastomer band; Withings sells other Leather, Premium Sport, and Metal options that cost anywhere from $39 to $89 each.</p><p>All Withings ScanWatch 2 models cost $349.95. It comes with a three-month subscription to Withings Plus, which shows a Health Improvement Score, Cardio Check-Up, and unique recipes and workouts. After the free trial, it costs $9.95/month or $99.95/year.</p><p>Withings has also released the ScanWatch Brilliant and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-nova-announced">ScanWatch Nova</a> for $599; both are essentially classier siblings of the ScanWatch 2. They have the same HealthSense Gen 3 sensor suite, stainless steel 316L case, 0.63-inch OLED cutout display, prolonged battery life, and general health, sleep, and activity insights. The Nova has 10ATM resistance and a better anti-reflective coating for water sports, while the Brilliant has a Titanium bezel and special steel hands.</p><p>Since you're looking at a hybrid watch for style over smarts, you may choose the Brilliant or Nova over the default ScanWatch 2, knowing the experience we outline below will be the same for you.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NyMZUYpUaCoF2JbVbyTRum" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-1" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on a wrist" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NyMZUYpUaCoF2JbVbyTRum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Off the bat, this is a gorgeous watch. The circular stainless steel case and sapphire glass give the watch a timeless look, one that many smartwatches try to emulate with varying success. Of course, a big part of this is the fact that this is mostly a standard watch with no touch screen, physical watch hands, and a rotating crown (more on that later). Anyone looking at the ScanWatch 2 wouldn’t think that this does anything but tell time.</p><p>I’ve actually gotten quite a few compliments on the watch, something that rarely happens when I wear my admittedly very good-looking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or even a Galaxy Watch. And when Michael showed non-techy family members over a dozen smartwatches over the holidays, nearly all of them picked the ScanWatch 2 as their favorite, with some saying it's the only one they'd ever wear.</p><p>Unlike a "normal" watch, the ScanWatch 2 has a small circular cutout at the top for a basic, monocolor display. Given its small size, interactions are quite limited, but Withings does a fairly good job of keeping things concise enough to discern individual settings.</p><p>Watch hands cover up the display depending on the time, but since there's no always-on display setting, it doesn't matter; the hands automatically move aside if you interact with the crown to scroll through the menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="x2pVAYxwd6syDuRZbh3F8k" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-7" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 in hand with the display on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2pVAYxwd6syDuRZbh3F8k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3807" height="2141" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps the best part about using the display is the haptic feedback you get when you scroll to another option. It’s quite subtle, but it makes me think about the haptics on the Pixel Watch 3 and reminds me just how important good haptics are.</p><p>Cycling through the menu presents you with up to 14 customizable options, which can be changed in the app. This includes steps, body temperature, ECG, SpO2, and more. Given how small the display is, Withings makes it so that you don’t have to interact with various levels of submenus in each option, which works in its favor. In fact, only a few options have submenus, with most just there to display data like steps or heart rate without you needing to do anything.</p><p>You also have the option to set a shortcut when you press and hold the crown, which I like to set to workouts since it’s about the only thing I do with the ScanWatch 2 aside from checking the time. Anything especially complicated is relegated to the app, with the extra screen space and easier controls.</p>

<p>This is not a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a> by any means. There are some workout options in the watch, which you can also customize in the app, but the Withings ScanWatch 2 is more of a passive health watch than anything, with automatic workout detection for a few mainstream activities and manual workout starts in the app. And it requires your phone on hand for connected GPS.</p><p>After a run, Withings will show an interesting baseline of data, including distance, pace, calories, elevation, heart rate zones, body temperature changes, and temp zones. The last two are especially rare, outside of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/core-body-temperature-sensor-thermal-load">expensive body temp sensors</a>, giving you a unique look at your level of effort.</p><p>There's a lot of missing data for athletes that we'll discuss in the next section, but at the very least, the heart rate average is fairly accurate for normal workouts, coming within 1 bpm of a heart rate strap during a run. During another run, it randomly showed a heart rate of 30 bpm above Michael's actual rate for a couple of minutes at the start but then auto-corrected to the correct rate.</p>

<p>The ScanWatch 2's main function — aside from health tracking and basic fitness — is to show phone notifications. Withings lets you customize which apps can buzz your wrist, which fits with the hybrid smartwatch theme of limiting them to important information. The display is activated by gesture and is subtle enough that you'll look as if you're just checking the time.</p><p>Notifications show a tiny app icon with the text flowing quickly underneath in a single-file line; the speed is important so you're not stuck standing there for too long, waiting for information that would all show instantly on a full-screen AMOLED. You can see in the photos above how the Slack notification "Derrek Lee: Sure thing, how's this?" would require at least three photos to show all the text. Thankfully, notifications scroll past multiple times in case you miss anything.</p><p>If you receive multiple messages from the same app, the ScanWatch 2 gives up and shows the app icon and nothing else. While you might wish for more information, it's kind of an effective way of telling the user they've already missed information and should pull out their phone.</p>

<p>The Withings app experience is about as simple as the watch itself. It uses the same app as Withings’ other products, meaning you can manage all your devices in one space, something that comes in handy. I like that I can view my steps and activities in the same place as the weight measurement data from my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/withings-body-cardio-review">Withings Body Cardio</a> scale, giving me a more comprehensive view of my health from within the same family of devices. Any blank spots can be filled by other devices via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> or individual app connections to partner apps like Google Fit, MyFitnessPal, Strava, and more.</p><p>If you're picking up the ScanWatch 2, then you'll love its battery life. Withings says the watch should last up to 30 days on a single charge, which feels accurate. I haven’t been able to reach that mark only because I track multiple workouts per week while wearing the watch. Still, I average two or three weeks on a single charge, and I often forget that I even need to charge the watch. Even when the battery reaches 0%, it’ll still be able to track your sleep and steps for some time, which is pretty great.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4hfPJZkEe46o3FFwnb2vH5" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-settings" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on the author's wrist, showing the Settings menu on the small OLED screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4hfPJZkEe46o3FFwnb2vH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 is trying to be as passive as possible, which is understandable given its small display. Other hybrid watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a> give you much more display space for clearer information but also tend to be much shorter-lived. Withings prioritizes battery life and subtlety, but it does limit the smarts.</p><p>While the watch keeps menus basic, navigation can still be a bit of a pain, especially when you have most of the menu options enabled. I often find myself scrolling for longer than I would like to get to a specific menu option, and if you want to exit out of a submenu, you’ll have to scroll all the way up and select the back button, which just feels cumbersome.</p><p>Additionally, if you’re in a submenu and go a short period without interacting with the display, it’ll go back to the clock face. You’ll need to use the app to cut some unnecessary options and minimize scrolling.</p><p>While you're at it, you may also want to use this time to manage your notifications, as the ScanWatch 2 is pretty hit-or-miss when it comes to displaying them. Sometimes, the watch misses them entirely; other times, it only shows them after I've already opened the message on my phone, which defeats the purpose.</p><p>While I love the subtle crown haptics, Withings cranked up the vibration for notifications and phone calls to a rather shocking level. It's frankly annoying, to the point that I often leave the watch in Do Not Disturb. Wear OS and Apple Watches let you adjust the vibration strength, but Withings' setting menu is a bit too barebones. At least you never have to worry about sleeping through an alarm!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-3" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open to a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I said previously, the ScanWatch 2 isn’t really a fitness watch, which is pretty evident by its design. So, while you’ll get some workout options to choose from, some that I would frequently use just aren’t there, leaving me to have to choose “Other” or “Fitness” when I’m doing something fairly common, like HIIT. There are still plenty of workout options available, but that one is an annoying omission for me.</p><p>As for the more common workout options like running, you miss out on data that's common on other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a> like running form, running power, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>. Its heart rate data lacks subtlety, too, lumping most of your effort into either "moderate" or "intense."</p><p>I also don’t like that there isn’t a way to export my individual workout data, at least not in any way that’s obvious to me. Sure, I can edit workout data like the type, intensity, and duration, but once it’s logged, the only way I can share it is via an image, which is essentially a screenshot of the workout summary. Syncing the app with Strava also doesn't help, as it only shares the workout type and duration, while my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin Venu 3</a> will provide heart rate data, location, and just about everything I would want to include in a workout summary.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XhvKNFDMJ7YA2gxoDu3cM5" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-ECG" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 on the author's wrist, showing the ECG widget on the small OLED screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XhvKNFDMJ7YA2gxoDu3cM5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Withings ScanWatch 2 has a fairly comprehensive list of health metrics that it tracks, from heart health and blood oxygen to menstrual cycle phases. It also has a few features — overnight HRV, respiratory rate, and awake temperature zones — that are <em>still</em> "coming soon," even though we delayed our review for so long.</p><p>More importantly, I’m not crazy about the sleep tracking. To start, the ScanWatch 2 isn't the lightest watch on the block, with the 42mm size weighing nearly as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. This makes it rather uncomfortable to wear to bed, something we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">find with most smartwatches</a> but is particularly troublesome with the ScanWatch 2.</p><p>Sometimes, the watch will be pretty decent, but oftentimes, it will omit large portions of my sleep. I tend to wake up in the middle of the night, and I’ll get up for a minute or two to use the restroom or grab a drink before falling back asleep. While my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> will continue to track my sleep, the ScanWatch 2 will seemingly miss hours' worth of sleep tracking, which puzzles me.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wGmFutBDrLW6zzSbrGNKpm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-4" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGmFutBDrLW6zzSbrGNKpm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Furthermore, the app seemingly prioritizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> sleep data over the ScanWatch data, which I find odd. The plus side is that the data is from my Oura Ring 4, so at least it’s logging the more accurate data, but it’s still interesting that Withings wouldn’t prioritize its own device over outside data.</p><p>Speaking of the app, Withings really wants you to buy into its Withings Plus subscription, which will provide things like a Health improvement score, a library of workouts and recipes with recommended daily missions, and health insights that let you view your trends. While I’m not fully against subscriptions, Withings Plus just doesn’t feel quite worth the $9.95 monthly price tag, especially when Oura’s is only $5.99 per month and other smartwatch OEMs don’t require a subscription at all for this data. Make it make sense, Withings!</p><p>It’s also a good thing the ScanWatch 2 has such a long battery life because the rather cumbersome charger takes about two hours to fully recharge the watch.</p>

<p>Choosing a hybrid watch comes down to your personal preferences on style and how much health info or fitness tech you want out of your watch.</p><p>If you really only need the <em>basics</em> of health data to go with your notifications, the Withings ScanWatch Light will save you $100 compared to the ScanWatch 2. In exchange, you lose ECGs, skin temperature, elevation tracking, and blood oxygen, while keeping a similar steel design and dependable battery life.</p><p>Garmin makes popular hybrid or fashion models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Vivomove Trend</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-crossover-review">Instinct Crossover</a>, and Lily 2 that give you data like heart rate, stress, and blood oxygen, along with connected GPS and useful training insights without a subscription. Only the Vivomove series is truly "stylish" in our books, and it has much shorter battery life than the ScanWatch 2, plus no ECG or skin temperature; we do appreciate that its grayscale screen is a little larger, so it displays more information. The Instinct Crossover will appeal to fans of rugged Casio-type watches, not classic watches.</p><p>Unfortunately, it's hard to find any <em>smarter</em> hybrid watches with better notifications or apps than Withings or Garmin. Fossil made decent hybrid models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fossil-gen-6-hybrid-wellness-edition-review">Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition</a>, but Fossil has abandoned the platform. Citizen still sells the CZ Smart Hybrid with Wear OS 3, but we haven't tested it for ourselves and it's unlikely Citizen will ever update to the later versions.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a classy-looking "smartwatch."</li><li>You want a "smartwatch" with minimal distractions.</li><li>You want basic health and fitness tracking.</li><li>You own a Withings scale and love the app already.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want comprehensive fitness tracking.</li><li>You're looking for a more traditional smartwatch experience with a touchscreen and full-screen interactions.</li><li>You don't own any other Withings products.</li></ul>
<p>There's no doubt that the ScanWatch 2 is a beautiful piece of hardware. While I like the look of the Pixel Watch 3, the ScanWatch 2 has a classic yet understated design that goes well with most outfits. Plus, with such a long battery life, it feels more like a regular watch with some smart tricks to keep you on top of your health and wellness.</p><p>However, as a hybrid smartwatch, I'm not sure the ScanWatch 2 quite hits the mark, feeling more "watch" than "smart." The minimal display keeps things rather passive, which buyers may prefer, but interacting with the watch can be cumbersome at worst and unreliable at best. Unless you are subscribed to Withings Plus or own any other Withings devices, the watch may leave you wanting more out of your data, including the type of insights you can find on other devices for less money or even free.</p><p>If the ScanWatch 2 was priced about $50-$100 less, I would maybe recommend getting one. But right now, it doesn't really do much to move hybrid smartwatches forward in any meaningful way, and you'd be better off spending your $349 on the latest Pixel Watch or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> if you want passive tracking.</p><p>That said, both Michael and I skew much more towards the "tech" and "fitness" side of smartwatches, which skews our perspective on what we want. If your main priority is classic style, with health tracking and notifications as secondary concerns, then the ScanWatch 2 might be right up your alley.</p>

<p>I was recently asked to give some reasons why someone might want to move from iOS to Android, under the pretense that this hypothetical person hadn't used Android in over 10 years. After sitting and thinking about it for a little while, I provided my responses, but I also came away with a burning question — Is AI really the last frontier?</p><p>It's a question that's been rattling around in my head for the better part of the past year, as I've watched Google, Samsung, Apple, OnePlus, and others, try to find the right balance. OpenAI's ChatGPT is really to blame after it exploded onto the scene <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-one-year-later">back in late 2022</a>. It became so popular so quickly that it forced Google's hand to the point that Gemini was originally called Bard. Like, for months, before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-bard-gemini-rebrand-app-launch">making the correct decision</a> to rebrand it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tndmX2quZgmwDNi5F6GGnn" name="google-bard-pixel-7-pro-samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-1.jpg" alt="Google Bard interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tndmX2quZgmwDNi5F6GGnn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the same time, Apple threw in the towel and just integrated ChatGPT into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone</a>, and it still doesn't do anything to make Siri any better. Samsung's partnership with Google is paying off, as it is leaning heavily on Gemini for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> integrations. Even OnePlus got in the game, also relying on a combination of its own in-house developed AI models, along with Gemini Nano on the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>All of this sounds great, truly. But what can possibly be next?</p><p>There's not much else that can be done in the way of design innovation. We already have flippable clamshells, book-style <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a>, and even bi-folds that everyone is calling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">tri-folds</a>. And while rollable phones haven't really hit the market yet, they might not be far off, as Lenovo announced a rollable laptop that's actually being released later this year.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yvjEqEdx6PbRkoqY8FkXnk" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvjEqEdx6PbRkoqY8FkXnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android is no longer playing catchup to iOS, at least in most regards, and one could even argue that Android is the better platform for everyone. Do you want to tinker? Use Android. Want to keep things simple? Get a Pixel. Looking to replicate the Apple ecosystem? Look no further than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung</a>.</p><p>While I could definitely sit here and nitpick about things on both iOS and Android, that's kind of the point. They're only nitpicks. The landscape is nothing like it used to be, as there's quite a bit of feature parity between the two platforms. No, it's not synchronous, but the days of not being able to perform even the most basic of tasks on one and not the other have disappeared from the rearview mirror.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-03" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So what can possibly be next? I honestly don't think the answer actually lies within smartphones. If I were to make a non-educated guess, the "Next Big Thing" wouldn't actually have anything to do with a smartphone. I think we're heading in a completely different direction, and the most likely end result is going to be a wearable like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta's Ray Ban Smart Glasses</a>.</p><p>Maybe it won't be those specifically, but it has to be something in that ballpark. At the same time, I don't think it will be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">virtual reality</a>, at least not in our day-to-day lives. Maybe VR overtakes console gaming or something, but seeing how popular handhelds are becoming, I doubt even that happens.</p><p>As pointed out by Michael Hicks, Android Central's senior editor of Wearables & AR/VR, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-xr-will-need-to-emulate-wear-os-to-succeed">plenty of potential problems</a> that will need to be remedied with various <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> headsets when they finally hit the market. These are similar issues to the ones that continue to affect smartwatches, such as "battery life, comfortable and stylish designs, accessible controls," amongst others.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-01" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6v9tA3m9Tq5TSncqyvWiG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although Google and Samsung are getting a late jump compared to Meta, that's not necessarily a bad thing. With other companies already releasing options, this gives others the opportunity to learn what mistakes to avoid, in addition to having an idea of "what works" versus what doesn't.</p><p>However, unlike smartphones and other wearables, Android XR has the distinct and unique "advantage" of being the first new platform to arrive in the age of AI. We fully expect Gemini to be everywhere and anywhere that Google can put it, but I also wouldn't be surprised if its functionality is limited for the first year or two.</p><p>This is simply because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> have a limited physical space, and will have a multitude of various sensors and other necessary components just to work. Plus, new platforms and new devices usually mean higher prices as companies try to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-prototypes-2022">recoup the R&D costs</a> in addition to attempting to turn a profit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1050px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.19%;"><img id="scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP" name="google-project-astra-enters-signup-phase" alt="Google's Project Astra lets testers point their cameras at items within its app to receive information about it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/scrkicTkF2C4mLg9diudmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1050" height="527" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No, I don't believe that AI is the final frontier, but I do believe that we're at the "end of the line" in terms of avenues that can be explored in terms of hardware.</p><p>Nothing will be able to replicate or even replace the smartphone for many reasons, but mainly because your phone is the most personal device you have. This is partially why I think we're seeing companies shift focus to implementing AI into the software, as it <em>should</em> make our most personal devices even more personal.</p><p>So, while it may seem like AI is the <em>next</em> frontier, I do believe that there's still room for something new in terms of hardware. Now, it's just up to companies to figure out what that looks like and find ways to implement it in our daily lives.</p>

<h2 id="choose-only-the-best-oneplus-13r-screen-protectors-2">Choose only the best OnePlus 13R screen protectors</h2>
<p>The best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13r-cases">OnePlus 13R cases</a> sometimes come with screen protectors in the box. If you didn't get one, or maybe you were bold enough to forgo a case altogether, you need one of the best OnePlus 13R screen protectors. Screens crack and smash all the time, so better be safe than sorry.</p><p>Most OnePlus 13R screen guards are made of tempered glass, which is a good material for shatter-proofing your phone's display. However, flexible films are often better at scratch resistance as they can heal from minor abrasions. Not to mention, not all glass protectors work smoothly with in-display fingerprint readers. Luckily, this hasn't been reported as an issue by OnePlus 13R users so far.</p><p>Thus, you can rely on a kit like the Anoowkoa 2 Pack OnePlus 13R Screen Protectorto fortify your 13R's frontal region. The brand is very highly rated and its users are mostly satisfied with the quality of the tempered glass screen protectors. What makes it an even better deal overall is the fact that you get two glass camera lens protectors as well. Since these screen guards have undergone the oleophobic treatment, they repel solid and liquid particles such as water droplets, sweat, dust, and fingerprints.</p><p>And if you're really looking to make the most of your coin, take a gander at the Suttkue OnePlus 13R Screen Protector set which comes with a shock-proof clear case. Yes, that's right, the clear case has reinforced edges for high impact absorbtion. This, in addition to two robust 9H tempered glass pieced is an excellent bargain.</p>

<p>This is Android Central's News Weekly, your go-to source for a concise roundup of the week's most significant tech stories. This is where we delve into the top headlines that provide the latest developments and innovations contributing to the digital landscape.</p><p>The countdown to Samsung's Unpacked has begun, and in a week, we will see what this year's models look like. This week, Galaxy S25 leaks came in hot, we got a Moto G launch, the Galaxy Ring just received more updates, Honor Magic 7 Pro launched globally, and the new OnePlus models got their first update.</p>

<p><em><strong>More on these stories in the embedded links below.</strong></em></p><p>We all know too well that the week before a launch is crucial. However, this is also a time when we get to see a plethora of leaks. From device colors to AI powers, we got to see them all building the excitement for some or taking the mystery out for others.</p><p>Evan Blass has been putting out information about the Galaxy S25 series. In the first set of leaks, Blass reportedly sent an email carrying his newsletter, which contained renders of the Galaxy S25 and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-color-rendering-leak-surfaces" target="_blank"> its entire alleged color palette</a>. According to Blass, the S25 Ultra is set to receive four options such as black, white, grayish blue, and gray.</p><p>In another email, Blass sent alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action" target="_blank">official promotional posters</a> from Samsung that painted a picture of how the cameras on these devices will likely appear. The first image shows the two devices, which seem to be the Galaxy<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25"> </a>S25 and S25 Plus models, in deep blue and silver color variants. The image gives us a close-up of the trio's cameras on the back, with black rims surrounding them.</p><p>Additionally, within the image, a new AI feature was spotted that is said to come with the One<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on"> </a>UI<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on"> </a>7. The screen displays an interactive bar at the bottom, dubbed “Now Bar,” with the “Now Brief” prompt visible that reads "Get today's highlight."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So... While everyone's focusing on devices I revealed 5 months ago, today, I'm once again well ahead of the hype by finally bringing you the very 1st look at the #GalaxyS25Slim (360° video + gorgeous 5K renders + dimensions)!😏On behalf of @Smartprix 👉🏻 https://t.co/FPZnEKqNuD pic.twitter.com/HSTloqzYj7<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1879599398625374691">January 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Another device we got to see is the Galaxy S25 Slim. We <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">got a glimpse at renders </a>of the assumed device that were discovered by OnLeaks. The images suggest the device will look a lot like the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus, with rumors suggesting a size closer to the Plus and Ultra with a completely flat display.</p><p>The leaker suggests that the Galaxy S25 Slim will be roughly "1.6mm narrower, 3.8mm shorter, and 1.8mm thinner" than the upcoming S25 Ultra. There are claims that the phone will have the same camera setup as the S25 phones—three cameras: a 200MP primary lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens, and a 50MP ALoP telephoto camera with 3.5x zoom.</p><p>To know more about what to expect at this January's Unpacked event, head to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">our ultimate guide</a>.</p>

The phone is powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, with 8GB of RAM on board. The phone also gets the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with features like audio sharing and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect</a>.</p><p>The device gets a 5,000mAh battery, which Motorola says will enable all-day battery life. The Power 2025 also comes with an 8MP ultrawide camera. What's surprising is that this time, Motorola has managed to achieve the MIL-STD-810H certification and IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13,</a> in its $299 device. This means the phone can withstand being submerged and should be able to hold out when facing high-pressure water jets. The Moto G Power 2025 comes in Slate Gray and  Leaf Green colorways.</p><p>The other model, the Moto G 2025, features a smaller 6.7-inch display and the same Dimensity 6300 chipset. The difference between this and the Power 2025 is the lower 4 or 6GB of RAM and 64 or 128GB of expandable storage (compared to 256GB). The device sports a 2MP macro sensor. The Moto G 2025 gets a 5,000mAh battery and upgraded charging speeds up to 30W when compared to its predecessor. This device is set to come in two colors: Forest Gray and Sapphire Blue. It will be available starting January 30 for $199.</p>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a> now comes in sizes 5-15, adding two larger sizes to its existing ones—14 & 15, in all three colorways, including silver, gold, and black, and will debut on January 22, 2025, alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">upcoming Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>It is also bringing new features to the ring, to start, the mindfulness tracker will be available in the Samsung Health app soon. The new mindfulness section of the app will show a calendar with easy-to-understand, color-coded faces that summarize each day's mood, breathing, and stress levels.</p><p>In the first half of 2025, Samsung will add a new sleep environment report that will use SmartThings-connected devices to add temperature, humidity, air quality, and light intensity to your morning sleep report. Later in the second half of 2025, it will bring another update to the Galaxy Ring that will suggest optimal bedtime and wake-up time based on collected sleep patterns, habits, and conditions.</p><p>Samsung is also expanding its availability in 16 new countries, including Cyprus, Czech, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mauritius, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Zambia.</p>

The brand's high-end flagship is different from the China model that debuted in November 2024. The E.U. model of the Magic 7 Pro has a  6.8-inch screen that comes with a "Natural Light HONOR AI Eye Comfort Display." It uses the same battery technology with a smaller 5,270mAh capacity. The device has third-gen silicon-carbon batteries that provide higher capacities in smaller sizes, allowing the Magic 7 Pro to measure 8.8mm thick. The Honor Magic 7 Pro comes with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> processor.</p><p>When it comes to the camera array, the main Honor Magic 7 Pro camera is a 50MP, f/1.4 to f/2.0 adjustable aperture sensor with optical image stabilization. There's a 200MP periscope telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom and a 50MP wide camera with a 122-degree field-of-view. When it comes to the selfie camera, it sports a 50MP wide camera.</p><p>It's also a very tough phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-phone-makers-want-your-smartphone-to-survive-a-kitchen-nightmare">as Honor demonstrated</a> by preparing food on the phone, sticking it in a dishwasher, dropping it out of a moving ATV, and then running it over with said ATV.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro will be available in the U.K. starting at £1,099.99 and in the rest of Europe for €1,299.99.</p>

The shots taken through both handsets' primary camera and telephoto will start looking better, with color enhancements coming in with the update. The OnePlus 13 and the 13R have a Touch-to-share feature, which now supports iOS devices, making file and photo sharing easier between phones.</p><p>That said, the company says this update is being rolled out in batches, and users could expect to see the update as early as this weekend.</p>

We know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank">Galaxy S25</a> is coming, and that usually means three models ranging from regular to Ultra, but there are also some other variants said to be locked behind some Samsung secret vault.</p><p>One of them is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">Galaxy S25 Slim</a>. It appears to be a "regular"-sized Galaxy S25 that's been put on a diet to slim down even more than the already slim Galaxy S25. What? Why?</p>

<p>A phone is actually a very personal item. It's part fashion choice, part utility, and part comfort. You want a phone that is easy to use, does the things you need it to do, and looks good. We all do.</p><p>With Android, there are thousands of different <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">phones to choose from,</a> so you can find the one that's best for you. I want something easy to carry, cheap, and great at the things I call "smartphone basics," like messaging, email, and organization. I chose a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> and am completely satisfied with it.</p><p>You may want something to play games, has a ton of storage, or comes with a stylus. Go for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-rumored-low-light-video-improvements">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and never look back.</p><p>Both of us will find what we need.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are people out there who think 7mm is too thick and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">want a slimmer phone</a>. I don't know why, but I know those people exist. What I am sure of is that even those people aren't willing to make the compromises to get it with the current state of phone-making technology and they will realize it once they buy into it.</p><p>Until things are miniaturized even more, you have to sacrifice two very important things to get a phone extra slim: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery capacity</a> and durability. Both those things are pretty important.</p><p>Samsung will probably be able to decrease the camera bump with its new prism/lens tech; it places the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed" target="_blank">lenses on the prism</a> instead of in a separate space, making the whole thing shorter, and it is a pretty big deal we will see other phone makers use.</p><p>But that's not going to shave off the thickness of the phone itself. You need room to sandwich a screen assembly, a mainboard, and a battery inside the frame. Current tech isn't going to allow for a thinner screen combo or a thinner board so that means the only thing that can be made smaller is the battery. Smaller batteries mean less time away from the charger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uwjEVyVvrLeTypb7EBkpMF" name="google-pixel-9-45w-charger-01.jpg" alt="Charging the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google's 45W Pixel charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwjEVyVvrLeTypb7EBkpMF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a million excuses why less battery capacity is fine. It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-fast-charging-differences-explained">charges really fast</a> or you can carry around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nivrana-battery-pack-oculus-quest-review">a battery pack</a> are examples. I'm here to tell you that those excuses stink and you shouldn't believe them because I used a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-4-review">Pixel 4</a> for a year. It was a great phone in almost every way — but the battery life sucked. Really sucked.</p><p>A slim phone will also be more fragile and have fewer means of cooling things down. You need room to move heat away from the processor package, and a thinner metal frame isn't as robust as a thicker one. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/post-bendgate-world-apples-word-still-good-enough-most">Bendgate</a> II, anyone?</p><p>In the end, it may not matter because the Galaxy S25 Slim is nothing more than a render. So far. If it <em>is</em> locked away at Samsung HQ waiting to be foisted on the buying public sometime later this year, think long and hard about the trade-off that comes with shaving a few millimeters off a modern smartphone.</p>

<p>Maybe you know exactly which color to buy when getting a new device, or maybe you spend days pondering over the right option. If you can relate to the latter, we're here to help. If not, good for you! This guide isn't for you.</p><p>Choosing which color of a phone to buy can be daunting, especially when you're going to using your expensive investment for a really long time. If you're too overwhelmed, Black Eclipse is a failsafe. However, I always encourage people to make brave decisions.</p><p>The blue vegan leather variant of the OnePlus 13 called Midnight Ocean is a fantastic way to reimagine what a phone's colorway should be. OnePlus didn't just change the coat of paint, but also the texture of this variant. It's the color of your standard pair of blue jeans, making it iconic. The superb leathery texture is hard to compare to the other two options of the OnePlus 13 that sport glass backs. Not only does it look spectacular, but it's also more scratch-resistant than the other options. You could probably use the Midnight Ocean version without a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-cases">OnePlus 13 case</a>, considering the phone's robust ingress protection ratings.</p><p>If you do end up getting the Midnight Ocean variant, please get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-oneplus-13-screen-protectors">screen protector for your OnePlus 13</a>. The display is still made of glass and it's the most vulnerable part of your phone, so you need to reinforce it to keep it fresh in the long run.</p>

<p>All the best OnePlus 13R cases are priced below $20, with the one exception being OnePlus' own first-party phone cover. Despite the relatively high price, the OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic Case is the best overall choice for your mid-range king.</p><p>OnePlus didn't add Qi2 wireless charging to the more affordable OnePlus 13R, but that doesn't mean you can't use magnetic accessories with it. With the OnePlus 13R Sandstone Magnetic Case, you add sleek drop protection as well as MagSafe or Qi2 support to your 13R, minus the wireless charging aspect. This means you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">magnetic add-ons</a> like stands, mounts, grips, holders, and more with the OnePlus 13R. It's definitely worth $25, especially when you take a closer look at that exquisite glittery sandstone finish of the phone cover.</p><p>Those who have a tighter budget can opt for most of the other cases and still be happy. If magnetism is what's important to you, the $13 NOUKAJU OnePlus 13R Magnetic Type Protective Case will be a more suitable pick. It's filthy cheap, has a MagSafe ring on the back, adds a frame for impact absorption, and has a semi-transparent back which looks pretty cool.</p>

<ul><li>Google Chrome is testing a new feature dubbed PermissionsAI behind a flag.</li><li>The new flag, when enabled, would showcase quieter browser permission notifications based on the user's previous browsing behavior.</li><li>To do so, it utilizes Chrome's Permission Predictions Services and also takes the help of Gemini Nano v2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Chrome already offers protection with AI to its users to ensure a safer browser experience. New findings indicate that AI will further be used for quieter browser permission notifications.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://windowsreport.com/google-chrome-to-use-ai-for-quieter-browser-permission-notifications/">WindowsReport</a>, the new permissions feature is currently being tested under a flag in Chrome Canary. The feature is seemingly dubbed "PermissionsAI," and it utilizes AI to predict the chances of a user granting certain permissions for a particular site based on their previous browsing behavior. In turn, it will showcase such requests in a quieter interface than the traditional ones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:756px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:17.20%;"><img id="t7vorZVmzk5BdpFJVt7nr8" name="google-chrome-permissionsAI-flag" alt="PermissionsAI flag on Chrome" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7vorZVmzk5BdpFJVt7nr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="756" height="130" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WindowsReport)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The respective flag description indicates that PermissionsAI would be utilizing the browser's Permission Predictions Service alongside Gemini Nano v2 to "surface permission requests using a quieter UI when the likelihood of the user granting the permission is predicted to be low."</p><p>The said feature also requires Google Chrome's "Safe browsing" feature to be enabled. It is still unclear how precisely it will work and can only be witnessed whenever the feature rolls out officially. As mentioned, it is currently available in the testing phase and not yet to the general public.</p>
<p>With quiet permission pop-ups, PermissionsAI will certainly be a nifty new addition to the Chrome browser, which has already incorporated Gemini AI in various parts, including the use of AI in history searches, organizing tabs, and the "Tab compare" feature. The aforementioned Safe browsing feature is also AI-powered.</p><p>Previous versions of Chrome Canary have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-scam-detection-canary-flag">indicated</a> that Chrome could soon use AI detection for scams and data siphons. This will supposedly leverage its on-device LLM to scan a website that the user is visiting for potential scams or chances that could put your data at risk of being stolen.</p><p>Another AI feature, Store Reviews, was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">also spotted</a> in the works. It would summarize reviews from websites like TrustPilot for the products users intend to purchase.</p>

<hr>
<p>Another Galaxy S25 series leak seemingly points us toward a souped-up version of a recent Qualcomm chipset.</p><p>The recent string of rumors stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1880320175163195582">X tipster Arsène Lupin</a>, who posted a set of three specification images concerning the entire Galaxy S25 series. The most important part of this leak is the supposed existence of a "Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy" SoC. The rumor claims that this flagship chip variant is persistent across all three of the upcoming S25 phones.</p><p>This particular leak highlights the Galaxy S25 Ultra's 1TB variant, but it states it will receive 12GB of RAM with it.</p><p>It's a curious aspect of this leak, one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-could-bump-up-ram-in-its-higher-end-models">that goes against</a> what's previously been rumored for the phone.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">25 pic.twitter.com/rW5EGZJbY9<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1880320175163195582">January 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Rumors of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-use-an-overclocked-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-in-the-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> cropped up at the top of 2025. The upcoming Ultra model was spotted moving through Geekbench 6 for its typical performance and clock speed tests. Interestingly, the database detailed that the chip the phone contained received lower scores than what's been tested in other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">8 Elite</a>-packed devices. However, what stood out was its clock speeds — those were a bit higher.</p><p>Per the listing, the S25 Ultra's speeds clocked in at 4.47GHz for two of its cores which normally have a speed of 4.32GHz. The rest of the chip's cores saw a speed of 3.53 GHz, which is in line with the recent chip's performance following launch.</p><p>The performance scores probably aren't something to sound the alarm over. Once again, the device in this Geekbench 6 listing had 12GB of RAM despite rumors claiming a 16GB version is possible. If true, it could mean that this overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy will see higher overall scores/performance.</p><p>Also, it <em>kind of </em>makes sense for Samsung to chase another "for Galaxy" chip variant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-snapdragon-8-gen-3-for-galaxy">considering the Galaxy S24 had one</a>.</p><p>In other news, the specifications leaked by X tipster Lupin today (January 17) double down on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">what recently surfaced</a>. A major Galaxy S25 spec leak might've told us everything we need to know about the series, like the Ultra model's 6.9-inch, WQHD resolution display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The phone's cameras were also on deck, with rumors suggesting users might see a 200MP primary camera, a 50MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 50MP periscope telephoto camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will reportedly feature a 6.2-inch Full HD Plus display and a 6.7-inch WQHD resolution screen, respectively. The leak added that both phones will see the same triple camera array and boast a 50MP primary lens, a 12MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is preparing for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">a January 22 debut</a>.

Running on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-pixel-9s-satellite-sos-runs-on-tech-from-skylo-and-garmin">technology from Skylo and Garmin</a>,  the feature works in the U.S. right now (with the exception of Hawaii and Alaska) and only with certain carriers.</p><p>It’s compatible with the Google Pixel 9 series, including the Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold models. If you have one of these devices, it can be an invaluable tool in the event of a real-life emergency.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-set-up-emergency-sos-2">How to set up Emergency SOS</h2>
<p>The first thing you will want to do is set up emergency SOS on the device. This feature is available for most Android devices.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>.</p><p>4. Select <strong>setup</strong> at the bottom, right.</p>

<p>5. From here, you can change how to <strong>trigger Emergency SOS</strong> (touch and hold or wait for a five-second countdown), edit emergency SOS actions, add your emergency services number, and add emergency contacts.</p><p>6. Once you have adjusted settings to your liking, select <strong>Done</strong>. You can also try the demo if you want to confirm that it works and see how so you’re prepared should you ever need to actually invoke it.</p>

<p>Once Emergency SOS is set up, the steps for setting up and trying Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9 are largely the same.</p><p>1. Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</p><p>2. Select <strong>Safety & emergency</strong>.</p><p>3. Select <strong>Pixel Satellite SOS</strong>.</p>

<p>4. From there, you can <strong>edit the sharing preferences</strong> and <strong>demo Satellite SOS</strong> to get a walk-through of the process of how it works. This includes sending text messages to emergency response through the simulation of a situation in which you don’t have an active service connection.</p>

<p>If you find yourself in an emergency, here’s what to do. First, <strong>dial 9-1-1</strong>, and if the phone can’t connect, <strong>wait for the Satellite SOS icon</strong> to pop up and select it. Select <strong>Start</strong>, answer a few questions about the emergency (like you’re lost, trapped, or have come across someone else in need of emergency help), add details about the type of location (like a trail or a cave) and a timeline (how long have you been away?). You can also choose to notify the emergency contacts you have set up in the app by tapping <strong>Notify</strong> or selecting <strong>Don’t notify</strong> if you want to leave it to first responders.</p><p>The phone will show on-screen prompts to help you position your phone for the best signal to a satellite. Once connected, the phone will reach out to emergency services and share your information, and you should receive a reply within a few minutes. Stay on the line with emergency services if needed, or select <strong>End</strong> to end the session and wait for help to arrive. You can select “Yes, I still need help,” and emergency services will proceed with the call, even if you end it. If you have found a resolution, select “No, I don’t need help,” and the call will be canceled.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-satellite-sos-on-the-pixel-9-2">What else to know about Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9</h2>
<p>You don’t actually have to enable Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9. It automatically pops up when necessary and can contact emergency services for you. From there, you can proceed with the steps noted above, including describing the emergency in a short questionnaire and waiting for a reply from your local emergency services provider, which will hopefully send help your way.</p><p>Make sure to follow the prompts to correctly position your phone to get a proper satellite signal and remain outdoors with a clear view of the sky so the connection will work. You also need to have Google Messages set up as your default messaging app for the service to work. (If you don’t, or change it to another app, you will receive a message notifying you that Satellite SOS won’t be available unless you change it back).</p><p>It's worth noting that if someone were to pick up your phone, they would be able to see the lock screen message and your emergency information, even if the phone is locked. If you wish to turn this feature off, you can do so within the Personal Safety app. But considering this would only come up at a time when you might be in danger, you could probably use all the help you can get.</p><p>Satellite SOS on the Pixel 9 is free for the first two years. But after that, you will likely have to pay a subscription fee if you want to continue to have access to the feature. Nonetheless, set it up now and make use of the next 24 months of access to it.</p><p>There are a number of reasons the Google Pixel 9 is a worthwhile buy: we name the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> right now. Satellite SOS is a handy feature that could literally save your life, and it counts among the many ways this phone line-up is the best Google has to offer.</p>

<hr>
<p>A recent discovery suggests that Samsung will enhance its collaboration with Google on Android 15 to further its on-device AI assistance.</p><p>As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1879905849520590896">Chunvn8888 on X</a>, Samsung might integrate several of its apps on Galaxy devices with Google's Gemini (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/stock-samsung-apps-one-ui-7-0-gemini-ai-integration/">SamMobile</a>). This integration seems to create a set of mini, Galaxy-exclusive Gemini extensions for Samsung's next software release as the AI could grab Calendar, Notes, and Reminders. For the former, the leak suggests Galaxy users could ask Gemini to "create, edit, or delete" events from their Samsung Calendars.</p><p>Another feature could leverage more of Gemini's intelligence as the rumored extension could "capture info from images to create events."</p><p>Regarding Samsung Notes, Gemini could accept commands to "create and summarize" entries, as well as surface stored data based on your description. The Reminders app extension will supposedly let Gemini create new ones for the user, per their request.</p><p>Editing privileges and a search function are rumored, as well.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The pics description are pretty understandable so I just leave those here 🫡 pic.twitter.com/nlsvnkkWLC<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1879905849520590896">January 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The publication speculates these three extensions could arrive with Samsung's launch of One UI 7 (Android 15). Additionally, the X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/chunvn8888/status/1879964832428109874">mentioned</a> in their thread that there are "more" extensions than the three we've seen.</p><p><em>If </em>Samsung is preparing for a few Galaxy-exclusive Gemini extensions, it would make sense given the recent leaks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-promo-video-leak">involving AI experiences</a>. The leak involved a short teaser for Galaxy S25's reception of Gemini-backed assistance through One UI 7. Specifically, it showed how Google's AI could help the next wave of Galaxy phones with the Messages app.</p><p>Other AI-based features included "Audio Eraser" and the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action">Now Bar</a>," which has been prominent in the beta.</p><p>The Now Bar is said to bring a little AI magic to the Galaxy S25's lock screen. The small icon at the bottom of the display will provide a "Now Brief" that brings the user highlights regarding sleep, travel information, music, and more. Samsung stated in a post that the lock screen's feature will leverage the user's most used apps for the briefing to ensure that you're never left out.</p><p>The AI will also provide "personalized" suggestions for what you should do next.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 series is preparing to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">debut on January 22</a>.

You get the outstanding power of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, plus a reliable two-day battery, 256GB of storage, and flagship-quality camera tech straight out of the box. It is, without a doubt, the best value for phones in this price range, and that&apos;s saying a lot, considering how many great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> are out there nowadays. </p><p>That being said, if you can afford it, I&apos;d recommend skipping the 13R and going straight for the base model OnePlus 13. That device is likely to be the best Android phone released in 2025, with better hardware, features, and durability than its midrange counterpart. Is it worth the extra $300 on the price tag? That&apos;s up to you, but I&apos;d check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r">our OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 13</a> guide if you want to learn more. </p>

<ul><li>OpenAI's ChatGPT is rolling out a beta for a new feature dubbed "Scheduled Tasks."</li><li>These Tasks let users tell the AI what they need to stay reminded about or for news of a particular subject.</li><li>ChatGPT's Scheduled Tasks are rolling out for Plus, Pro, and Team users on Android, iOS, the web, and MacOS.</li><li>OpenAI recently debuted ChatGPT Search, which is yet another area the company has moved in on that reminds you of Google.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OpenAI is bringing a new feature to its ChatGPT beta testers that might aid them with daily tasks.</p><p>Recently, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt">detailed the start</a> of its "Scheduled Tasks" beta for ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizchina.com/2025/01/15/openai-launches-tasks-feature-your-new-personal-digital-assistant/">Gizchina</a>). The changelog states that users can utilize Scheduled Tasks to create "automated prompts" that ChatGPT will run at your specified time and date. The feature is reportedly available after tapping your profile icon and navigating to "Tasks."</p><p>From there, users can create a title and an appropriate schedule. However, the most important aspect of this is the "instructions" box.</p><p>This box is where users can ask ChatGPT to remind them about something that needs to be done <em>or </em>to scour the internet for information and news. The post gives the following example: "Can you give me a briefing on AI news each afternoon?"</p><p>As the beta begins, OpenAI is already detailing the limitations of its AI-based Tasks feature. It states that, due to its utilization of GPT-4o, ChatGPT can handle 10 tasks at a time. Moreover, Tasks does not support voice chats, file uploads, or GPTs.</p><p>Some additional details regarding Tasks include the tester's ability to "edit" and "pause" them. Additionally, users can open Tasks up to notifications via the web. The company states that users will likely have to grant the AI the appropriate permissions before it can alert you once a Task is ready.</p><p>Speaking of notifications, ChatGPT's Scheduled Tasks are available for testers via mobile (Android/iOS), the web, and MacOS. Users with the Windows app will have to wait until later in Q1.</p>

<p>Users with ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Team should begin noticing Scheduled Tasks appear with the "beta" tag.</p><p>We've heard of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gets-google-keep-and-google-tasks-extensions-support">Tasks from Google</a> before and it seems that OpenAI's ChatGPT is moving in (once again) on the former's territory. More importantly, OpenAI moved in on a major part of what Google is known for in October as it debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-chatgpt-search-feature-rollout">ChatGPT Search</a>. At its core, this AI-powered search engine lets users conversate with the AI for "quick, relevant information." OpenAI also highlighted its work with news and data providers to ensure that the information users see is up-to-date.</p><p>Elsewhere, ChatGPT Search prominently features "Sources" for users interested in fact-checking the AI's online work.</p><p>What makes this feel like Google is that ChatGPT Search's responses are designed to be quick and succinct. Kind of like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gen-ai-search-upgrades-io-2024">Google's AI Overviews</a>.</p>

<p>All eyes are on the Galaxy S25 series as their launch is gearing up for next week. However, it isn't stopping the leaks, and the latest one reveals the alleged Galaxy S25 series in a promo video.</p><p>Tipster OnLeaks shared the leaked promo for the Galaxy S25 series with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/01/exclusive-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-promo-video.html">Android Headlines</a>. The promo offers what to expect from the trio, including the handsets' AI prowess and photography features.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey #FutureSquad! How about an early look at #GalaxyS25 Series first promo video, highlighting #Samsung's new #GalaxyAI features?...😏 On behalf of @Androidheadline 👉🏻 https://t.co/aE6O4ffUmP pic.twitter.com/Bur7lF9GcJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1880263174370501051">January 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy AI-focused short promo video begins by showcasing the Galaxy S25 Ultra in action—starting with the popular Now Bar, recently introduced via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a>. The video gives us a good look at the  Galaxy AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-latest-galaxy-s25-leak-gives-us-a-glimpse-of-a-new-one-ui-7-feature-in-action">"Now Brief" feature accessed</a> through Now Bar, which will brief your everyday mornings with weather forecasts and other popular health insights.</p><p>The video further focuses on Gemini's integration into the Google Messages app and how it will be beneficial in everyday lives for Galaxy S25 users. Later in the video, users can expect the Galaxy S25 Ultra's Night Video capture capabilities, and the popular Audio Eraser feature is also demonstrated. It helps users minimize unwanted sounds like voices, wind, and noise — captured in the video.</p><p>While it is a short leaked video, we also get to glance at all four supposed Galaxy S25 models at the end, presumably the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, the Galaxy S25 Ultra with S-Pen, and likely the Galaxy S25 Slim featured.</p>
<p>The latter happens to be the brand-new addition to the lot, which appears to have a sleek form factor, as the name implies. The recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-slim-thinness-specs-renders-leaked">leaked renders</a> gave us what to expect from the handset, including its design, color options, and even the dimensions.</p><p>Per the leak, users can expect the phone to be as thin as 6.4mm, which makes it 1.8mm thinner than the upcoming Galaxy S25 Ultra. Like the other trio, the Slim Galaxy phone is also expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset and at least 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">everything planned</a> for January 22; it has already started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">reservations</a> for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-unpacked-january-2025">Galaxy S25 series launch</a>. Per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-sale-and-availability">latest leak</a>, consumers who preorder during the launch are expected to receive their handsets by February 3.</p>

You won't get as many software updates either, and I'd recommend getting the 13R if you need a new phone. </p></p>

<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N3aMiHiKHvuyugLJpuCEDT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N3aMiHiKHvuyugLJpuCEDT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> has a new design with flat sides, and honestly, I'm not a fan of the design. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-vs-oneplus-13r">OnePlus 13</a> has subtle bevels to make it easier to hold the device, the 13R is boxy, and it makes holding and using the phone uncomfortable. It has an aluminum mid-frame, and while it is technically thinner than the 12R, that isn't evident when holding both phones next to one another. <br><br>I like the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a> better; the dual-curved aesthetic makes the phone a delight to use, and it just feels better. That said, there's an increased risk of the front or rear panes of glass taking damage should the device take a tumble, and the 13R switched to a boxy design to avoid these issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FjdWMgqnqmFwT6kkGWtK4T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FjdWMgqnqmFwT6kkGWtK4T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both devices have the alert slider, and they have fingerprint sensors located awkwardly; the 12R has the module too high up on the panel, and the 13R has one that sits too low. Rounding out the design, the 12R gets IP64 dust and water resistance, with the 13R picking up IP65. I would have liked to see IP67 on the device, but that isn't the case this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sfk3Z63yos48uth28FVC3T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sfk3Z63yos48uth28FVC3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Switching over to the panel, both phones use the same 6.78-inch BOE AMOLED 120Hz screen, with identical brightness and color vibrancy. There isn't any issue with either device in outdoor use, and they do a great job delivering vibrant colors in HDR content and daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FdPQYXKj3v8ASm4mGgL48T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FdPQYXKj3v8ASm4mGgL48T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only notable difference is that the 13R has a fully flat panel, so if you're not a fan of the design of the 12R, you'll like what the manufacturer is doing this time. Outside of that, the quality of the AMOLED panel itself is unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-hardware-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Hardware</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9gUEGyG4kn8PSHefpje93T" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9gUEGyG4kn8PSHefpje93T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R has a considerable leg up over the 12R, and that's because it comes with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It has outstanding performance in daily use as well as gaming, and I didn't notice any slowdowns whatsoever. You also get 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage on the base model, and 12GB of RAM as standard this time. <br><br>The 12R is still decent enough in this area, but the base model has an 8GB/128GB configuration, and you just get more with the 13R. On that note, the 13R has a bigger 6000mAh battery as well, and is able to last a day and a half with ease. By contrast, the 12R averages a day with heavy use.</p>

<p>There isn't much else to talk about on the hardware side of things; both phones have strong packages, but the 13R gives you additional power, and the battery lasts longer. That said, the phone takes considerably longer to charge, going up to 56 minutes to charge the battery. The 12R, meanwhile, charges in just over 30 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-cameras-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g6LviReoKbcxCxVzEgRPFT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g6LviReoKbcxCxVzEgRPFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is using the same 50MP main camera, but changes to the tuning algorithms mean you get better photos. There's still some issues with tonal balance in low-light scenarios, but on the whole, it is a stronger package than last year. You even get a 50MP 2x lens this time, but the 8MP wide-angle is the same as the 12R, and it is just as average as last year. <br><br>On the whole, the 13R takes better shots in daylight situations, and the 2x lens gives the device an added versatility that's missing on the 12R. While the camera isn't quite as good as the OnePlus 13, it is among the better options in this category, and the tweaks to the 13R allow it to take the lead.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-13r-vs-oneplus-12r-software-2">OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2ENQ2MBVyaQuokR67hDPGT" name="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" alt="OnePlus 13R vs. OnePlus 12R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2ENQ2MBVyaQuokR67hDPGT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R runs OxygenOS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and the interface is fluid in regular use. You don't get many new features, but there is added customizability, and that's always a good thing. The software is heavily styled, so if you need a minimal interface, your best bet is still a Pixel. <br><br>That said, I didn't notice any bugs or run into issues on the software front, and that's a refreshing change of pace from previous years. There is bloatware out of the box, but it can be easily uninstalled. Outside of that, OxygenOS 15 is generally great, and it's good to see the UI not riddled with bugs at launch. <br><br>The 13R will pick up additional updates as well, with the phone slated to receive four years of Android OS updates along with six years of security updates. The 12R will get three Android OS updates (including Android 15), so it won't go beyond Android 17.</p>

<p>If you want a new phone and are deciding between these two choices, you should just get the OnePlus 13R. While I don't like the design as much, that's about the only major negative over the 12R. The 13R has better hardware, more memory and storage as standard, takes better photos, lasts longer, and will get more updates. <br><br>The phone costs $100 more in the U.S., but you're ultimately getting a better overall value. This is a no-brainer in India, where the OnePlus 13R costs the same as the 12R; if you're in the country, you should buy the 13R without any hesitation. Even in other regions, the number of upgrades on offer make the OnePlus 13R my recommendation.</p>

In just a few short weeks, I've seen phones put in dishwashers, used as cutting boards, and run over by moving vehicles. That's only the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>Honor sent me to its Magic 7 series launch event in Slovenia this week, and the company encouraged myself and other reviewers in attendance to push the Magic 7 Pro to its limits. That comes shortly after OnePlus invited my colleague Nicholas Sutrich to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">watch the OnePlus 13 survive a dishwasher run</a>, too.</p><p>You might be wondering what all this is about, and whether you should care — after a few days of putting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> to the test firsthand, I think I know the answer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xLJzAV329X599VP3aHaA8d" name="Honor-Magic-7-Pro-Dishwasher-2" alt="The Honor Magic 7 Pro in a dishwasher." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xLJzAV329X599VP3aHaA8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">That's the Honor Magic 7 Pro surviving a dishwasher run with ease. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The crave for extreme durability protection for smartphones started a long time ago, when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">phones first began supporting IP ratings</a> against dust and water ingress. That's a fancy way of saying that phone brands wanted to keep dust and liquids from getting inside smartphones. Premium materials, like titanium, stainless steel, and hardened glass helped fortify phones against hard drops and scuffs.</p><p>If you've ever dropped a phone on the beach or in the pool, you'll understand why. But the first Android phone to feature some degree of water resistance was the Motorola Defy about 15 years ago, so why is this extreme durability push happening now?</p><p>The truth is that new processes and innovations have enabled phones, such as the OnePlus 13, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Motorola Moto G Power</a> or Honor Magic 7 Pro, to withstand situations that were once inconceivable. For starters, the first wave of IP69-certified smartphones are hitting global markets. Previously, IP68 was understood to be the highest level of protection against dust and water ingress. That's changed with the advent of IP69, which represents an extra degree of protection against extreme pressure, temperature, and steam.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5" name="Honor-Magic-7-Pro-Dishwasher" alt="The Honor Magic 7 Pro durability tested in a kitchen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zrK2oJANH5u3D24ZByoeP5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In essence, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">devices with IP68/IP69 ratings</a> can survive even the toughest challenges, like being placed in the dishwasher. The photos above show Honor putting the Magic 7 Pro in a countertop dishwasher with the display still running, and it's something that felt surreal in person.</p><p>That wasn't all. Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-the-magic-7-lite-in-europe-with-an-industry-first-battery-tech">touted the Magic 7 Lite's "Anti-Drop Display,"</a> which it says is made out of ultra-tempered glass. To put it to the test, the brand put the phone under the knife, using it as a cutting board to chop up a banana. They offered to let me try it for myself, and I winced at the idea of purposefully putting a knife against a phone screen — as a tech journalist, it feels like that should be against my religion.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C679N6whJ8Nogqbc9wXmRY" name="Honor-Magic-7-Lite-Knife" alt="Cutting a banana on a Magic 7 Lite phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679N6whJ8Nogqbc9wXmRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that just about sums up how confident companies are getting about their phones' durability. It's easy to make claims on spec sheets and press releases. It's a lot more brazen to conduct real-world tests in front of reporters, where there's always a chance of disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BqGf8pqCZi0" target="_blank">like the infamous Tesla Cybertruck reveal</a>.</p><p>Things once again took a borderline insane turn when Honor let the Magic 7 Lite get run over by an ATV, and then get casually dropped off an ATV driving at speed on a rocky dirt road.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WesE8rVGTSU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>It's absolutely impressive that the Honor Magic 7 Lite, a phone that costs under €400 in Europe, can survive these kinds of tests. It's also quite nice that the Motorola Moto G Power, soon to be available for under $300 in the U.S., supports IP68/IP69 durability ratings. But how much should this matter to a normal person like you and me, who uses their phone for normal tasks?</p><p>I think that depends. After I saw what the Magic 7 Pro and Lite could do, I also became a little brazen while testing out my loaner device. While using the phone caseless, I recorded videos of myself sledding and driving my own quad bike with the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Maybe you don't need a dedicated action camera or a rugged case if these are the kinds of extreme situations that your phone is tested to survive.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Jjv93PGr8E" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>With that being said, the Honor Magic 7 series isn't indestructible. It's going to break, scratch, and crack under the right conditions. While I watched the Magic 7 Lite survive roughly a four-foot fall at speed in Slovenia, it's possible your phone falls out of your pocket at the dinner table and cracks. Sometimes, there's no rhyme or reason to when phones fail, no matter how durability standards they meet or how many real-world tests they survive.</p><p>So, I won't go out and say that buying a OnePlus 13 or a Magic 7 series phone is a must if you care about durability. However, I will say that from what I've seen, phone brands are getting more confident than ever about their devices' durability.</p><p>Whether you use your smartphone to go to the office and back or take it on extreme excursions, that's good news. Anything that can be done to make phones tougher to crack and prevent water or dust from entering is a solid step in the right direction. With the advent of IP69 smartphones, it's possible that phones like the Honor Magic 7 Pro, Moto G Power, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Oppo Find X8 Pro</a>, and OnePlus 13 aren't just taking a step — they could be taking a leap.</p>

Honor is doubling down on AI integration, rolling out a slate of new features that transform how you use the phone. <br><br>There's a new design as well, the latest Qualcomm hardware, a third-gen silicon-carbon battery, and upgraded cameras — including a 200MP telephoto lens at the back. The software has gotten a fresh coat of paint as well, with the phone running MagicOS 9.0 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. <br><br>With other Chinese brands raising the bar for imaging thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, I wanted to see how Honor measures up. I used the Magic 7 Pro as my daily driver for just over two weeks, and here's why I think it is one of the best phones of 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kALW2PBmVMTYGaUES36JUC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kALW2PBmVMTYGaUES36JUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor unveiled the Magic 7 Pro in China on October 30, and the phone made its global debut at an event in Slovenia on January 15, 2025. It is now on sale in global markets in a single 12GB/512GB variant, which costs £1,099 ($1,343) in the U.K. and €1,299 ($1,336) in other countries in Europe. <br><br>Honor is incentivizing the launch in the U.K. by providing a £200 ($244) discount and the 100W charger (which isn't bundled this time), and rolling out a one-time replacement within 180 days. This is highly interesting, and similar to what OnePlus did with the OnePlus 13 in India. Essentially, if you notice any hardware issues within six months of use, you'll be eligible to get a new Magic 7 Pro instead of sending it in for service.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-design"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tVxHWUQiMn4v4E9tcr96XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro next to Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tVxHWUQiMn4v4E9tcr96XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other phone I used recently, the Magic 7 Pro has a design with flat sides. It's clear that all manufacturers are gravitating toward this design aesthetic, and I can see the reason why; not having dual-curved edges means the glass panes are less prone to breakage in the case of a tumble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3voE6dVGw4QcZAutEfhSWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro profile view with IR blaster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3voE6dVGw4QcZAutEfhSWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the sides are thicker, the use of beveled edges make holding and using the phone comfortable. This is in line with what OnePlus did on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and the Magic 7 Pro has a similar in-hand feel. Weight distribution is great as well, and even though you get a massive camera island at the back, the device doesn't feel unwieldy in the least.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7ssfJN8CuoPeuUf5xcPDYC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view with camera island highlighted against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ssfJN8CuoPeuUf5xcPDYC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the changes to the camera island as well; the module is inlaid with metal and has a squircle design, and it looks cleaner than last year. The way the island merges seamlessly into the back is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oppo-find-x5-pro-review">Find X5 Pro</a>, and the overall effect is elegant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qm2LQppkPAdkKztnqW2MRC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qm2LQppkPAdkKztnqW2MRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Magic 7 Pro is available in blue, black, and Lunar Shadow Grey color variants, and the latter option is the most interesting of the lot. I got the black model, and it isn't anywhere as interesting — if you're eyeing the device, I'd suggesting picking up the grey model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ktpAWBT9NUmSuhx6g4fFSC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ktpAWBT9NUmSuhx6g4fFSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back doesn't draw too much attention to itself (at least in this colorway), and you get a silky texture that ensures smudges don't show up. There's adequate width on the sides to hold the device comfortably, and the power button has a red accent that gives it a little bit of character.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RRQ5DrS2GVCVjzTJMhBKVC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RRQ5DrS2GVCVjzTJMhBKVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another positive is the ultrasonic sensor; it is located in the ideal position, and is fast to authenticate. Honor is an outlier among Android manufacturers in that it uses a secondary camera at the front, and this is used to enable 3D face unlock. While all Android phones have a similar feature, they're not as secure as biometrics; thankfully, that isn't an issue on the Magic 7 Pro, and you get two secure methods to unlock the device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="quuM2uw7phRsfVxx2FQ6TC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro bottom view with USB-C charging port" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quuM2uw7phRsfVxx2FQ6TC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to other Chinese phones, the Magic 7 Pro gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, and it can withstand immersion in up to 1.5 meters of water in addition to high pressure water jets and hot liquids up to 80 degrees Celsius. If anything, the only quibble I have with the design is that the device is heavy at 223g — the same as the X200 Pro. However, you get a smaller 5270mAh battery (X200 Pro has 6000mAh), and the phone is chunkier at 8.8mm (versus 8.2mm).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7RG4bxNboXmKKtnjEKNTWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7RG4bxNboXmKKtnjEKNTWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, there are no problems with the design. In addition to the regular model, Honor is rolling out the Porsche Design variant of the device, and like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/porsche-design-honor-magic-6-rsr-review">Magic 6 RSR</a>, it has a hexagonal camera island and is available in two interesting colors. The rest of the hardware is identical to the regular model, but you get a few unique UI elements, and I particularly like the Standby mode that's available on the device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-display"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="psquvKEFg3gdjXcU97mSWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro home page with colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psquvKEFg3gdjXcU97mSWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is using a similar-sized 6.8-inch AMOLED panel as last year, and you get the same 5000-nit maximum brightness. That number is meaningless in real-world use as it's only limited to select zones when viewing HDR content; thankfully, the phone holds up rather well even under harsh sunlight, and it is among the brightest I tested — only the Pixel 9 Pro XL got brighter in outdoor use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VFZixvLaZ86tm5UVdT9HcC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro with YouTube video" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VFZixvLaZ86tm5UVdT9HcC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Colors are vibrant and detailed, and contrast levels are excellent as well. The phone goes up to 120Hz, and like other flagships, you get dynamic refresh that scales it between 1Hz to 120Hz based on the on-screen content. The phone has HDR integration, and there's a dynamic video mode that boosts colors in the gallery, Instagram, and YouTube.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oWDbPoboHNFz8iiSJbdBZC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro eye comfort settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWDbPoboHNFz8iiSJbdBZC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like last year, you get 4320Hz PWM dimming, and while other manufacturers are now doing the same on their devices, Honor leads the way when it comes to eye-care tech on its phones. The Magic 7 Pro gets a suite of features in this regard, including myopic defocus stimulation, circular polarization, and natural tone. In short, the Magic 7 Pro has enough novel display tech that if you're worried about eye fatigue or strain, this is clearly the device to get.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ERLqiebQxWJBZhjWoVJ3YC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro ebook mode with Kindle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ERLqiebQxWJBZhjWoVJ3YC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While all of those features are great, what I like the most is that there's a dedicated ebook mode that switches the panel to monochrome. I used this feature extensively in legacy OxygenOS and MIUI builds, but it's not available in recent versions of the skins, so it's great to see Honor offering the feature.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sAfdMaykHW4v6thikCaxWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAfdMaykHW4v6thikCaxWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had no issues with the Magic 7 Pro when it comes to playing videos or gaming, and the phone has outstanding built-in stereo sound. Honor says it increased the sound cavity this time to create a sense of depth, and that's noticeable in daily use.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-performance"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Performance</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HEw3C2BcChtPzq4BbcWRVC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro about page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HEw3C2BcChtPzq4BbcWRVC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor went with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite, and the global model is sold in a 12GB/512GB configuration. Ideally, Honor should have brought the 16GB/512GB edition outside China, but that isn't the case. Regardless, I didn't see any issues with memory being the bottleneck in the two weeks I used the device.<br><br>Similar to other flagships I tested recently, the phone absolutely flies in regular use, and there are no slowdowns whatsoever. The phone handles demanding games without breaking a sweat, and if anything, there's a sense that we need better games on Android to take full advantage of the power available this generation.</p>

<p>The only issue in this area is that the device gets noticeably hotter than its rivals during extended gaming sessions. I saw the phone go up to 48 degrees Celsius, four degrees hotter than the X200 Pro. The upside is that the Magic 7 Pro posted the highest scores of any device I tested.</p><p>While most brands prioritize thermal management, Honor has a higher threshold in this area, with little to no throttling until the device gets hot enough that you won't be able to hold it comfortably anyway. Outside of that, there are no problems with the hardware.</p><p>Call and cellular connectivity is great, and you get an AI privacy mode and ambient noise reduction while making calls. The vibration motor is decent enough as well, and while you don't get feedback while navigating the interface — a long-standing issue in MagicOS — you can set up Gboard to use the haptic motor, and it works well. <br><br>Coming to connectivity, you get the usual Wi-Fi 7 modem and Bluetooth 5.4, along with NFC, dual-band GPS, AptX HD, and USB-C over the USB 3.2 standard with DisplayPort 1.2. You can easily connect the device to an external monitor, and it holds up well in this situation.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-battery-life"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Battery life</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aBmNSXcr9a4kzw34yUrVWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro battery section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aBmNSXcr9a4kzw34yUrVWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor has been using silicon-carbon batteries on its phones for over two years now, and the Magic 7 Pro sees the debut of the third-gen silicon tech. The material used in the anode of the battery is made by Group14, and Honor went with a single-cell design. <br><br>Annoyingly, the global model of the Magic 7 Pro has a smaller 5270mAh battery, while the Chinese variant has a 5850mAh battery. I still got a day's worth of use consistently even with heavy use, and didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day. With medium use, the phone manages to last a day and a half, but battery life isn't as great as the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PErv6dQxcnGAjCKFrEdfUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get 100W charging, and while that's great to see, Honor isn't bundling a charger this time. While Apple, Samsung, and Google don't include a charger on their phones, their devices still use outdated charging tech, and any basic USB PD charger will be more than adequate. That isn't the case on Chinese phones, so to not include a charger is an egregious omission. <br><br>The phone has 80W wireless charging as well, but I wasn't able to test it out as I don't have a requisite charger. Anyway, it takes just under 50 minutes to charge the battery using Honor's 100W charger, and you can use a USB PD charger with the phone as well, which will lower the charging speed to 60W. <br><br>Honor has the usual battery modes that allow you to set a charging limit, and optimize charging when you have the phone plugged in overnight. While the battery life is great in its own right, the lack of a bundled charger is irksome to say the least.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-honor-magic-7-pro-cameras"><span>Honor Magic 7 Pro: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="roDugFqpKLorseDCnmsCbC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roDugFqpKLorseDCnmsCbC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor is using a 50MP Super Dynamic Falcon Main Camera on the Magic 7 Pro, and as you can imagine, it does a pretty great job in challenging situations. The most notable inclusion is a 200MP telephoto lens, and it does a magnificent job. Honor isn't using Samsung's latest HP9 imaging module like the Vivo X100 Ultra and X200 Pro — instead leveraging the HP3 sensor — but you get 3x optical zoom, 6x lossless zoom, and AI-assisted digital zoom going up to 100x. There's also a 50MP wide-angle lens, and a 50MP camera at the front. <br><br>Honor is debuting a new image engine where it's leaning heavily on AI models to tweak every photo, including adjusting shadows and highlights. The reasoning is that you get standout shots in any scenario, and while it works well most of the time, it leads to a few inconsistencies when shooting in little to no light. <br><br>You get the usual suite of AI-assisted object detection and edition tools, and the camera interface itself hasn't changed. All cameras can shoot 4K60 video, and you get HDR video that delivers better colors. Similar to last year, you get Harcourt profiles in portrait shots, with three options available: Vibrant, Colour, and Classic. <br><br>Honor is leveraging an on-device portrait library to enable AI-assisted portraits, and the brand says it has over a million shadow profiles and a billion settings. Toggling the feature does make a difference, and it is another way Honor is turning to AI to make its cameras stand out.</p>

<p>The main camera takes outstanding photos in any situation, delivering images with great dynamic range and white balance. Colors aren't overly saturated, foliage is rendered accurately, and it does a better job than last year in low-light images and videos. There are no issues with the wide-angle lens either, and it manages to take detailed shots in any situation. <br><br>One of the best things about having a telephoto lens with a massive sensor is that it doubles up as a portrait shooter, and the Magic 7 Pro does a brilliant job in this situation. It isn't quite as good as what Vivo manages on its devices, but it comes mighty close, delivering stunning photos at 3x and 6x. <br><br>There's 100x zoom as well, and like everything else, the feature is getting an infusion of AI — albeit via an OTA after January. Honor says you can get usable shots at 100x, with the phone using a cloud-based AI model to eke out additional details in shots. The phone uses an on-device model as long as the zoom factor is under 30x, and it is interesting to see how the feature holds up in actual use. <br><br>Overall, the Magic 7 Pro has one of the best camera packages available today, and while I still give the edge to Vivo's X200 Pro, there isn't as wide a gulf as last year, and that's great to see.</p>

<p>The Magic 7 Pro runs MagicOS 9.0 based on Android 15, and Honor is doubling down on AI features. While the UI itself is better than last year, it is in need of a visual overhaul. The notification pane needs attention as well, with Honor still using outdated cards which don't let you expand notifications with a pull-down gesture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="qG8rUE6XhqagMsugSBkxWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro notification pane" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qG8rUE6XhqagMsugSBkxWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm using a pre-release version of the software (build 9.0.0.132), and as the build doesn't have Google Play certification, it had issues installing apps I waste an inordinate amount of time on (Balatro and Relay). Honor says customers will have a day-one OTA that won't have these issues, and I'll update this post once that's available. <br><br>As for the software itself, the biggest difference between the China model and the global variant is that the latter has tight Google integration; Gemini is pre-installed, and you get Circle to Search as standard. There's no shortage of AI-based utilities, with the device offering real-time translation, notes summarization, text extraction, and so much more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro search using AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgDVCyYbZzA2MJpoGx72XC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Look, I'm not sold on the generative AI boondoggle, but an easy way to extract text from a PDF and paste it in a chat? I'm onboard with that. This is where Honor's Magic Portal becomes the differentiator; while the feature had limited usability in the past, there's integration with services you actually use now, and it's very handy to be able to paste text, links, and images when you're browsing into a chat, or send location details.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w8AokJEfa5B9RM3TWoDTWC" name="Honor Magic 7 Pro review" alt="Honor Magic 7 Pro Magic Portal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w8AokJEfa5B9RM3TWoDTWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, you get the ability to search text or images using a knock gesture, and it works reasonably well. Overall, I like what Honor is doing with the interface, and even though I'm not using the final build, I didn't run into any stability issues or lag. <br><br>When it comes to software updates, the Magic 7 Pro will get five years of Android OS updates alongside six years of security updates. That's more than what you get with other Chinese manufacturers, and is the right move by Honor.</p>

<p>With other brands releasing products sooner than before, there's a good selection of options if you want a high-end phone right now. Vivo's X200 Pro continues to deliver the best camera package, but the phone isn't available in the west, instead limited to Asian countries. <br><br>The OnePlus 13 doesn't have any shortcomings regarding availability, and it is one of the best devices you can buy in 2025. It has a gorgeous design, same great hardware as the Magic 7 Pro, and you get a bigger 6000mAh battery. The cameras are much better this time as well, and coming in at $899/£899, it undercuts the Magic 7 Pro by a considerable amount.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best display tech available</li><li>You want the latest hardware</li><li>You need versatile cameras that take great photos and videos</li><li>You're looking for useful AI tech</li></ul>

<p>Honor did all the right things with the Magic 7 Pro. The design makes the device better to hold and use, and it should have better durability as well. The high-quality AMOLED panel combined with all the eye protection features Honor included makes the screen on the Magic 7 Pro one of the best around, and there are absolutely no issues with color vibrancy or brightness levels. <br><br>There's nothing wrong with the hardware either; the phone blazes through demanding games, and while it gets hot during extended gaming sessions, there are no problems with throttling. I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day, and while it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro, it easily manages a day and a bit even with heavy use. <br><br>Then there's the software. Honor did a great job integrating AI-backed utilities into just about every facet of the interface, and they're actually useful. But it's the cameras that truly differentiate the Magic 7 Pro; the phone takes fantastic photos in just about any lighting situation, and you get detailed shots even at 30x zoom and beyond. <br><br>Should you get the Magic 7 Pro over what Google and Samsung have to offer? The camera is better than the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you get additional versatility thanks to the 200MP sensor, and the overall hardware is better as well. If anything, the biggest rival to the Magic 7 Pro is the Vivo X200 Pro, but seeing as how you can't get that device reliably in western markets, the Magic 7 Pro has a distinct advantage.</p>

It’s about 1.44GB, and you can grab it by heading to your phone's Settings menu and then navigating to "Download and install" under "System update."</p><p>However, the update is rolling out in stages, so it reaches users gradually.</p><p>As mentioned in Nothing's community <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/25045-cmf-phone-1-nothing-os-v30-250111-2249-changelog" target="_blank">post</a>, the CMF Phone 1 update brings a bunch of new features, like fresh widgets, customizable lock screen options, a revamped app drawer, and an improved quick settings menu.</p><p>Furthermore, it adds Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and all the other goodies you’d expect from Nothing OS 3.</p><p>Early feedback on the Nothing Phone (1) update shows it’s running smoothly, but there’s one downside: the Circle to Search feature, which is available on newer models, is missing here, as pointed out by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/16/nothing-phone-1-android-15-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The latest update for the Phone (1) likely marks its last major software update. Even so, Nothing is expected to make good on its promise of at least one more year of security patches to keep the device protected from new threats.</p><p>On the other hand, since the CMF Phone 1 launched with Android 14, it’s fair to expect at least one more major OS update down the line.</p><p>While Nothing is showing it’s serious about timely updates, even for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget-friendly phones</a>, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> series is still waiting on the One UI 7 update.</p><p>To be fair, Samsung has built a solid reputation for pushing out updates on time, so this delay with One UI 7 could just be them taking extra care to iron out any bugs before the stable release hits its devices.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is taking its AI model Gemini and bringing it to more users involved in two of its Workspace plans.</p><p>The company recently announced through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/expanding-google-ai-to-more-of-google-workspace.html">Workspace Updates</a> that it is bringing Gemini to users subscribed to its Workspace Business and Enterprise plans. Those with the Business Starter, Standard, and Plus plans started receiving Gemini on January 15. According to Google, its AI model additions will concern Gmail, Docs, Meet, Drive, Sheets, Chat, and Slides. Additionally, the company is giving its Business and Enterprise users access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> and NotebookLM Plus.</p><p>Google went into more detail regarding Gemini's debut in Business and Enterprise in a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/empowering-businesses-with-AI">blog post</a>.</p><p>There, the company states users will find "simplified pricing" with its included AI software. Google gives the example of a Workspace Business Standard user who, currently, pays $32 per month, per user. However, the simplified pricing will drop that total down to $14 per month, per user with the Gemini Business add-on. There is a fully updated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/15400543?visit_id=638726532376571327-897289470&p=gemini_update_business&rd=1">table of pricing</a> following this announcement available for users. The post states that its monthly pricing will see these updates on March 17 "or at renewal date with an Annual/Fixed-term plan."</p><p>What's more, Google mentioned security following its recent massive drop of AI to a wealth of its subscribers. The company states, "We don’t use your data, prompts, or generated responses to train Gemini models outside of your domain without permission." It adds that it also doesn't "sell your data" for ad purposes.</p><p>Users are said to remain in control, meaning that Gemini will only leverage data that you make available to it.</p><p>Speaking of your data, as Gemini rolls in, users will find a few features for each Workspace app, such as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">help me write</a>" in Gmail. The feature will help users "write and improve" emails and alter a message's tone of voice through Gemini. Additionally, like what you'll find in Docs, Gmail users will find AI-generated email and document summaries.</p>

<p>There were several other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-generative-ai">generative AI-based tools</a> that Google highlighted early last year for Workspace. Among them is the ability to have auto-generated images, audio, and videos for work in Slides. Joining that are auto-completed analyses, formula generation, and more in Sheets. Interested users can read the full changelog packed with Gemini AI assistance in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/01/expanding-google-ai-to-more-of-google-workspace.html#:~:text=January%2029%2C%202025%3A-,Gmail,-Help%20me%20write">updated Workspace post</a>.</p><p>As previously mentioned, Google is giving Workspace Business and Enterprise users access to its NotebookLM, which recently introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overviews</a>. These grant users two AI voices that act like co-hosts of a podcast or talk show. The AI will condense information in a lengthy document and turn it into something light, yet informational for you to listen to. The AI is said to "make connections" while it discusses the data you've provided.</p><p>In October, the company brought another update that lets users "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">guide</a>" the AI in NotebookLM. Essentially, users can tell the AI how the conversation should flow and what it should focus on.</p><p>As Google's Workspace Business users get into Gemini, the company states that its three Enterprise editions will receive the AI on January 29.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Galaxy S25 leaks don't stop coming as another batch of devices renders surface, which show off every possible color for 2025.</p><p>The leaked batch of Galaxy S25 colors reportedly surfaced via an email from known X tipster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://substack.com/@evleaks/notes">Evan Blass</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/16/samsung-galaxy-s25-color-leak/">9to5Google</a>). It was stated that the tipster provided images for every S25 phone color; however, it appears void of the specific names of these colors. Regardless, the leak kicks off with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which will allegedly offer consumers four colors once it launches.</p><p>The renderings display the phone in black, white, a light or grayish blue, and gray.</p><p>Also, the images give us an uninhibited look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design">subtle design changes</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, such as its rounded corners, black ring camera lenses, and thin display bezels.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is next, as the leak shows off four colors for this device. Blass' imagery shows off the phone in light blue, mint, darker (or navy) blue, and gray options. The leak contained the alleged colors for the base Galaxy S25, as well; however, it will seemingly share the same palette as its Plus sibling.</p><p>While we're showing off a few options here, the full gallery can be viewed at 9to5.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the publication speculates that the recent leak by Evan Blass isn't the full scope of Samsung's Galaxy S25 reveal. There's reportedly a chance that the company could have a few "Samsung Store Exclusive" options up its sleeve. This <em>seems </em>likely, especially considering the company's past. In 2024, the Samsung Store brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/ph/mobile/mobile-phone-buying-guide/galaxy-s24-colors/">three exclusive options</a> for the S24 Ultra: Titanium Blue, Titanium Green, and Titanium Orange.</p><p>The S24 and S24 Plus saw the same colors, but they were named Sapphire Blue, Jade Green, and Sandstone Orange.</p><p>While the tipster's recent leak seemingly surfaced without the potential color names, another leak — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-series-rendering-design-leak">that revealed the series' renders</a> — included some monikers. The Galaxy S25 Ultra could see options like Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silver Blue, and Titanium White Silver. The other two siblings may see Silver Shadow, Ice Blue, Navy, and Mint. These renders surfaced shortly after a discovery was made about the (alleged) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-series-specs-leak">specification sheet</a> for the flagship trio.</p><p>Elsewhere, a Thailand-based retailer slipped up this week and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-case-surface-early-retail-listing-leaked">posted the cases for the Galaxy S25 series</a> far too early. The shop quickly rectified its mistake, but not before a screenshot got out to the public. It seems Samsung is preparing to bring its "Standing Grip Case" for the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Plus models, as well as some basic silicone cases.</p><p>The next flagship series will debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">on January 22</a> during Unpacked.

<ul><li>Google has partnered with a renowned online news organization, the Associated Press, to help Gemini provide a feed of real-time information.</li><li>This is an attempt to explore the benefits of AI while partnering with news ecosystems to help strengthen journalism and reduce misinformation, Google says.</li><li>Not much information about how this partnership will play out has been divulged, but it seems likely that AP's news content will be integrated into Gemini's responses.</li></ul>

<p>Google is trying to expand Gemini's skill set so that the app can provide accurate and timely information for those who need it. For the first time, it has partnered with a news organization that will help deliver up-to-date news on the Gemini app.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/news/associated-press-gemini-app/" target="_blank">Keyword announcement</a>, Google said it has decided to collaborate with the Associated Press (AP), which will now deliver a feed of real-time information to "enhance the usefulness of results displayed in the Gemini app."</p><p>This is a step in the right direction for people to start trusting AI-generated content and address concerns surrounding misinformation. Teaming up with a news organization would help Gemini link search results to reliable news stories.</p><p>“We are pleased Google recognizes the value of AP's journalism as well as our commitment to nonpartisan reporting, in the development of its generative AI products," said AP senior vice president and chief revenue officer Kristin Heitmann in the Keyword.</p><p>Google has been striving to help ease users into the idea of AI and has introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-international-fact-checking-day-2024-updates" target="_blank">several tools</a> like 'About this image' and 'About this page'  so that people can find out the source of their search results.</p><p>That said, not much information has been divulged about how this partnership will play out in real time. When we asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, it stated that "AP news content will be integrated into Gemini's responses, giving users access to up-to-date information." Gemini also stated that the initial rollout will focus on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Advanced</a> subscribers.</p><p>“AP and Google’s longstanding relationship is based on working together to provide timely, accurate news and information to global audiences,” Heitmann added.</p>

<p>It isn't the first time that AP has cracked a deal with an AI platform. According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/google-gemini-ai-associated-press-ap-0b57bcf8c80dd406daa9ba916adacfaf" target="_blank">publisher</a>, the organization has been trying to expand its revenue stream in recent years, and in 2023, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/openai-chatgpt-associated-press-ap-f86f84c5bcc2f3b98074b38521f5f75a" target="_blank">signed a deal</a> with OpenAI, enabling the AI company "to license AP’s archive of news stories to train future versions of its AI systems."</p><p>Some argue that monetizing data and information to improve AI's capabilities could take a dangerous turn in the long run. “By outsourcing their value to tech companies, news outlets may cede control over how their work is used,”  Sarah Kreps, a professor and director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute, told AP.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is expanding its Care Plus subscription for your Galaxy devices with another type of unlimited repair.</p><p>As highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/01/15/samsung-care-plus-free-screen-repairs/">9to5Google</a>, the Samsung Care Plus with Theft & Loss package has now rolled out support for "unlimited screen repairs." Per the c<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/samsung-care-plus/">ompany's website</a>, the "unlimited protection" plan now includes "same-day $0 cracked screen and back glass repairs." Samsung adds that users will have access to these repairs at over 700 of its authorized locations. Consumers have the option of mailing-in their devices, as well, per the publication.</p><p>Things aren't as cut and dry as Samsung states the same-day portion of this plan "may be available for eligible devices in <em>select </em>areas." While this plan supports its Galaxy devices like your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24 series</a>, it reportedly does not service the brand's foldable phones.</p><p>The folks at 9to5 were also given a quick note about this Theft & Loss addition, which states Samsung's upcoming Galaxy S25 is eligible for its unlimited screen repairs.</p><p>Samsung's debut of cracked screen repairs applies to Care Plus subscribers <em>without </em>Theft & Loss attached, too. For this, the company states users will have to chuck up a $29 fee at any of its locations for device service. Those with Samsung Care Plus Essentials are left out of this screen repair service.</p>

<p>Expanding the reach of coverage occurred early last year as Samsung announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-care-plus-unlimited-battery-repair-notification">its unlimited battery support</a> for Care Plus subscribers. There was a catch to this as the company stated users will receive repairs so long as there is no "additional damage" <em>and </em>your device is still covered. The battery repair service only applies to users with devices that have a total battery charge capacity under 79%.</p><p>Following the announcement last March, Samsung brought it to its Care Plus subscribers that May. However, it came with an extra $2 charge on their typical monthly bill, per an email.</p><p>The addition lets users walk into several of Samsung's stores for battery repairs. The addition seemed to make sense, especially after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-batteries-plus-expanded-partnership">partnered with Batteries Plus</a>. In 2023, Samsung and Batteries Plus got together to convert 35 stores across the U.S. into Samsung Authorization Service Centers. The work done there enables consumers to get a device fixed in two hours or less.</p><p>In other news, it's nice to see Samsung granting its Galaxy S25 series some support — even though it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">not here until January 22</a>.

<ul><li>WhatsApp announces some new and upcoming features for its Android and iOS platforms.</li><li>The messaging service brings video call effects for traditional photo and video sharing within the chats.</li><li>Users can also share quicker emoji reactions to messages in their respective WhatsApp chats.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp has announced that it is starting 2025 with a bunch of new features coming to Android and as well as iOS users.</p><p>In an accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/new-year-new-ways-to-chat-on-whatsapp">blog post</a> this week, the messaging platform shared some new features and design improvements that users can see on WhatsApp this year. Meta-owned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-messaging-apps">messaging service</a> introduced an effects feature for video calls last year.</p><p>With the new update, people who often take photos and videos in chats will now be able to use those effects. This means users will be able to choose the same 30 backgrounds, filters, and effects to transform what they capture and share in their chats.</p>
<p>WhatsApp on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> already allows users to take selfies and immediately convert them into relevant stickers. This can be done by tapping the create sticker option, which opens up the camera for users to click selfies and create stickers hassle-free. According to the blog post, it is coming soon to iOS users this year.</p><p>The messaging platform will also allow users to easily share their favorite sticker packs right from their chats. Lastly, WhatsApp users will be able to quickly react to a message in a chat by simply double-tapping the respective message and scrolling through the most-used emoji reactions.</p><p>While these seem to be a bunch of new features coming to the platform, WhatsApp notes that it is looking forward to introducing "more exciting features" that are set to be released throughout 2025.</p>

The relevant widget has been spotted recently in the WhatsApp beta <strong>2.25.1.27</strong> version. It is believed to be coming in a 4x1 layout, and users are required to access WhatsApp's AI chat feature to use it.</p><p>Once the widget is enabled, users can tap the text field to start asking Meta AI or use the camera icon in the same widget to click something and ask questions about it.</p>
