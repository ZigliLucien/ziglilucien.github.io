The Google Pixel 10 series has finally launched, and they're the most AI-forward phones we've seen.</p><p>The trip of phones (not counting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>) can be seen as refined versions of the Pixel 9 series, but in the best way possible. Sure, some specs have gone unchanged, and one or two have even been downgraded, but there is a swathe of improvements that make the Pixel 10 series an enticing offering.</p><p>So, should you buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Google Pixel 10</a>? Right now, there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">Pixel 10 preorder offers</a> that won't last very long, especially once the phones hit store shelves on August 28. Here are some reasons why you should and shouldn't buy the Pixel 10, and who should or shouldn't consider one.</p><h2 id="why-you-should-buy-a-pixel-10-2">Why you should buy a Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dtscVtTKfr8HHQWraEzqDS" name="Google-Pixel-10-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dtscVtTKfr8HHQWraEzqDS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a lot to like about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> series, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> takes things up a notch. Design-wise, it's nearly identical, albeit with some slight differences in size and thickness. Yes, in a time when companies are trying to push the boundaries of thinness, the Pixel 10 and 10 Pro are slightly thicker, but for good reason.</p><p>Each model comes with larger batteries, but Google is also the first Android OEM to launch a flagship smartphone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">built-in Qi2 magnets</a>. Previously, the only Android phone with this feature was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> from 2024, so we're pleased that it's finally coming around to more mainstream phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>.</p><p>Qi2 may not seem like a huge deal, but it is. It adds a ton of convenience to wireless charging, ensuring that the alignment is always correct. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">other MagSafe accessories</a> like PopSockets, phone stands, and wallets make the phones more versatile without the need for a case, like on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-03" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnpFPnouK6wRZUu93pnRCQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the new Tensor G5, which is made by TSMC. It's a switch from the previous Samsung-made chips, and it's said to bring some impressive performance and efficiency gains. Beyond that, the Tensor G5 enables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">tons of new AI capabilities</a> for the Pixel 10 series, turning these phones into truly AI-first smartphones.</p><p>For instance, Magic Cue is a feature that presents helpful and contextual information when you most need it, saving you from having to dig for it. Voice Translation for calls is also a handy feature that helps break down language barriers by translating your voice in real-time into one of several languages. The best part is that these features are processed on-device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vMuFmqwtuMuEQAoeLDefLS" name="google-pixel-10-pro-magic-cue-03" alt="Selecting actions with Magic Cue on a Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vMuFmqwtuMuEQAoeLDefLS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new Tensor chip also brings welcome camera improvements and capabilities. I wasn't too impressed with the base Pixel 9 images, so I'm excited to test this out for myself on the base Pixel 10, but features like Auto Best Take and Camera Coach help make it easier than ever to capture better images, even if you're not exactly the best photographer.</p><p>And did I mention the base Pixel 10 now has a triple camera system with a 5x telephoto lens? For the same price as last year's model, the Pixel 10 is now nearly on par with its Pro siblings.</p><h2 id="why-you-shouldn-t-buy-a-pixel-10-2">Why you shouldn't buy a Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AuuE4kSUwazjBbzEwnVESJ" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-03" alt="Comparing the designs of the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AuuE4kSUwazjBbzEwnVESJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 series sounds impressive on paper, but no phone is perfect. We've only had a short hands-on, but with the Pixel 10 series, we already have some reservations based on our limited experience.</p><p>Firstly, Tensor G5 may be an upgrade from its predecessor, but it likely still pales in comparison to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> found in competing phones. That's not even counting the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2</a> (or whatever it's called), so if you're looking for an absolute powerhouse, the Pixel 10 likely isn't the phone you want for 2026.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-sensitive-eyes-pwm-accessibility-feature" alt="The new "adjust brightness for sensitive eyes" PWM-adjustment feature on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8kLzBR3wQtSU6QS9Q3299.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We're happy that Google has finally improved the display for any PWM-sensitive users. However, in our limited testing of this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">new accessibility feature</a>, the Pixel 10 Pro only doubles its PWM rate to 480Hz, which is well below the recommended rate.</p><p>Additionally, the base Pixel 10 doesn't have this feature, so you'd have to spend more money to protect your eyes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3818px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nnY5i9VM2gJHwjysuuVf8X" name="Google-Pixel-10-Obsidian-USB-C-port-and-speakers" alt="Pixel 10d" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nnY5i9VM2gJHwjysuuVf8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3818" height="2148" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's also the matter of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-everything-you-need-to-know-about-esim">eSIM</a>. The Pixel 10 (minus the Fold) follows Apple's example by removing the physical SIM card slot, meaning swapping phones will be more secure, but it won't be as easy. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">We've struggled with eSIM</a> in the past, and even though the technology isn't new, it feels like the systems in place just aren't fully equipped to make the process seamless, especially because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-the-controversial-rise-of-esims-and-why-many-users-have-concerns">it shifts the control to the carriers and OEMs</a>.</p><p>Fortunately, it's only U.S. models that are eSIM-only, but if you don't wanna deal with the potential headache it could bring, then the Pixel 10 might not be for you.</p><h2 id="who-should-and-shouldn-t-buy-the-pixel-10-2">Who should and shouldn't buy the Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uLPAn9TScXoYCDd3PbHAhN" name="Pixel-10-series-boquet" alt="Pixel 10 series shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLPAn9TScXoYCDd3PbHAhN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Given the similarities between the Pixel 10 and its predecessor, I wouldn't really recommend these phones for anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>. If you <em>really</em> care about Qi2 or some of the new AI features enabled by Tensor G5, then perhaps there's reason to upgrade or to buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 over a Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>However, if you own an older Pixel phone, the Pixel 10 is a more worthwhile upgrade. Otherwise, you can forgo some of the newer AI features and buy an older model to save some money. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-8">Pixel 8</a> still has another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-explains-pixel-8-update-promise">five years of software updates to go</a>.</p><p>Things get a little more muddy when you're comparing the Pixel 10 series to other phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which are known to prioritize power and performance. If that's what you're looking for, then a Snapdragon-powered phone may be more your speed.</p><p>The Pixel 10 series is positioned as AI-first phones that want to make everything easy and accessible. If that appeals to you, then the Pixel 10 is for you. The next step is to decide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">which Pixel 10 model you should buy</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company, like all others, makes a new model every year. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait until October to actually have one on your wrist, but there's some really good news to chew on in the meantime:</p><p><strong>It's designed to be user serviceable.</strong></p><p>For a lot of people, this is the best new feature of the Pixel Watch 4. I'm one of them. For others, it doesn't matter as much. Either way, it's important for everyone. Easy for you to fix means it's also easy for someone else to fix.</p><p>We are seeing the same thing from companies making phones, though the progress is slow. If you want a phone you can fix on your dining room table without needing to be some sort of super space-age phone mechanic, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-sustainable-repairable-phones">you can find them</a>. Seeing this on a watch (and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a> case battery is serviceable, too!) wasn't anything I expected to hear about, <em>especially</em> from Google.</p><p>It's simple, really. There are Torx screws on the back of the Pixel Watch 4, and removing them gives you access to both the battery and the display. There is no mountain of glue holding things in place, and once you've bought the parts (which Google will sell and you'll probably be able to order from a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/" target="_blank">iFixit</a>), you can swap them. No fuss, no heat guns, no complicated extra steps or lasers needed.</p><p>The case for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">Pixel Buds 2a</a> is mostly the same. Remove a couple of screws, and you can swap the old, tired battery for a fresh one that will last you a couple more years. It's a good look and makes the products much more desirable, knowing they'll last as long as you want them to last.</p><h2 id="why-repairability-matters-2">Why repairability matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xHWrPWWhbVeJdUTnyDDamE" name="framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-review-included-screwdriver.jpg" alt="Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition screwdriver on top of lid" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHWrPWWhbVeJdUTnyDDamE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Maybe you're <em><strong>not</strong></em> the kind of person who feels confident enough to tear open the back of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">$350 smartwatch</a>. I get that. I will say you should try because when a product is designed to be serviced by the consumer, it's actually pretty easy.</p><p>That's not an accident. You can add your own windshield washer fluid to your car because it was designed to make it easy for you to do so. You might be able to change your air filter or oil if you're handy, as they are also serviceable by the end user. You're not going to change the timing belt on a 2010 Subaru unless you know what you're doing (and you hate yourself).</p><p>Electronics are the same way. Some things are simple to service by design. You can add and remove <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">a screen protector</a> or a protective case. Other things need some experience and know-how, like swapping most phones' batteries. Then there are projects you need to let the professionals handle.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1779px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cR9AGL7cWsVGt8T7PiJ7M" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-servicability" alt="Repairing the Google Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cR9AGL7cWsVGt8T7PiJ7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1779" height="1001" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not feasible to make the whole thing easy for you to tear apart in your living room.

If you're never going to fix your smartwatch yourself, you might think that doesn't matter. It does.</p><h2 id="save-some-money-too-2">Save some money, too</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3577px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-band-connector" alt="Pixel Watch 4 band connector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RxhtQjmhZM529iZkdBnrWb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3577" height="2012" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a perfect world, I would live in Fiji and fix electronics for a living, getting rich doing what I love. If you brought me a smartwatch because the battery won't hold a charge, I would be able to fix it.</p><p>Chances are, it wouldn't be easy, and I would charge you for the extra time it takes to get inside and the time it takes to track down those pesky parts, in addition to the cost of the new battery. Your $350 smartwatch ended up costing $200 to fix.</p><p>If you brought me a Pixel Watch 4 and I could get the part shipped to me, then spend 20 minutes with a screwdriver when they arrived, I'm going to charge you for the parts and an hour's labor.</p><p>When you don't have to lay out almost the same amount of money for a repair as it takes to buy a new product, you might do it more often. Fewer smartwatches end up in landfills as e-waste, less lithium and cobalt need to be mined, and you get to save money. The only losers are the seagulls and crows who love those huge, smelly landfills.</p><p>Google doing this with a flagship product like the Pixel Watch 4 is a really big deal. This may not be the first wearable that tech-inclined people could work on, but it's the first one designed to be easy for everybody. Selling the parts and making it easy is a big step, and it makes the Pixel Watch 4 one of the best wearables you can buy before anyone even gets a chance to use one.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="34c7453b-18cd-4353-834e-4d0e210a0344">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dH2wc4MeYB6S44EAF9CGnG.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Fix it yourself</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is the latest smartwatch from Google, and it's the first Pixel Watch that users can repair themselves, thanks to some thoughtful design changes.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

For one thing, you certainly can't use glass inside, restricting you to only flexible plastic films. However, most foldable phone brands advise against swapping out the factory-installed internal screen guard yourself unless it's absolutely necessary.</p><p>The choice is yours, but it doesn't hurt to buy a multi-pack and have spares lying around when you need them. This is more useful, rather than waiting around for an accident to happen and then taking action. This is why the Milomdoi 9 in 1 Screen Protector is the optimal choice for any Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold owner. It includes it all — two installation frames to make the alignment and installation effortless and smooth, three sets of tempered glass screen protectors for the outer screen, three sets of darkened glass camera lens protectors, three self-repairing TPU films for the insides of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and a cleaning kit. Milomdoi includes a handy QR code on the instruction manual that leads you to a step-by-step instruction video for installation, which is a neat little touch.</p><p>If you want to stick with just an external screen protector for your Google foldable, then there are plenty of choices as well. Depending on the price range you're gunning for, you can score something ultra-durable from ZAGG for $60 or settle for an upper-mid-ranger like Spigen's crack-proof GlasTR EZ FIT two-pack. And if you're planning on using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-cases">phone case with your Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, you can always opt for the premium Dbrand Pixel 10 Pro Fold Prism 2.0 (Case Friendly) 2-Pack Screen Protector for $35.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All 6.8 inches of this lofty Android phone need some extra protection, because replacing that OLED will cost you a pretty penny. That's where the best Google Pixel 10 Pro XL screen protectors come in. You can opt for a glass screen protector or something more flexible, like a TPU film or a hybrid film. Each kind of screen protector has its own virtue. There are newer types of glass as well, such as alumina glass.</p><p>Choosing the right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> screen protector depends on what sort of fortification you're looking for. For example, tempered glass adds shatter-proofing, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272884218307338">studies published by Ceramics International</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23620">Scientific Reports</a> have found that alumina glass has higher crack resistance. However, plastic films like TPU are thinner and bendable, so they can deliver quicker touch response and cover curved edges better than glass. Many films also self-repair small abrasions. Regardless of the type, here is every type of excellent screen protector that you can buy for your super-sized Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><h2 id="ward-off-cracks-and-shatters-with-these-rock-solid-pixel-10-pro-xl-screen-protectors-2">Ward off cracks and shatters with these rock solid Pixel 10 Pro XL screen protectors</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="c676586a-ad5f-4259-b7f8-ec172a2eb88f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MwuYo6g8o4JHRVw9hLGQsP.jpg' alt="IMBZBK 3 Pack Screen Protector for Google Pixel 10 Pro XL"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">IMBZBK 3 Pack Screen Protector for Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>IMBZBK's 3 Pack Screen Protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a hard-to-beat deal for under $10.

Screen guards are largely of two main categories: glass and plastic. But as I mentioned earlier, there are so many different types within these categories as well. Generally speaking, most people either get a tempered glass or soft TPU film and call it a day. But now you can get alumina glass protectors, hybrid films, and more! The industry continues to innovate.</p><p>So, how do you pick the perfect screen guard? Think about what level of protection you want and what sort of finish pleases you. Glass replicates the feel of the phone's display better, but plastic films are often thinner. Plastic can also bend as it is flexible in nature, allowing it to wrap around the curved edges of phone screens better. Since the Pixel 10 Pro XL has flat sides, this isn't an issue in this case.</p><p>For most people, a three-pack like the one from IMBZBK is an ideal match. You get three sets of military-grade tempered glass screen guards as well as three dark camera lens protectors made of the same kind of glass. These protectors repel dirt, fingerprints, and other debris. IMBZBK also includes comprehensive cleaning and installation kits. All this for under $10 gives you superb value for your money.</p><p>If you're looking for premium quality shatter or crack-proofing, Spigen's GlasTR EZ FIT Tempered Glass Screen Protector is a great choice. It's made of AluminaCore, or what is more commonly known as alumina glass. Spigen's version has undergone chemical reinforcement that really doubles down on crack resistance. For a high-quality screen protector, the $20 isn't half as bad, especially when you look at the $60 ZAGG XTR4 in comparison. Sure, it's fortified by graphene (one of the most durable materials in the world), but that price is way too high for a normal person to spend on a single screen protector. Unless you're made of money or willing to splurge, stick with the Spigen option.</p><p>Add an additional layer of bodily protection by going the extra mile. This involves purchasing one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-cases">best Google Pixel 10 Pro XL cases</a> to prevent damage to the device from any angle, not just the display.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While chatting with Jimmy Fallon during the Made by Google event, Osterloh said Gemini "is coming to your car, to TV, and to your smart speaker, and smart display in the home" sometime this year in the fall.</p><p>Osterloh added, "It's going to be everywhere. It's gotta be everywhere that you are."</p><p>Of course, Osterloh slipped in another quick teaser, but this time it's about Google creating smart glasses with Gemini at its center. Osterloh didn't give specifics about when we could see Gemini's arrival in these places. The "fall" gives us the remainder of Q3 and two-thirds of Q4 2025 (October and November). Hopefully, we see Gemini rollout sooner rather than later. Either way, at least we have a general timeframe to look out for.</p><h2 id="bits-of-teasers-here-and-there-2">Bits of teasers, here and there</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KfcgMVRmmaxfaFyxaaFsm" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfcgMVRmmaxfaFyxaaFsm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Gemini coming to smart speakers and displays teaser goes hand-in-hand with Google's other teaser during the event: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-google-ai-surprise-bring-powerful-household-assistance">a brand new speaker</a>. It was during a quick cameo segment with Lando Norris, where he was speaking with Gemini through a new Google speaker with a colorful blue and purple changing ring light beneath it. While so much more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/leak-suggests-googles-mystery-smart-speaker-may-debut-in-four-colors">has supposedly surfaced</a> about this unreleased product, Google gave it a proper name.</p><p>Soon after, Google posted about "Gemini for Home," its plan to bring the AI model directly into its smart home ecosystem. The company states users can prepare for a "more powerful assistant" to debut in early access in October. Google states Gemini's helpfulness improves, allowing users to do away with "rigid commands" when speaking to it. Gemini Live is also heading to smart home devices, and Google states users need only say "Hey Google" once before speaking to it naturally without the wake phrase.</p><p>When it comes to Android Auto, Brady Snyder, a contributor here at Android Central, had a chance <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/i-tried-a-google-built-in-car-and-its-a-sneak-peek-at-gemini-on-android-auto">to try out the experience</a> during I/O 2025. Essentially, Gemini's inclusion in cars turns your phone from a necessity to an "option." Gemini's ability to understand what you're saying naturally only amplifies its usefulness when you're trying to turn on your defroster or raise the A/C when it's hot.</p><p>Even then, Google teased that Gemini was headed to cars "later this year," and it looks like fall is where we should look.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, it did so in a way that was less of a spectacle and felt more like a morning talk show. Sure, part of the reason it felt like that was because Jimmy Fallon was the host, but that was really how the overall structure of the "event" felt.</p><p>There are two things that Google proved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/all-the-biggest-announcements-at-googles-pixel-event">during the event</a>. The first of which is that it's clear Google is doing whatever it can to appeal to a wider audience, beyond just releasing cutesy commercials when new phones are announced. The second, might not be as obvious to some, but host Jimmy Fallon proved that the world is ready (and longing) for a foldable iPhone.</p><h2 id="is-this-a-new-google-2">Is this a new Google?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXCXTQIIvM0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The new format of the Pixel 10 launch event was Google's attempt at getting more consumers excited about the latest phones and features. Traditionally, these kinds of launch events are structured without much wiggle room, and maybe sometimes come with a "skit" designed to inform, excite, and showcase. Instead, we were greeted with a surprise early embargo drop, subsequently followed by Google doing its best impression of "The Tonight Show."</p><p>What really drove the point home for me was the actual product showcase portion, where Adrienne Lofton, VP of Global Consumer Marketing at Google, gave us the "CliffNotes" of the new Pixel lineup. It almost felt like one of those morning talk show kitchen segments, with Lofton talking about everything that Google's been cooking up. Google took the idea of a morning talk show and turned it into a device launch, complete with special guests, mini-skits, and a couple of interviews.</p><p>Fallon and Lofton played off each other quite well, even when the "A Word" was mentioned regarding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>. This is pretty uncommon, and I can't imagine anyone from Samsung or Apple, besides Craig Federighi, even entertaining the idea of participating in something like it. That's to say, kudos to Google for stepping outside of the box, because despite how cringey some of the jokes were, the almost hour and a half long show flew by.</p><h2 id="the-foldable-demand-is-there-just-hiding-2">The foldable demand is there, just hiding</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZoDyVEMmH4ZVaVYTqGpGbE" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-02" alt="The Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZoDyVEMmH4ZVaVYTqGpGbE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With all of that, there was one particular moment that stood out to me, and that's when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> was being shown off. I don't know if it was genuine or not, but Fallon seemed more excited about the Fold than anything else found in the smorgasbord on the table in front of him. For about 30 seconds, it appeared as though he just zoned out while doing nothing but opening and closing the Fold.</p><p>Then Lofton went on to talk about how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable equipped with an IP68 rating</a>, which prompted a bit of <em>forced excitement</em> from Fallon. Without skipping a beat, the very next topic was about Pixelsnap, and how it works "perfectly fine with your Apple MagSafe accessories," to which Fallon responded with "You said the 'A' word." After that, the pair spoke briefly about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a>, which naturally included mentioning the whole Green Bubbles vs. Blue Bubbles trope.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-jade-pixelsnap-ring-unfolded-01" alt="A Pixelsnap Ring attached to the back of the Jade Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udViu8AmGJyoUS8MTqfWuU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of the almost 17-minute segment, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold got about two minutes of the spotlight. While the Fold made sporadic appearances throughout the entire event, it was nothing like the rest of the Pixel 10 lineup and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>That, along with Fallon's aforementioned excitement, feigned or otherwise, just drove home the point that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are still viewed as second-class citizens, albeit more expensive ones. Sadly, I think that will continue to be the case until Apple makes its long-awaited arrival with a foldable iPhone.</p><h2 id="a-storm-might-be-brewing-2">A storm might be brewing</h2><p>Recent headlines might suggest otherwise, with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/us-smartphone-market-q2-2025" target="_blank">Canalys</a> report (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/16/samsungs-us-market-share-apple-rivalry-foldable-phones.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>) sharing that Samsung has seen a surge in market share from 23% to 31% between Q2 2024 and Q2 2025. Another report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/europe-poised-for-foldable-smartphone-growth-on-surge-in-innovation" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a> says foldable phone sales "are growing rapidly, especially for book-type foldables" in Europe.</p><p>Notably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-just-broke-every-z-fold-preorder-record-ever-set-in-the-us">Samsung shared</a> that both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Flip 7</a> demolished pre-order records, "outpacing last year's models by over 25%." The company also revealed that the Fold 7 specifically "is selling nearly 50% faster than the one before it."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-flip-7-mint-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fold 7 and Flip 7 in Mint hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/soTr5M9upbEv8B8hMnHdZE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, Apple's market share has dropped from 56% to 49% over the time frame. Which, paired with Siri basically being the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-teaser-roasts-apple-for-dragging-its-feet-on-siri">laughing stock</a> of on-device assistants, doesn't bode well for a company that has been regarded as the "best" for years. Of course, this is just a relatively small sample size, and it's worth noting that Apple's next iPhone isn't expected to launch until next month.</p><p>This could result in Apple deciding to move up its internal timeline and release a foldable phone to compete with the likes of Samsung, Google, and Motorola. Last month, Mark Gurman of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-20/apple-s-2026-foldable-iphone-samsung-comparison-m5-ipad-pro-dual-front-cameras?embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> claimed that Apple will introduce "its first foldable iPhone at the end of next year." Gurman goes on to say that instead of offering its take on a flip-style foldable, we should be seeing something more along the lines of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Z Fold 7</a>, Pixel 10 Pro Fold, etc.</p><p>Between the foldable market rebounding in a big way at the same time that Apple is seemingly struggling, we could be in store for the perfect storm that takes the form factor into the mainstream. And not just as a footnote.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold-render-Moonstone-tabletop" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,799</del><strong> $1,039 + $350 gift card at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro Fold shows anything, it's that Google is serious about the form factor, introducing just the right amount of upgrades over its predecessor to keep it in competition with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and other foldables. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-256gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8JXSY" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="dbfbce73-0b3f-4fd5-a934-27e0e5c7e70a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: $1,799" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

Instead of two sizes, the Google Pixel 10 series now includes four models. There's a base-model Pixel 10, the "professional" Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the big-screen foldable Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>With a lineup this diverse, there's sure to be something for everyone. There is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Google Pixel 10</a> model in just about every price point, as the offerings start as low as $799 and top out at $1,799 for this year. They're all available for pre-order now, with the three standard Pixel 10 models hitting shelves Aug. 28 and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold debuting later on Oct. 9.</p><p>The number of options and the similarities between them make choosing the right Pixel 10 model to buy a bit tricky. There are consistencies across every device, like the Tensor G5 processor, triple-camera systems, and magnetic Qi2 support. However, there are even more differences.

the starter Pixel, and it's the model everyone should look at first due to its attractive $799 price point.</p><p>This year, Google made the Pixel 10 more like the Pro models by adding a third camera sensor on the rear. It's a telephoto lens capable of delivering 5x optical zoom quality, and it beats competitors in this price bracket, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>. Paired with a 48MP primary shooter and a 13MP ultrawide, there's a lot to like about the base model for 2025.</p><p>The display is 6.3 inches, the same size as the pricier Google Pixel 10 Pro. On the cheaper Pixel 10, the AMOLED display panel has a lower pixel density (422ppi), lower peak brightness rating (3,000 nits), and a less fluid refresh rate (60-120Hz). These are all sacrifices you'll make by choosing the Pixel 10 instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, but frankly, you probably won't notice them in daily use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uEjApC4HcRpgFbwStT52jX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Indigo-Material-3-Expressive-2" alt="Pixel 10 in Indigo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEjApC4HcRpgFbwStT52jX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of design, the Pixel 10 closely mimics the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>. You have a boxy form factor, a screen with rounded corners, and the oval-shaped Pixel camera housing on the back. It's thicker and heavier this year, measuring 8.6mm thick and weighing 204 grams. Personally, I don't like to see base-model phones weigh over 200 grams in 2025 — the Galaxy S25 and iPhone 16 fall way under this threshold. You might be willing to overlook it thanks to the tech inside.</p><p>Like every Pixel 10 model, the standard version has built-in magnets for full Qi2 wireless charging support out of the box. It is missing a few features found on other Pixel phones, though. Notably, this version only has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wi-fi-6e-faq-what-biggest-upgrade-wi-fi-decade-means-you">Wi-Fi 6E</a> support, down from Wi-Fi 7 on the Pixel 9. The starting 128GB storage configuration also uses UFS 3.1 instead of UFS 4.0 on the 256GB variant, so you might want to upgrade.</p><p>With that being said, if you only need the basics and want an exciting smartphone, the Google Pixel 10 is an excellent option.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e57c2e3a-bdb8-48b7-9e41-85bcc007c769">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Indigo"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The base model</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 is the cheapest model you can buy, but don't be fooled — it's closer in line with the Pro models than ever.

A few years ago, smartphone brands all but forced power users to buy gargantuan phones to get the latest features. Fast-forward to the Pixel 10 series, and the Pixel 10 Pro matches the larger Pixel 10 Pro XL in every way but one. (The former only has Qi2 15W support, while the latter has Qi2 25W support thanks to better thermal management.)</p><p>This makes the Pixel 10 Pro the perfect "middle child" of the lineup. It's identical to the standard Pixel 10 in size, to the point that both models can share cases and accessories. That means the Pixel 10 Pro is also 8.6mm thick, but is slightly heavier at 207 grams. Compared to the base model, the Pixel 10 Pro swaps the glossy back for matte glass and the matte rails for polished aluminum ones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4btWcqfHswLNVJXLMcjEb5" name="google-pixel-10-vs-10-pro-obsidian-back-02" alt="Comparing the obsidian colorsways of the Google Pixel 10 with the obsidian Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4btWcqfHswLNVJXLMcjEb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Comparing the Obsidian colorway of the Google Pixel 10 Pro (left) with the Obsidian Google Pixel 10 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously mentioned, the Pixel 10 Pro offers a major display upgrade. Even though it's the same size as the Pixel 10, the "Pro" version has a higher resolution, full 1Hz-120Hz variable refresh rate support, and a higher 3,300-nit peak brightness rating. Best of all, there are new accessibility features that can increase the PWM rate of the Pixel 10 Pro display for people with sensitive eyes.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro still starts with 128GB of storage for $999, but it's configurable up to 1TB and features 16GB of RAM (compared to the Pixel 10's 12GB). The extra available memory could help the Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold pull more performance out of the same Tensor G5 chip.</p><p>Lastly, the Pixel 10 Pro is the cheapest model to include Google's professional-grade camera system. You get a 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultrawide with a 123-degree field-of-view and macro focus, and a 48MP 5x telephoto lens. These are all upgrades over the comparable sensors in the base model. As such, mobile photography fans should pick at least a Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>You should buy a Pixel 10 Pro if you want a compact phone that won't be hard to use with one hand without sacrificing features. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a> and more memory, it's a more future-proofed option than the standard Pixel 10.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5f25e34e-c48b-43dc-93f4-8313b74489e2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The compact flagship</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro crams almost ever Pro XL feature into the same form factor as the standard Pixel 10.

Take everything from the Pixel 10 Pro, add a 6.8-inch display and Qi2 25W support, and you have the Pixel 10 Pro XL. This large device is for people who aren't concerned with weight or portability, and I mean <em>really</em> aren't concerned — the Pixel 10 Pro XL measures 162.8mm x 76.6mm x 8.5mm and weighs 232 grams.</p><p>Google starts the Pixel 10 Pro XL with 256GB of storage, and the phone is priced higher at $1,199 as a result. Just like the smaller Pixel 10 Pro, the XL version can be configured with up to 1TB of storage. It's also available in Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade colorways.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bc3dnmDnc2BSBeY7dJ2zda" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-dock-screensaver-01" alt="Screensaver options when using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bc3dnmDnc2BSBeY7dJ2zda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the big perks that come with picking up the Pixel 10 Pro XL over the other models have to do with battery and charging. The largest slab Pixel packs a 5,200mAh battery capacity, which is a bump from the 5,060mAh battery within the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Crucially, the Pixel 10 Pro XL finally charges faster, supporting 45W wired and 25W wireless.</p><p>Although all the Pixel 10 models support Qi2, the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports Qi2.2, the latest specification of the wireless charging standard that Google helped create.

The designation means you should be able to daily drive the Pixel 10 Pro Fold like any other phone, taking it with you to the park or beach and everywhere in between without damaging it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uezx9akZZwnpRNzgKb93uj" name="google-pixel-10-Pro-Fold-pixelsnap-charger-dock-02" alt="The Google Photos screensaver functionality on a Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold when docked to a Pixelsnap Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uezx9akZZwnpRNzgKb93uj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold greets users with an 8-inch main display that's the same size as its biggest competitor — the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. Unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is slightly thicker than the model it replaces at 10.8mm, not thinner. The Google foldable's 258-gram weight is pretty insane compared to the competition, too.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold's camera system is unchanged, and it sports a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultrawide lens with macro focus, and a 10.8MP 5x telephoto camera. These are all camera lenses that seem to have appeared on other devices, like the Pixel 9a and now the Pixel 10, so they aren't new.</p><p>I find it hard to justify the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold due to its thickness and weight; they just aren't competitive with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. Regardless, you should choose the Pixel 10 Pro Fold if things like Qi2, Material 3 Expressive, and other Google exclusives are absolute must-haves on your foldable.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8126af7b-0301-499c-897d-d0640f627a25">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hQNR3RN8CceV62CE6dqS2e.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best Google foldable</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold iterates on what made its predecessor great while adding groundbreaking features like IP68 dust resistance.

Oura's statement is as follows:</p><p>“Ultrahuman’s lawsuit in India has no merit and is a blatant attempt to distract from their decisive U.S. defeat. The International Trade Commission ruled unequivocally that Ultrahuman infringed on ŌURA’s intellectual property, blocking all of their smart rings—and components—from the U.S. market through exclusion and cease-and-desist orders. This ruling validates not only the strength of ŌURA’s patents, but also our long-term IP strategy. We’ve now established, at the most rigorous levels of review, that ŌURA’s patents are valid and enforceable—precedent that will shape the future of this category. The facts are clear: ŌURA innovates, Ultrahuman imitates.”</p><p>The original article can be read below.</p><p>Ultrahuman has filed a patent infringement case against Finnish rival Oura, claiming that the latest Oura Ring copies key features from its own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a>.</p><p>The core of the dispute centers on the technology inside Oura's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a>. The lawsuit, which was lodged in the Delhi High Court, says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> incorporates patented elements of its design, including how sensors, construction, and onboard processing come together to deliver insights on sleep, recovery, and circadian health.</p><p>The company argues that Oura has been riding on its innovations, especially in women’s health tracking, glucose monitoring, and non-paywalled data features without permission.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QMPcsQfPamP2ZKzBqRvACi" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-on-pointing-finger-2.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air worn on an index finger." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QMPcsQfPamP2ZKzBqRvACi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>An Ultrahuman spokesperson pointed to Oura's broader business conduct as part of the reason for taking legal action. The company referenced past media reports that have criticized Oura's "backroom deals" and described a "pattern of indiscriminate assertion of patent infringement against any and all competitors."</p><p>The spokesperson said the company had “no choice but to defend its innovation,” pointing to previous reports criticizing Oura’s business practices and lawsuits.</p><h2 id="paywall-vs-progress-the-ideology-behind-a-legal-fight-2">Paywall vs. progress: The ideology behind a legal fight</h2><p>The lawsuit highlights a philosophical split in the wearable market. Ultrahuman has built its brand on offering features without a mandatory subscription, a direct contrast to Oura's subscription model. The company argues that replicating innovations only to lock them behind a paywall is "anti-innovation and anti-consumer."</p><p>Ultrahuman has been pushing several industry-first features to differentiate itself. This includes the acquisition of viO Healthtech, which led to a smart ring feature for tracking ovulation with over 90% accuracy.</p><p>It also offers modular add-ons called PowerPlugs, which let users customize their ring with capabilities like AFib detection or specialized modes for shift workers.</p><h2 id="the-fight-for-truly-ownable-health-insights-2">The fight for truly ownable health insights</h2><p>With this lawsuit, Ultrahuman says it isn't just defending a specific patent; it's positioning itself as a defender of open health data and Indian innovation on the global stage.</p><p>The case will be one to watch for anyone interested in the increasingly competitive and valuable wearable health market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You might've missed the bit during Google's Pixel launch yesterday when we got to see a quick sneak at an unannounced mysterious smart speaker that showed up in the Gemini Home demo.</p><p>During <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-google-ai-surprise-bring-powerful-household-assistance">Lando Norris' cameo</a>, a smaller speaker-like object was placed on the table next to him, which looked almost like a squished sphere with a bright Gemini ring light beneath it, which illuminates blue and purple when the AI is speaking.</p><p>While we were all huddled up, thinking this might be an early iteration of Google's Nest Mini, considering Google hasn't launched a new one in a while. A new leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-home-speaker">Android Headlines</a> spills a little more information about Google's smart home device.</p><p>According to the publication, this Gemini-powered home speaker is real and claims to have seen additional images of the speaker, which will be available in four colors: bright red, light green, black, and porcelain.</p><p>"We’d expect the names to be Obsidian, Porcelain, and Jade; the red color we’re unsure of," the website added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nm4McwMYLW6ygs4FPQiE3e" name="Nest-Wifi-colors.jpeg" alt="Four Nest Wifi color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nm4McwMYLW6ygs4FPQiE3e.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-home-speaker-with-built-in-security-features-2">A home speaker with built-in security features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="sW62W76698mZXEuTHocLfY" name="best-smart-speaker-2022-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Best smart speakers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sW62W76698mZXEuTHocLfY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="878" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central / Andrew Myrick)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of design, they say that the speaker might actually end up looking a lot like a bulkier "Apple HomePod Mini," with the light on the speaker that could be placed at the bottom.

The series first got its beginnings in 2016 when the initial Pixel and Pixel XL graced a San Francisco audience. The post states that the first models "established" what it has continued to strive for presently: AI-powered cameras, exclusive features, and a "deeply personalized" Google experience. Those early devices were also much simpler, with smaller cameras and a two-toned aesthetic.</p><p>Dave Sander, vice president of Operations at Google, said, "Smartphones in general are some of the most complex consumer electronic devices you can make." Sander mentioned the complexities engineers and programmers face daily to ensure the next Pixel meets that higher (expected) standard.</p><p>Hardware and software go hand-in-hand, and that's exactly what Google states has led it throughout the Pixel series thus far. While Google states it has continued to raise the bar in terms of its phone material, opting for more "premium materials," the company has also upgraded its camera systems.</p><p>Google says that its Camera Bar has become central to its Pixel design, as consumers recognize it in tandem with the company's design language. Under the hood, users have features like Top Shot, Astrophotography, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a>, Night Sight, Photo Unblur, and much more.</p><h2 id="google-s-tensor-is-the-core-of-pixel-2">Google's Tensor is the core of Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.13%;"><img id="ipWxaaTeDTrRnEW64JSFm" name="google-tensor-official.jpg" alt="Google Tensor Official" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipWxaaTeDTrRnEW64JSFm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="425" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google attributes a bulk of its internal software enhancements to its in-house custom chip, the Tensor. The Pixel 10 series rocks the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-launch">Tensor G5</a>, delivering a large boost to performance, power, but most of all, AI. Shenaz Zack, senior director of product management for Pixel software, states the Tensor SoC is responsible for bringing the Pixel's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-googles-live-translate-feature">Live Translate</a> to life, as well as Clear Calling, Best Take, and more.</p><p>Taking things even further was the Pixel 9 series, which Google states "introduced our first phones with Gemini built-in." The company has pushed forward, adding even more for users with the Pixel 10 series launch in NYC. Google says that the work it continues to do is a continuous callback to what its CEO, Sundar Pichai, said about the initial launch in 2016. Those early Pixels were designed to give users "the best of Google" by their side, and it seems adamant on furthering that narrative.</p><h2 id="google-s-exclusive-features-march-on-2">Google's exclusive features march on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PtkviacJRpDKbddZVi99sV" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-jade-white-02" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro XL compared to the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PtkviacJRpDKbddZVi99sV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the Pixel 10's launch, Google highlighted the many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">game-changing AI feature</a>s users would find, thanks to the Tensor G5 and Gemini. Magic Cue took center stage, woven into the Daily Hub as a user's "personalized digest" of recommended daily actions, calendar reminders, suggested music, and much more. On its own, Magic Cue is an "in-context" AI-based feature that will leverage information when you need it.</p><p>Essentially, it does the hard work for you so you're not swiping between apps all day. If a friend texts you, asking about the flight this weekend, Magic Cue will fetch those details for you without you needing to lift a finger.</p><p>Gemini Live also got an upgrade on the Pixel 10, enabling users to activate their camera so the AI sees what they see. Users can then query about what they're looking at and have Gemini run the search and offer solutions quickly.</p><p>It's worth reiterating that the Pixel 9, which brought in that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">massive camera bump</a>, was, well, <em>massive</em>. At the time, Google's Director of Design for Pixel phones, Claude Zellweger, explained why that was, and the reason was simple: the camera bump is huge because consumers want to take good pictures. Google discussed the interest in wanting to make good on consumer wishes, while also keeping the phone thin—a reality that's hard to do, considering the components necessary for strong camera sensors.</p><p>However, the Pixel's camera bump has become synonymous with its design. Though it's not like we're not used to seeing a camera bump on other flagships.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This pivot implies that Google might be designing its phones specifically to be vehicles for AI—a change from merely integrating AI features into existing hardware.</p><p>Google is pushing the boundaries of its devices by bringing deeper AI integration. Despite keeping its camera specs the same as last year on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL, it seems to be making up for it with tailored AI tools.</p><p>"New AI features, such as “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-launch">Camera Coach</a>”, “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-leak-points-to-major-gemini-boost-on-the-pixel-10-series">Conversational Editing</a>” and “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">Magic Cue</a>”, ensure that you have access to one of the most innovative smartphones available on the market,” said Anthony Scarsella, Research Director at IDC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3713px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="u3qHNazxK3qKq8KbCFc2Ub" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Fitbit-Steps-Tile-blue" alt="Pixel Watch 4 Fitbit Steps Tile in blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u3qHNazxK3qKq8KbCFc2Ub.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3713" height="2089" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It isn't just the phones that got an AI boost this year; the Pixel Watch 4 also arrived, a wearable that serves "AI on your wrist." While it may look exactly like last year's model, Google did make some hardware tweaks to make the smartwatch look premium. It made the interesting choice to include a domed display underneath the glass. It's a very slight curve, but it's noticeable enough.</p><p>"It's clearly meant to accentuate the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/material-3-expressive-is-return-to-form-pixel-watch-4-needs">Material 3 Expressive UI</a> while pushing content as close to the glass as possible," said Android Central's managing editor Derrek Lee in his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on#section-google-pixel-watch-4-curves-and-colors">Pixel Watch 4 hands-on.</a></p><p>Hardware changes aside, IDC's Research Director Ramon Llamas feels that "the real step-up is the personal health coach powered by Gemini designing user-specific fitness plans and providing real-time feedback."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a" name="Pixel-10-all-devices" alt="Pixel 10 series - all devices" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LoUHptPbpx8EsmAQRBc7a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, while Google is making consistent progress with its hardware, IDC feels that the recent devices from the tech company are competitive in terms of both design and price, keeping pace with the rest of the industry.</p><p>"Leveraging Google's AI advancements through Gemini across all products/ecosystems is a big advantage.

Google's knocked it out of the park with the color choices too, as they're both simply fantastic.</p><p>More important than the design are the changes that you won't immediately see. For one, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the first foldable phone to feature an IP68 rating, something that even Samsung didn't achieve with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.

It might not be able to match up with the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it brings Google a closer to the top than we expected.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold not only packs a brand-new TSMC-made Tensor G5 chipset, but the company has also improved the charging speeds and battery capacity of its latest book-style foldable</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold ships with a 5,015 mAh battery, which is an increase of 365 mAh compared to its predecessor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. As for charging speed, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold supports up to 39W fast wired charging with a USB-C cable. This is a massive increase over the 21W charging speed we saw with Google's previous-generation foldable phone.</p><p>According to Google, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> can charge up to 50% in about 30 minutes when using a 30W USB-C charger. The charging time will drop further if you use a 45W USB-C charger recommended by Google.</p><p>This is a massive jump not only because Google has almost doubled charging speeds in one generation, but also because the Pixel 10 Pro Fold offers more than 50% faster charging than its direct competitor, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. The foldable from Samsung still offers only 25W wired charging.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's not all, Google has packed major upgrades into the wireless charging technology as well.

Instead, you can stick your Pixel 10 Pro Fold, similar to an iPhone, on a MagSafe charger.</p><p>Moreover, thanks to Qi2 support, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold also delivers up to 15W wireless charging, double the 7.5W of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. This means wireless charging times should be significantly shorter.

The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is once again the largest flagship Pixel of the lot, which will compete directly with Samsung's plus-sized model.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus has a lot going for it, like a powerful processor, a versatile rear camera system, and a large and bright display, making it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is a bit more pricey than the Galaxy, but still in the same ballpark range, which makes for an exciting plus-sized battle.</p><p>Between the Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Galaxy S25 Plus, which flagship deserves room in your pocket?</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vLNKNQZnoBwVFB6d8Pyhp" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vLNKNQZnoBwVFB6d8Pyhp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> starts at $1,199, which is $100 more than what the 9 Pro XL starts at. Thankfully, the base 128GB storage variant has been scrapped in favor of 256GB. This isn't really a price increase, considering the 256GB variant of the 9 Pro XL already costs $1,199, so Google simply eliminated one variant of the offering. Preorders for the 10 Pro XL run between August 20 and August 28, when it hits store shelves.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a> now starts at $999.99 for 256GB of storage, and $1,119.99 for 512GB. There's no 1TB storage variant here like you'll get with the Pixel. The S25 Plus has been in the market for more than six months, which means it's easier to find a good deal for it during sales or even in general. Samsung has Google beat on the pricing front, at least for now.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4099px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-01" alt="Holding the Galaxy S25 Plus outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mLqS6nAPQoY8AH8jLyXbMW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4099" height="2306" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL looks virtually identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. If you compare them side by side, you'll probably notice a few differences, like the larger camera cutouts on the back or the new polished finish for the side rails. What you'll also notice is the weight, which has actually gone up to 232 grams from 221 grams. This makes the 10 Pro XL way heavier than the 190 grams of the S25 Plus.</p><p>While the dimensions of the 10 Pro XL are nearly the same as the 9 Pro XL, the larger camera bar might still make it tricky to reuse older cases. The 10 Pro XL comes in Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Moonstone is Google's flagship color for this series. The phone is also IP68 rated for dust and water resistance, and it supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on-pixel-10-qi2">Pixelsnap</a>, which allows it to magnetically use Qi2 chargers without a case. The S25 Plus also supports Qi2 charging, but you need a Qi2 case to make it work.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Bc3dnmDnc2BSBeY7dJ2zda" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-dock-screensaver-01" alt="Screensaver options when using a Pixelsnap charger on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bc3dnmDnc2BSBeY7dJ2zda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL keeps the same display as the 9 Pro XL but with higher brightness of up to 3,300 nits. It's a 6.8-inch OLED with a 120Hz refresh rate, 2,992 x 1,344 pixel resolution, and Gorilla Glass Victus 2. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> users should also rejoice as Google has finally addressed this issue by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-new-pwm-accessibility-setting">offering a new accessibility setting</a> which claims to "improve the viewing experience for sensitive eyes." We'll be sure to test this one out in our full review.</p><p>Samsung has always offered somewhat more eye-friendly displays, and the Galaxy S25 Plus features a 480Hz PWM rate. It's a tad smaller at 6.7 inches, but it's equally pixel dense, has a high brightness of up to 2,600 nits, and good scratch protection. The screen is also great for watching content and playing games.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MpXM62kDAmB7BqWmch59yV" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-jade-white-01" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro XL compared to the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpXM62kDAmB7BqWmch59yV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one thing we're all eagerly excited to see is the new Tensor G5 chipset's performance in the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It's this new custom chip that has enabled Google to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">new features like Magic Cue</a>, which is said to proactively offer support like finding a photo that someone from your contacts might request in a message or call. The 10 Pro XL ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box, and will get seven years of OS and security updates.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus is equipped with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy mobile platform</a>, which is the best available for Android phones. It'll be interesting to see how the Tensor G5 compares, so keep an eye out for our Pixel 10 review. There is a difference in RAM too, with the 10 Pro XL getting 16GB while the S25 Plus gets 12GB.</p><p>As expected, the Pixel 10 Pro XL gets new AI features like Camera Coach, which guides you on how to frame your shot, Auto Best Take, and Edit with Ask Photos. The latter feature is great for novice users as it lets you perform edits with simple text prompts. The Galaxy S25 Plus comes with a suite of useful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, too, so choosing one over the other will depend on which ones you find most useful.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 3,300 nits (peak)</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch QHD+ Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.68 wide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Wide, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 ultrawide, AF</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 5x periscope telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>10MP 3x Telephoto, AF, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>12MP (wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Edit with Ask Photos, Auto Best Take, Camera Coach, Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td><td  ><p>HDR Portraits, Selfie AI ISP, Nightography, High-res Macro, High-res Zoom, Log Video</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 25W Pixelsnap wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse-wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and rear glass)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Armor (front glass), Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (rear glass), Titanium</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td><td  ><p>190 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL should win the battle of cameras and battery life when compared to the Galaxy S25 Plus. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has the same camera hardware as its predecessor, which includes a 50MP main, 48MP telephoto, and a 48MP ultrawide camera on the back. However, the new Tensor G5 chip and updated ISP could lead to improvements in image quality for stills and video. We'll know for sure once we've tested it.</p><p>The S25 Plus has a solid 50MP primary camera, but the other two (10MP and 12MP) won't be able to capture the same level of detail as the Pixel.</p><p>The 10 Pro XL should also last longer than the Samsung, per charge, thanks to a larger 5,200mAh battery capacity. There's faster wired charging than before, and you get Pixelsnap magnetic Qi2 wireless charging as well. As noted before, the Galaxy S25 Plus can do Qi2 charging, but only with a compatible case.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-which-one-is-the-best-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus: Which one is the best?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="oLxWS9acF2aJYRHjXNGB7G" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-moonstone-pixelsnap-ring-02" alt="A Google Pixelsnap ring attached to the back of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL via Qi2 magnets" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oLxWS9acF2aJYRHjXNGB7G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Plus are both expensive phones at the end of the day, and if you've decided to buy either of them, I don't see price being a major deciding factor. I'd put my money on the Pixel 10 Pro XL simply because it's newer, will get day-one Android updates directly from Google, and its cameras and battery life would be better than Samsung's. Plus, I do like the design way better than the Galaxy, but that's subjective.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is a good value and will continue to get updates for the next seven years. It's also lighter and slimmer than the Pixel, which could swing a lot of votes in its favor. Keep in mind that it will be yesterday's news in a few months, and it's likely that not all Galaxy AI features will be free to use by the end of 2025.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3bb2d9ca-466d-4901-899b-e1c624b1fb74">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqN3pGWhvYZ3efgi2qeup9.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A promising upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is an enticing Android phone due to the Tensor G5 platform shift, larger battery, native Qi2 charging, and cool new features.

While the Google Pixel 2 was a major leap over the original, the Google Pixel 4 has arguably done more over the last two years. Google's newest Pixel Watch 4 packs a brighter, domed display with a slimmer bezel, helping the Wear OS smartwatch feel more modern than ever.</p><p>If you have a Google Pixel Watch 2, the latest Pixel Watch 4 might feel like a compelling upgrade. There's a lot to like, although the core experience hasn't changed much. For those who are considering a switch, let's break down how the Pixel Watch has changed over the past two generations.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-2-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 2: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4170px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="dNr8MryxWKWnpWVNjxqQwc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-colors-and-sizes" alt="Pixel Watch 4 sizes and colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dNr8MryxWKWnpWVNjxqQwc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4170" height="2346" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a design perspective, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a> is about as similar to and as different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> as it could be. Here's what I mean — from the outside, the 41mm configurations are identical, weighing the same 31 grams and measuring the same 12.3mm thick. However, the Pixel Watch 4 comes in two sizes, compared to the Pixel Watch 2's singular size, which some find too small. The displays underneath each smartwatch's Gorilla Glass 5 covering are also completely different.</p><p>Part of the idea behind the Google Pixel Watch's sloping, waterdrop design was originally to hide the device's relatively large black bezels. That's evident on the Pixel Watch 2, which has a small and old 1.2-inch AMOLED display panel. It does support 1-60Hz variable refresh rates, but its brightness rating is merely 1,000 nits, hardly enough for reliable outdoor use. It's also a flat display panel under curved glass, which directly contrasts with the Pixel Watch 4's screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8A2EkfHkPRouMaNEEbTjE6" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-2-fitbit-workout-ui-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Watch 2 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8A2EkfHkPRouMaNEEbTjE6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google kept the domed Gorilla Glass 5 covering on the Pixel Watch 4, but now added a domed OLED display to match. It's called Actua 360, and it features a slight curve to match the shape of the smartwatch itself. The hardware is improved, too. It keeps the Pixel Watch 2's variable refresh rate support, but triples its peak brightness rating.</p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 can crank itself up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness when needed, significantly increasing its visibility outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-charger-misaligned-indicator" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on a charger indicating that the alignment is off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other notable change is the charging system. Both the Pixel Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 4 use charging pins instead of a wireless puck, but they're in different locations on each watch. The Pixel Watch 2 has them on the back with the sensor modules, whereas the Pixel Watch 4 positions them on the side. This fits into a new charging dock that utilizes the display while powering the smartwatch up.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-2-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Pixel Watch 2: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3248px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-sensors" alt="Pixel Watch 4 sensors on the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwNzwni9pwToyWLQmkMZYb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3248" height="1827" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 includes a new Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor, but don't get too excited. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">real-world experience will likely be similar </a>to using the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 in the Pixel Watch 2. One big addition that comes with the newer model with Qualcomm's latest wearable chip is on-watch satellite connectivity. That means you can get help in an emergency even if you don't have your phone nearby or LTE service on your Pixel Watch 4.</p><p>Otherwise, performance is mostly the same, and you get identical 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage on each watch. The Pixel Watch 4 does have a new Cortex M55 co-processor specifically tuned for certain tasks. By shifting tasks like AI queries off the primary chip, the Pixel Watch 4 can use less battery and prioritize efficiency. It's a big move as Gemini becomes the primary wearable assistant for the Pixel Watch.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display </p></td><td  ><p>41mm or 45mm</p><p>Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display</p><p>3,000 nits, 1-60Hz refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch, AMOLED</p><p>1,000 nits, 1-60Hz refresh rate</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, Cortex M55 co-processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon W5, Cortex M33 co-processor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection </p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum case</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum case</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity </p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (optional), dual-frequency GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic, Satellite SOS, </p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.0 Wi-Fi, NFC, 4G LTE (optional), GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Compass, altimeter, barometer, magnetometer, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, multi-path optical heart rate sensor, cEDA, SpO2, ECG, far field skin temperature sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Accelerometer, altimeter, ambient light, cEDA, compass, ECG, gyroscope, magnetometer, optical heart rate, skin temperature, SpO2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 325mAh, 30 hours with AOD, 48 hours with Battery Saver</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 455mAh, 40 hours with AOD, 72 hours with Battery Saver</p></td><td  ><p>306mAh; 24 hours with AOD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 25 minutes to 80%, 45 minutes to 100%</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 30 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%</p></td><td  ><p>30 minutes to 50%; 43 minutes to 80%; 75 minutes to 100%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM / storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB/ 32GB </p></td><td  ><p>2GB/ 32GB </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS </p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Satin Moonstone (45mm)</p></td><td  ><p>Polished Silver, Matte Black, Champagne Gold</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions / Weight</p></td><td  ><p>12.3mm thick, 31g (without strap)</p></td><td  ><p>12.3mm thick, 31g (without strap)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel Watch 2 lasts only 24 hours with the AOD enabled, while the Pixel Watch 4's 41mm model can finally hit 30 hours.

The new Pixel Watch 4 addresses a few of our gripes with older models, such as GPS accuracy and the availability of non-running workout tools.</p><p>Google added dual-band GPS to the Pixel Watch 4, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-4-dual-band-gps-exclusive-interview">should greatly improve tracking accuracy</a>. Additionally, there are more than 40 workout modes available in the Pixel Watch 4. New features like Fitbit Morning Brief will keep you up-to-date on your fitness and health progress on a daily basis.</p><p>At their core, the fitness and health features are powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

Both watches are software-supported for three years after their release, with routine feature drops in tow. However, it's worth noting that the Pixel Watch 2 could lose software support in October 2026.

Under the hood, there are a handful of new changes that'll make the Google Pixel Watch 4 more enjoyable to use daily. The biggest visual difference is the new domed OLED display and slimmer bezels, which should aid usability, too.</p><p>Is that enough to make Pixel Watch 2 users upgrade? I'm not so sure. While I find the older model's large bezels and relatively small display to be unsightly, not everyone will. As such, the upgrade from the 41mm Pixel Watch 2 to the 41mm Pixel Watch 4 might not be that enticing. However, if you're hanging onto a Pixel Watch 2 and want to give the 45mm Pixel Watch 4 a try, I think that's a much easier upgrade to justify.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fac998ed-78f9-4510-a36f-3c9a27179901">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YWKDPKpC7M992KeWUNcbF.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Nearing final form</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the evolution of the Pixel Watch 2 that's two years in the making.

Only a few rare finds cost anything more than that — such as the high-end ZAGG hybrid screen protector — but that is an exception.</p><p>You don't have to shell out big bucks to get the best quality of screen protection for your Pixel 10 Pro. Even the best overall pick costs just $10 for a three-pack, packing unbelievable value. The FANGTIAN 3 Pack Screen Protector for Google Pixel 10 Pro comes with a user-friendly installation frame with automatic dust elimination that takes mere seconds to execute. Each of the three tempered glass screen protectors boasts 9H hardness, promising durability and shatter-proofing. FANGTIAN intentionally avoided full-screen coverage with its screen protectors so you can easily use it with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-cases">Google Pixel 10 Pro case</a>.</p><p>Premium alternatives include the ZAGG Glass XTR4 Blue Light Screen Protector as well as the more affordable Spigen GlasTR EZ FIT Tempered Glass Screen Protector for the Pixel 10 Pro. ZAGG's offering is super high-quality, but it costs a whopping $60, which I find absurd. Spigen's GlasTR EZ FIT is a lot more reasonable, priced at about $20 for a two-pack. Spigen enhanced the quality of its screen protector glass with something called AluminaCore glass, so you know the shatter-proofing and impact resistance is worth your while.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google AI Ultra subscribers in the U.S. are receiving the agentic capabilities via a new Labs experiment that has the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">Project Mariner</a> software working in the background. At the core of this update, Google states AI Mode can now help subscribers in this test "find restaurant reservations."</p><p>Google states users can get specific, asking AI Mode to find them a dinner reservation that can accommodate a certain number of people (say, three, for example) at a certain time (like, 6:30 PM, Friday). The post adds that users can also tell AI Mode to consider a specific style of food, as well.</p><p>AI Mode is said to scour the web for you, surfacing a wide variety of available restaurants that fit everything you've told it to be aware of. Google adds that the reservations AI Mode returns (availability) will be in real-time, meaning those times <em>should </em>be as accurate as possible.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:622px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.46%;"><img id="nQEckqkNAUfT82xzxRVTSJ" name="google-ai-mode-search-reservations-test" alt="AI Mode gets a new test, allowing users to ask about dinner reservations with details about the number of people involved and the type of food preferred." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQEckqkNAUfT82xzxRVTSJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="622" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.33%;"><img id="EPBfjETjwnJmEfpBpTqTSJ" name="google-ai-mode-search-reservations-signup-example" alt="Google's AI Mode brings a test that lets users ask the AI for available dinner reservations and signup for them via Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EPBfjETjwnJmEfpBpTqTSJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="601" height="597" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>While this initial test is only available for making dinner plans, Google says it hopes to expand AI Mode's capabilities to appointments and events. It reports that AI Mode is leveraging information, thanks to Google's partnerships with OpenTable, Resy, Tock, Ticketmaster, StubHub, and more.</p><p>Joining this AI Mode experiment is the ability for users to receive "tailored" results based on their preferences. These results begin only for food-related (dining) queries. If you've previously searched for food before, Google states AI Mode will leverage those past conversations to help find spots you may enjoy. This data is taken from what AI Mode remembers about you, which Google says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/search-personalization">can be tinkered with</a> at any time.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-heads-to-canada-2">AI Mode heads to Canada</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.09%;"><img id="wPN44pP9HWVvBtXvWQGAFT" name="google-ai-mode-search-link-sharing-messages" alt="Google's AI Mode receives a link-sharing update, that lets users share their conversations with the AI to others, which, in turn, lets that person continue the conversation on their own with the AI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wPN44pP9HWVvBtXvWQGAFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="920" height="516" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google is also bringing more users into the world of AI Mode in Search.

Among those global rollout is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-ca/products/explore-get-answers/google-search-introducing-ai-mode-in-canada/">AI Mode's availability in Canada</a>. Similar to around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">the time of AI Mode's U.S.</a> launch, Canadian users will have the ability to lean on the feature for more "complex" topics. These subjects can include how-to guides or help with planning a vacation.</p><p>Additionally, Canadian users can even have AI Mode create a table packed full of information about "the differences in taste, ease of use, and equipment needed" when wanting to brew coffee from home. More than that, Canada's AI Mode launch brings a multimodal experience, says Google. Now, users can open AI Mode in Search on their phones, activate their cameras, and ask the feature about what they're looking at.</p><p>Alternatively, you could upload a photo and ask AI Mode that way.</p><p>Elsewhere, users in the U.S. will begin to find today (Aug 21) and through the end of the week is a new link-sharing feature for AI Mode. Google states users can enter a search discussion with AI Mode and then share a link for others to see its results. Moreover, the people you've shared the link with will be able to essentially "pick up where you left off," gaining the ability to pose their own follow-up questions to the AI.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/16517651">can control</a> their shared links and delete them as necessary.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">dropped a major AI Mode update</a> in July, basically turning into your personal assistant, capable of placing calls in your stead. The AI can call businesses for you, asking about appointment details, times, pricing, and more.

I expect plenty of people will balk at buying smart glasses with "only" one display. But having tried both monocular and binocular smart glasses, I think Meta is making the right decision — and Google would agree with me.</p><p>The original Google Glass had a monocular display, and a decade later, when I tried <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google's Android XR reference design at I/O 2025</a> (see the photo above), they had only one display. This isn't a coincidence!</p><p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth explained why monocular smart glasses are so much easier to create during an August AMA (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/why-metas-first-hud-glasses-will-have-a-monocular-display/">UploadVR</a>): "They're affordable, they're lighter, and you don't have disparity correction, so they're structurally quite a bit easier."</p><p>Switching to binocular displays "more than doubles the cost" because, on top of a second display and eye-tracking camera, you have to ensure perfect interpupillary distance and prevent any disparity between what the user's two eyes see.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eNrHWzPZ6BfbpiFaSW4k65" name="meta-project-orion-ar-glasses-hands-on-06.jpg" alt="Photo of Nick Sutrich wearing and using the Meta Orion AR glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eNrHWzPZ6BfbpiFaSW4k65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's why Meta's monocular Hypernova glasses can (allegedly) cost less than a grand and blend in as somewhat "normal" glasses. Would people care as much about them if they cost $2,000?</p><p>Meanwhile, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion prototype</a> needs thicker frames for the extra power and battery demands of two large displays. And while Orion's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/meta-significant-cost-reduction-orion-ar-lenses/">$10,000 cost</a> mostly comes down to silicone carbide lenses, that cost would be more than halved with one display.</p><p>The concern with a monocular display is "binocular rivalry," Bosworth says, because "one eye is seeing something, the other eye isn't seeing it, and your brain has to reconcile that, and different people experience that very differently."</p><p>But again, having tried Google's latest monocular glasses, I'm mostly unconcerned.

Smart glasses <em>need</em> to look good and familiar, or not enough people will wear them to make money. The thicker they get, the harder it is for people to see the resemblance.</p><p>Most importantly, smart glasses need to function <em>without</em> a display. Assistants like Meta AI and Gemini will be your primary controller and source of information, with the display there to show their data in a more accessible way. So adding a second display, which will drain your battery life more quickly until you can't access the assistant at all, is a poor allocation of resources. Smart glasses can only replace normal glasses if they're worth wearing all day, not just at odd moments.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FB8Wd75MmjgS9iYwZ56yKZ" name="Android-XR-Messages" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will look on smart glasses, showing a Google Messages pop-up from Sasha "Hey, just got here and grabbed a table" in front of a city street view, with a "Gemini reply" to the message in the corner." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FB8Wd75MmjgS9iYwZ56yKZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, Google's monocular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> glasses genuinely impressed me, proving that a display can be subtly helpful. You get a seamless pop-up showing Gemini answers to questions, calendar entries, recent Messages, live translations, and other data that's easily readable but doesn't take up your entire vision.</p><p>It's like being able to glance down at your smartwatch for a notification, only with a more subtle downward glance. And in fact, the Android XR version of Google Maps shifts from a basic directional guidance to a full-on map when you look downward, signaling to the glasses that you want more information.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRCaghPFFinRdowp73frFZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-1" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with the pop-up "Turn right towards 10th Avenue" direction in view." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRCaghPFFinRdowp73frFZ.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Maybe some people will be more bothered by a monocular display — especially if they're not right-eye dominant — but it felt totally natural, sitting in my vision without any blurring, but not feeling so distracting that I couldn't focus on what's in front of me.</p><p>Binocular AR glasses might make these pop-ups even clearer, but they'll have to reconcile the image in the center of your vision, and while that's great for extended displays for gaming or streaming while you lay in bed, I don't know how much more helpful it'll be outdoors when you're walking around.</p><p>That's why I think monocular smart glasses are the best way to introduce this tech to wider audiences. It's simpler to pull off, and you don't need to worry as much about things like interpupillary distance when trying to give people a clear test demo.</p><p>So long as Meta, Google, and the rest remember that about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/dominant-eye">30% of people are left-eye dominant</a> and sell a smaller portion of left-display glasses, I don't think people will have any trouble adapting to monocular smart glasses. Either that, or they'll just keep buying normal smart glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 3s</a> that don't even need a display.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Prioritize what it is that you seek from a screen protector, whether it's case-friendliness, shatter-proofing, or fingerprint repellence. I also encourage looking into whether or not you want a front camera cutout in your Pixel 10 screen protector.</p><p>The TOCOL Google Pixel 10 Pro Screen Protector/Google Pixel 10 Screen Protector 2 Pack checks all the right boxes. For an amicable price, you get an auto-alignment positioning frame with dust removal and instant adhesion technology. Each of the two tempered glass protectors boasts hardness levels above 9H for military-level drop and impact resistance. And to add to all that, the cutout-free TOCOL tempered glass protectors repel fingerprints and dust. It's the complete package for less than $15.</p><p>ZAGG offers a more premium alternative with its Glass XTR4 Blue Light Screen Protector for the Pixel 10. Although it's a bit expensive at $60, you get a robust screen protector that's fortified with graphene. It has a unique hybrid makeup, bringing glass-like shatter-proofing along with smudge-proofing to your Pixel 10's OLED display. ZAGG's offering also filters out blue light emissions and comes with an anti-dust adhesive and EZ Apply installation tray in the box.</p><p>Screen protectors have a key role to play in terms of long-term care for your Pixel 10's display.

Honor states it's collaborated once more with Prof. Jimmy Choo, OBE for a limited edition variant of the phone inspired by the "subtle shimmer of crystals." This sparkling V Flip 2 invokes the colors of "crushed stardust" in the sea.</p><p>The company states it wants the Magic V Flip 2 to feel more like a "luxury accessory," as consumers pair it with a leather sling or pearl strap. Consumers will notice a 4-inch cover display and a large 6.8-inch internal, foldable display. Camera-wise, consumers will find that the dual camera array on the V Flip 2 is the same size, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v-flip-china-launch">unlike the original model</a>, which had a larger main camera cutout against a smaller ultrawide cutout.</p><p>However, the Magic V Flip 2 takes its photography even more seriously this time around, providing a 200MP main camera with f/1.9 aperture and a 50MP ultra-wide-angle macro lens. This is an upgrade that truly tops the 50MP, 12MP pairing the first iteration had. Users will also have a 50MP selfie camera once again at f/2.0 aperture.</p><p>Honor states it's fueled even more of its AI algorithms into the V Flip 2 to make a phone that's proficient in selfies.</p><h2 id="honor-ai-for-its-cameras-daily-tasks-2">Honor AI for its cameras & daily tasks</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="qDgCo4YsfupDw2GRVrXCtk" name="honor-magic-v-flip-2-crystal-limited-edition" alt="The Honor Magic V Flip 2's limited edition crystal version in China." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDgCo4YsfupDw2GRVrXCtk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the press release, the Magic V Flip 2 is "designed as the ultimate selfie device." The device reportedly hauls in a new feature: Ultra-Wide Portrait mode with natural bokeh. Not only does the V Flip 2 deliver several filter options for your photos, but it also offers five focal lengths, ranging from 0.5x to 3.0x. Honor is highlighting the capabilities of its cover display's main and ultra-wide lens, which users can use for selfies, as the cover display delivers a unique preview experience.</p><p>The AI Honor Image Engine helps to improve user photo quality once taken. AI Super Zoom enables even greater, up-close shots, up to 30x when using the main 200MP sensor. Additionally, other AI tools, such as AI Edit, Passers-by Eraser, Open Eyes, AI Cutout, and AI Upscale, further Honor's commitment to the user's post-production experience.</p><p>Away from the camera, Honor states its AI focus delivers one-click smart reply, AI Interpreter, Magic Capsule, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">AI Deepfake Detection</a>.

Honor states this silicon-carbon battery is built to enhance the foldable's endurance throughout the day, so you're not always attached to your charger. As such, the Flip 2 delivers 80W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and 7.5W reverse wireless capabilities.</p><p>The phone is available in a 16/1TB (RAM/storage) configuration for its crystal-inspired limited edition. However, Honor states consumers can also find the device available in purple, white, and grey, naturally. Those three variations feature the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 12/TB.</p><p>The Honor Magic V Flip 2 will be available for purchase in China, beginning on August 28, with a starting price of 5,999 yuan (~$835).</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's hard to say, but I certainly wouldn't buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro without a great preorder deal attached. </p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-series-announcement-quick-links-2">Google Pixel 10 series announcement -- quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/live/made-by-google-live-blog-2025-pixel-10-pixel-watch-4-android-16-and-gemini"><strong>Made by Google 2025:</strong> LIVE updates and everything you need to know</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-hands-on"><strong>Google Pixel 10 hands-on:</strong> A bigger upgrade than you think</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on"><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold hands-on: </strong>The world's first dustproof folding phone</a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on"><strong>Google Pixel Watch 4 hands-on:</strong> AI on your wrist</a><br><br><em><strong>The best Google Pixel 10 deals (so far)</strong></em></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>FREE Pixel 10 with eligible line</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/google-pixel-10.html"><strong>up to $1,100 off with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-10"><strong>free Pixel 10 with eligible line</strong></a></li><li><strong>Xfinity Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.xfinity.com/mobile/learn/deals"><strong>up to $1,000 off with eligible trade-in, line</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/GoogleLLC/page/080B7645-8292-4117-A6CA-1BF598F3FE26"><strong>Free gift cards with purchase</strong></a></li><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-10-pro-128gb-unlocked-moonstone/J39TC8J8L5"><strong>Free gift cards, trade-in credit</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-deals"><strong>The best Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold preorder deals</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-watch-4-deals"><strong>The best Google Pixel Watch 4 preorder deals</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Vivo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://vivonewsroom.in/press-release/vivo-unveils-first-mixed-reality-headset-and-new-imaging-strategy-at-30th-anniversary/">says</a> it has been working on the product for about four years, and the headset is about the brand's vision of bringing mixed reality from the lab into everyday life.</p><p>At first glance, the Vision Discovery Edition looks very similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a>. You have a glass-covered front with an aluminum frame and a fabric headband. What's different is that Vivo's XR headset is quite light compared to the Vision Pro, measuring just 398g, while Apple's comes in at around 600g. Vivo also says it offers four sizes of light seal and eight foam padding options to ensure an optimal fit.</p><h2 id="2"></h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4udZ7pESF8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>While Samsung's XR headset is expected to be powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, Vivo has used its own OriginOS Vision for the Discovery Edition. Vivo says the UI elements "seamlessly blend in the surrounding space," and the headset supports eye-tracking and fingertip gesture recognition.</p><p>On the hardware front, the Vivo Vision Discovery Edition comes with dual Micro-OLED 8K displays and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chipset</a>. Vivo says the chipset is powerful enough for high-speed rendering in spatial computing.</p><p>The headset can generate up to a 120-foot virtual theater screen, allowing users to watch sports and e-sports broadcasts from multiple angles. Thanks to its split-screen feature, it can also display different games simultaneously.</p><p>Vivo hasn't announced pricing or availability yet, but the company will begin showcasing the headset to users in China starting next week.</p><p>Alongside the launch of the MR headset, Vivo revealed that it has renewed its partnership with ZEISS, aiming to deepen collaboration with the German brand for better night, portrait, telephoto, and video features on Vivo phones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Like the generation before it, the Watch 4 comes in two sizes. There's the standard 41mm size that has always existed all the way back since the first Pixel Watch. Then there's the larger 45mm option that was added to the lineup with the Pixel 3. The beautifully polished pebble-like Pixel Watch 4 looks stunning in both sizes, though I am partial to the 41mm option as I have small wrists.</p><p>The best Google Pixel Watch 4 bands come in all sizes and colors. Whether you need a classy leather band for a date or a sleek metal band for a formal meeting, we've got you covered. Not many reliable third-party accessories are available for the Pixel Watch 4 yet, so you'll notice that most of the best watch bands for the Pixel Watch 4 are either from Google or Spigen. Fortunately, many first-party bands are not as expensive as expected. As for budget shoppers, Spigen takes care of that with multiple affordable options that fit the Pixel Watch 4 nicely.</p><h2 id="prioritize-getting-one-formal-and-one-casual-pixel-watch-4-band-when-shopping-2">Prioritize getting one formal and one casual Pixel Watch 4 band when shopping</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="4df653d7-e20b-4fed-9318-17705b8c42d5">            <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/watch_band_active_sport" data-model-name="Google Pixel Watch Active Sport Band" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W9aCHFLg7fTFtS3JC4EmPa.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4 with Active Sport Band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch Active Sport Band (41mm, 45mm)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best overall</strong></em></p><p>Available in six colors, the Pixel Watch Active Sport Band is breathable and comfy to wear all day because of its air holes.

All <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-bands">Pixel Watch bands</a> from the first to the fourth iterations share bands, but only for the 41mm size option.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 45mm Pixel Watch 4 can only fit older watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">bands designed for the 45mm Pixel Watch 3</a> owing to the difference in measurements.</p><h2 id="more-on-the-best-pixel-watch-4-bands-available-right-now-2">More on the best Pixel Watch 4 bands available right now</h2><p>When looking at Pixel Watch bands made for the Google Pixel Watch 4, two brands stand out: Google and Spigen. There's always been a lack of third-party band options for the Pixel Watch, and this trend seems to be continuing with the fourth Google wearable. While there are other accessory makers offering cheap options on platforms like Amazon, not many of them are from known names, and I haven't tested the cheap Chinese ones.</p><p>A good strategy when shopping for Pixel Watch 4 bands is to get one formal and one fun or casual option. That's the most versatile combo that won't bankrupt you. The formal option could be a pricey treat like one of the first-party metal bands, and the casual option could be something cheaper from Spigen. Of course, if money isn't an option, go ham. I would too, if I had the cash.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 comes with an Active Band, so I don't recommend getting more of the same. Instead, buy something like the Active Sport Band that's more durable and breathable. It can accompany you to the gym and on daily errands around town. If you want a cheaper option for rough use, I adore the Spigen Lite Fit stretchy nylon band. The only drawback with the flexible Spigen Lite Fit band is that it doesn't come in a 45mm option.</p><p>For special occasions like fancy dinners, birthday parties, or business settings, I recommend a metal band. I strongly believe every watch owner should have at least one metal strap in their arsenal. For the Pixel Watch 4, the lovely Pixel Watch Metal Slim Band is a superb option for smaller wrists. It isn't available in 45mm, so for the larger Watch 4 variant, you should get the classic Pixel Watch Metal Links Band instead. Although you only have two colors to choose from, the latter comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes. Both metal bands are made of stainless steel, which is incredibly durable, and come with extra links in the box so you can adjust the length. Google charges an arm and a leg for its metal bands, but it's a monopolistic situation, so you don't have any other choice.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Some people decided it would be a good idea to make fake photos showing their favorite candidate in a positive light or their opponent in a negative light. Or both. These pictures were shared with the intention of influencing people and, in turn, the election.</p><p>Did it succeed? I have no idea. I'm sure plenty of people believed what they were seeing (this I know because many were heavily shared), especially as AI-generated imagery becomes increasingly convincing, but whether that translated into votes is mostly unknown.</p><p>But it <em>could</em> have.</p><p>That's just an easy example. Fake photos can be used for fraud, extortion, embarrassment, or any other horrible thing people often do to each other. When you make it so easy to take a photo, share it, but edit it first to make it tell whatever story you want, it's not good. I've been fooled by a fake picture. You've been fooled, too, and there's a good chance someone close to you, like a parent, has also been fooled.</p><h2 id="content-credentials-is-a-major-step-in-the-right-direction-2">Content Credentials is a major step in the right direction</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4XisC4bCi7457jZq2jMRhQ" name="SFO-edited" alt="A photo of San Francisco that has been heavily edited." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XisC4bCi7457jZq2jMRhQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Content Credentials sounds like a good idea, but creators don't like this. If I take a photo of a sunset and have Adobe touch up the colors to make it pop, it may be identified as edited by AI. That's because it probably was. AI carries a stigma when it comes to photographs, and that attitude will need to change because we deserve to know if what we're seeing is real or fake. And yes, altering the colors of a landscape photo makes it fake.</p><p>Content Credentials<strong> </strong>will help keep fake photos from going viral, but it won't be foolproof. Nothing ever is. People dedicated to working with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-does-ai-create-an-image">AI to create or edit images</a> will see what they can do to get around being identified, and some will succeed, at least part of the time.</p><p>In the end, though, it makes it a little easier for us to trust what our eyes are seeing, and that's the important part. This may have started with the Pixel 10, but it's also said to be rolling out to other Android and iOS devices soon. It's more than a band-aid, even if it's not a foolproof solution, more of this technology will be developed because the need isn't ever going to go away.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="52e0a255-4093-484d-bb4e-127eb7f89213">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 in Indigo"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The latest AI phone</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 is Google's latest smartphone, featuring an upgraded Tensor chip that promises better photos, enhanced AI processing, and more.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Wireless charging can heat devices significantly, which can in turn harm the battery, wearing it down faster (or in rare cases even catching fire).</p><p>Some Pixel 6a models have also been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-6a-replacement-batteries-back-at-ifixit">catching fire while charging</a>, which could explain Google taking an extra cautious approach.</p><h2 id="google-limits-pixel-10-and-10-pro-wireless-charging-speeds-for-heat-and-durability-reasons-2">Google limits Pixel 10 and 10 Pro wireless charging speeds for heat and durability reasons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZEM8dtZA2KeKYHXBztaxX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Indigo-2" alt="Pixel 10 in Indig" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZEM8dtZA2KeKYHXBztaxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other factors, according to the spokesperson, include thermal performance and cooling efficiency. It's worth noting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> uses a graphene cooling system, while both Pro models use a vapor chamber.</p><p>While Google didn't explicitly say which is better, vapor chamber cooling is usually considered more effective, and the larger chamber in the Pixel 10 Pro XL may be why it can handle faster charging.</p><p>The spokesperson also noted that limiting charging speeds on the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro supports the company's promise of seven years of support. Slower charging helps reduce wear on the battery over time, making it easier to deliver on that long-term commitment.</p><p>Even though charging speeds differ, Google emphasized that the overall Qi2 experience is consistent across the lineup. This means you can use magnetic wireless chargers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> like wallets, mounts, and power banks on all models without using any third-party cases or stickers.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Google again for an official statement, but it did not get one in time for publication. We'll update this story if we hear back.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You have monthly patches that bring security fixes, and every few months, Google releases what it calls a Quarterly Platform Release, or QPR, which contains major new features for Pixel phones and other Android devices.</p><p>While the company still hasn't released the stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr1-beta-early-impressions">Android 16 QPR1 update</a>, Google is already rolling out the Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1 build for developers. If you have a compatible Pixel device running a previous Android 16 beta, you can download the OTA now by going to <strong>Settings > System > Software updates</strong>, or if you're not enrolled, you can join the beta program at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">google.com/android/beta</a>.</p><h2 id="android-16-qpr2-beta-1-brings-expanded-dark-mode-auto-themed-app-icons-2">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1 brings expanded dark mode, auto-themed app icons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZxCxfAUD6QU5EtHCKUb24Q" name="android-16-qpr2-expanded-dark-mode" alt="Expanded dark mode in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZxCxfAUD6QU5EtHCKUb24Q.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1999" height="1126" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for changes in Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/08/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here.html">says</a> the new build focuses on improvements like enhanced user experiences, new APIs for media and productivity apps, and platform features to help developers debug and test their apps.</p><p>For user-facing changes, QPR2 Beta 1 brings an "expanded option under dark theme" which forces dark theme even on apps that show light mode. The build also includes Auto-themed app icons that automatically generate a themed icon for an app if the developer doesn't provide one. The system applies a color filtering algorithm to make the icon appear in a style that fits the theme.</p><p>The first Android 16 QPR2 beta build comes with build number "<strong>BP41.250725.006</strong>" and the latest August security patch. The beta program is set to run from August 2025 until the final public release in Q4, with multiple beta builds in between.</p><p>It's worth noting that if you want to install the stable Android 16 QPR1 update on your Pixel device, you'll need to opt out of the beta program first and then update to the stable version when it releases next month.</p><p>The Android 16 QPR1 is set to bring the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> to Pixel phones, as well as Live Updates notifications and Desktop Mode.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Overall, the user claims the new photo editor is "unusable" and even "less functional" when compared to the app's previous design. One of the user's gripes was that the "display image" when editing a photo is much smaller, which doesn't make things better when the UI is already "far too cluttered."</p><p>To explain, the user states several UI elements, such as the editor's sliders, feel a little too tedious. The update makes it so users are forced to "tap in and out" of sliders in order to move between each one. If a user has changed an aspect of their photo using a slider, the post states "the button doesn't stay highlighted to let you know it was adjusted."</p><p>Quickly toggling sliders isn't occurring as it used to with the editor update; swiping through sliders takes more rotations as they've been enlarged. More importantly, the user states the core of the editor's old UI, which enabled them to do "rapid edits" on one panel with the tap of a button, no longer exists.</p><p>The user states the previous Photos editor was more "minimal," which worked better for fixing up their photography, rather than what's rolled in recently.

While it was momentous for Google, the company wanted to gift its users two updates, and one of those updates was this new editor UI. At the time, Google said its editor UI updates would offer "AI-powered suggestions" while fixing your captures. Additionally, Google said that the changes would further encourage "quick edits."</p><p>In contrast to what Google's said, end-users aren't finding these changes so favorable. Some, like the OP, would like to roll back instead of keeping what Google's brought.</p><p>Google's May update informed users that they could also tap on a specific part of their photo to receive AI suggestions on how to fix it. The second update brought a patch to sharing in Google Photos. Now, users can retrieve a QR code and let their loved ones scan it to see the album on their phones.</p><p>A more recent update from July for the Photos app dropped a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-photo-view-refresh-glanceable-details-action-menu">fresh look for photo view</a>. Users on iOS are able to view "glanceable" photo information, as well as a refined action menu. The update was listed as "coming soon" for Android.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This tool judges the biomechanical load from each run and tells you how many "impact load miles" your body can currently handle, helping to prevent injuries.</p><p>Running tolerance is surprisingly accurate and provides additional context to Training Readiness's focus on cardiovascular recovery. And it helps you judge whether specific workouts (like hilly runs or track workouts) put extra strain on your body. I wish <em>all</em> Garmin Forerunner watches had it, but Garmin is still keeping it to its most expensive models.</p><p>While running tolerance is my favorite Forerunner 970 tool, it's just one of many features the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">Venu X1</a>, Enduro 3, and Tactix/ Quatix 8 will receive in this update:</p><ul><li>Auto Lap by Course Point triggers your mile or kilometer splits at GPS-based course markers instead of by actual distance run, in case they don't align.</li><li>Add a race to your calendar, and Garmin will project your ideal final race time based on how long you have left to train.</li><li>If you run to a track, Garmin auto-detects it and locks your route to that track, then goes back to free tracking when you leave it.</li><li>Garmin Triathlon Coach gives you a variety of running, cycling and swimming workouts, personalized to your performance and fitness level.</li><li>If you have a Garmin HRM 600 chest strap, Garmin will calculate your running economy (ml/kg/km) and speed step loss (how much momentum you lose per stride).</li></ul><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-race-projection" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 showing the projected pace for a half marathon, with a blue line pointing to possible times seven weeks from now." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MLC2qP4VW6tpaX7bsmzU7b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On top of all this, Garmin is introducing daily suggested track workouts, including on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Forerunner 570</a> and 970. It's a spin-off of your daily suggested runs, except that it cuts the easier stuff and ports your tempo, threshold, VO2 Max, anaerobic, and sprint workouts so that they're all visible in the Track Run activity.</p><p>And beyond running, some recent Garmin smarts like Evening Report, the smart wake alarm, rucking activity with pack weight, and a calculator app are coming to most models. You can see the feature list — and which watches will receive them — below:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2492px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="T5wNhbh9paMsjcSMRidAV8" name="Garmin-august-2025-update" alt="The Garmin August 2025 product update chart showing which new features each smartwatch received." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T5wNhbh9paMsjcSMRidAV8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2492" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And if all that somehow isn't enough, if you go to the Garmin Forums, you can find a complete list of updates and fixes, more than what's shown above. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/outdoor-recreation/outdoor-recreation/f/fenix-8-series/419673/fenix-8-system-software-17-28">Fenix 8 17.28 update</a> includes an emoji keyboard, a way to access apps by swiping left from the watch face, new notification types, and a couple dozen other tweaks.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.garmin.com/sports-fitness/running-multisport/f/forerunner-970/419639/forerunner-970---software-version-12-70---50">Forerunner 970 12.70 update</a> includes some fun new tricks, like the ability to hear LiveTrack spectator messages over the watch's speaker during a race, a watch face data field for running tolerance mid-activity, and custom focus modes. It also fixes personal records so they are judged by elapsed time instead of logged time; that way, you can't cheat into a world-record time by pausing and restarting.</p><p>As for more affordable 2025 Garmin watches, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a> is getting the Evening Report, Rucking activities, automatic rest timers for Strength activities, and a Tips app, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> update mostly focuses on bug fixes.</p><p>Unfortunately, we don't see any major updates for older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. Owners of last-gen flagships like the Fenix 7 or Epix Pro Gen 2, in particular, will feel aggrieved that Garmin is locking them out from new features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are options in every budget, be it below $40, below $30, or even below $20. Naturally, you get what you pay for, but what you get is still surprisingly adequate at lower price points.</p><p>All things considered, the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Pixelsnap Case is the best overall case for the foldable. The soft, velvety texture feels really smooth against the skin. It works effortlessly well with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap ecosystem</a> of accessories, and there are three assorted colors to choose from. The only issue is the steep price tag, which stands at $70 right now.</p><p>Cheaper options exist aplenty. You should stick with reputable brands like Spigen when shopping with a tight wallet. This guarantees you get your money's worth. For instance, the Spigen Slim Armor Pro MagFit for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold costs about $45, but you get everything and more. The drop-proofing, impact resistance, raised edges, and reinforced spine are all characteristics of much more expensive Pixel 10 Pro Fold cases. In addition to all this, you also get certified Pixelsnap integration.</p><p>If you'd like to show off the design and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-color-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-should-you-buy">color of your Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, a translucent or transparent case might be more appropriate. In that case, try the semi-see-through Ghostek Covert case or the fully clear FNTCASE Clear Magnetic Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Case instead.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This Pixel 10 Pro XL case is a prime example. At only $12, it's easily the cheapest case around for the phone, but you still get a magnetic ring and a screen protector.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="magnetism-is-the-best-feature-of-pixel-10-pro-xl-cases-2">Magnetism is the best feature of Pixel 10 Pro XL cases</h2><p>Magnetism is crucial for a solid Pixel 10 Pro XL case. The highlight of the Pixel 10 series is the proper launch of Qi2 magnetic wireless charging. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> lineup of accessories includes chargers and stands. They showcase how useful this feature can be. If you miss out on the benefits of magnetism because of a phone case, you might as well stick with the last-gen Pixel 9 Pro XL instead.</p><p>You know what's amazing about the best Google Pixel 10 Pro XL cases? A large portion of them cost less than $30, with some prices as low as under $20! There's no need to break the bank to get an excellent protective case, even with MagSafe or Qi2 integration in tow. Even the certified Made by Google case from Mous costs $45, which is cheaper than Google's own case. Available in some stunning colors like Hot Coral, the Mous Super Thin Google Pixel 10 Pro XL Case has Qi2 support, a soft microfiber lining, and decent scratch and drop resistance. Its thinness is second to none, with the only exception being the Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case. Considering the fancy Thinborne option costs a whopping $70, that's an impressive feat.</p><p>Budgets can get quite constricted. If you're scraping the bottom of the barrel at this point, you can go for the most cheerfully cheap case of the lot. The FNTCASE Google Pixel 10 Pro XL Translucent Matte Case costs only $12, and you even get a screen protector with it. Talk about value! I have tested FNTCASE's products before, and they're quite sturdy, almost as good as brands like TORRAS and ESR, so it's not like you have to compromise on quality either. A big bonus is that you also get magnetic support baked into it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Preorder the smartphone from T-Mobile ahead of its August 28th release date, for instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10"><strong>and you could get the base model Pixel 10 for 100% free</strong></a> when you add a qualified line.</p><p>Unlike most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-10-deals">Google Pixel 10 deals</a> we've seen so far, no trade-in is required, and nearly all of T-Mobile's data plans will earn you the max amount of credit. Not too shabby for a stylish, AI-boosted smartphone that hasn't even been released yet.</p><h2 id="new-t-mobile-deal-could-get-you-a-free-google-pixel-10-no-trade-in-required-2">New T-Mobile deal could get you a FREE Google Pixel 10, no trade-in required</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="1856c3d2-092c-4183-96a1-5d42135aa0a0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe" name="Google-Pixel-10-render-Indigo-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" data-dimension112="1856c3d2-092c-4183-96a1-5d42135aa0a0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" data-dimension25=""><del>$799</del><strong> FREE with most plans at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>The Pixel 10 has finally arrived, and you can already get the upcoming flagship for free by adding a line with most of T-Mobile's data plans. No trade-in is required, the only catch is that you'll need to pay any applicable sales tax and a $35 activation fee. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1856c3d2-092c-4183-96a1-5d42135aa0a0" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>Although it's not quite the dramatic upgrade that we were hoping for, the Google Pixel 10 is still an impressive flagship phone with new hardware and a few surprising specs under the hood. All three phones in the flagship line — which includes the standard Pixel 10, the Pixel 10 Pro, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL — are powered by the new Google Tensor G5 chipset, plus you get an upgraded triple camera system, a bunch of new AI-powered software features, and seven years of OS and security upgrades guaranteed. The Pixel 10 is also the first major Android phone to sport Qi2 MagSafe support.</p><p>There were a few choices that some Android fans may not appreciate, such as removing the physical SIM card tray, but these are pretty minor issues when you look at the overall package here. The big question is if you should upgrade if you're already the proud owner of a Pixel 9. Fortunately, we built a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 10 vs Pixel 9 guide</a> to address this very problem. Needless to say, if you <em>do</em> choose to upgrade, this T-Mobile deal might be the way to go.</p><h2 id="need-a-backup-plan-2">Need a backup plan?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-render-Obsidian-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DtJyAZAFDXdrcN8oCA6ib.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10-pro" data-dimension112="52b5810c-9483-47e3-a8ed-8785ed90dd29" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$999" data-dimension48="$999" data-dimension25=""><del>$999</del> <strong>From $299 with new line, or FREE with eligible trade-in at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>If you need more power than what the standard Pixel 10 has to offer, you can preorder the Google Pixel 10 Pro through T-Mobile and score $800 off when you add a line with an eligible data plan.

What Google briefly teased was a smaller device, but it looks almost like a squished sphere with a bright Gemini ring light beneath it, which illuminates blue and purple when the AI is speaking.</p><p>The device looks like it could be an upcoming iteration of Google's Nest Mini, rather than its larger Nest Audio device. Unfortunately, Google's event didn't elaborate on what this could be, considering it was Gemini's capabilities that took center stage for that particular segment.</p><p>While it's unclear when we could see this new product, there's something else to expect.</p><h2 id="caught-you-by-surprise-2">Caught you by surprise</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXCXTQIIvM0?start=1800" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/gemini-for-home/">follow-up post</a> by the company explained those AI features we saw: Gemini for Home, a "more powerful Google Assistant" (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">poor Assistant</a>) for everyday tasks in your house. Google says this new AI's hallmarks include the ability to understand "the context" of what you're asking, while also doing away with "rigid commands."</p><p>With Gemini expected in Google Home, the post states can handle anything you ask. Google states Gemini can help users with removing unsightly pests in the yard to planning a vacation overseas. Additionally, users can "coordinate" their lives with Gemini for Home.</p><p>The post teases the AI's ability to create new calendar events, timers, and the potential for users to ask Gemini to add all the items for a specific recipe to their grocery list. Gemini's understanding and reasoning capabilities fuel its ability to act on more complex commands. For example, Google says users can tell Gemini for Home to dim the lights and set a new temperature, all in one sentence.</p><p>For music, Gemini can not only track down oldies but goldies, but it can also help you figure out the song you're looking for when you say, "play that song from this year's summer blockbuster about race cars."</p><p>Google's blog post adds that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> is making its way into the home via its smart devices. The company highlights the user's ability to initiate conversations with "Hey Google," but after that, users can freely speak with the AI for follow-up questions and more insight. Gemini Live can reportedly help users with complex topics and problems they may find difficult, like troubleshooting devices/appliances, cooking assistance, and researching nutrition plans.</p><p>Moreover, Google states Gemini Live at home can also help you brainstorm. This point reminds us of its recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-ai-storybook-new-level-of-imagination-bedtime-update">storybook update for the Gemini app</a>, as users can have the AI assist with bedtime stories and more.</p><p>Gemini for Home is expected to roll out in early access in October for Google's existing speakers and displays. This early access will include "free and paid versions." Google teases more details, but that's likely to surface closer to its early access start date.</p><h2 id="made-by-google-2025-2">Made by Google 2025</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KfcgMVRmmaxfaFyxaaFsm" name="Pixel-10-Pro-XL-all-hues" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in all colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KfcgMVRmmaxfaFyxaaFsm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this afternoon was the main event, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/all-the-biggest-announcements-at-googles-pixel-event">the Made by Google event in NYC</a> highlighted every major product launch.

You get a flat-edge design with rounded corners and a protruding camera visor housing the sensors on the back with the "G" logo in the middle. The Pixel 10 Pro XL is both heavier and bulkier than the Galaxy S25 Edge, but in return, you get features like a larger battery, faster charging speeds, and native <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/will-the-google-pixel-10-support-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 MagSafe-like charging</a> support with magnets built into the phone.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is unlike any recent Samsung flagship. From the start, it's been focused on offering a slim phone, and the numbers prove it: the S25 Edge is just 5.8mm thick and extremely light at 163 grams. The Google Pixel 10 XL is 8.6mm thick and 232 grams heavier, for comparison.</p><p>Design-wise, it differs from other Galaxy S25 models, which have separate camera sensors protruding individually, while the S25 Edge has a vertical camera module. There are no magnets on the Galaxy S25 Edge, so you'll need third-party cases for Qi2 magnetic charging functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-14" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paQZiUGAMkZ4nPzs9ugjXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a>, both phones offer high-resolution displays.

As expected, it comes with Google’s new Tensor G5 chipset. What's different this time is that Google turned to TSMC to produce the chip on its 3nm process, whereas Samsung Foundry made previous Tensor chips. The result should be improved sustained performance and better efficiency compared to earlier generations, which often struggled with overheating and lag.</p><p>Google says the Tensor G5 is "built for the Gemini era" and calls it the company's most "significant upgrade," with deeper customization from architecture to manufacturing. The Tensor G5's TPU is said to be 60% faster for on-device AI tasks, while Google claims the CPU is 34% improved over last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, uses Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, which is widely regarded as the best available in smartphones. It has consistently proven itself in performance and efficiency. We're not sure yet if the Tensor G5 has improved enough to surpass the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but it should come close. More testing of the Pixel 10 Pro XL will make that clear.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua OLED, 120Hz, 1344 x 2992, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,300 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, 1440 x 3120, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2, 2,600 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultra-wide</p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultra-wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, physical SIM tray</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, Face unlock</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>3,900mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>45W USB-C fast wired charging<br>Pixelsnap wireless charging (Qi2.2, 25W)</p></td><td  ><p>25W USB-C fast wired charging</p><p>15W wireless (no native Qi2 support)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.6mm; 232g</p></td><td  ><p>158.2 x 75.6 x 5.8 mm; 163g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, Jade</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium Icyblue, Titanium Silver, Titanium Jetblack</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of internal hardware, the Pixel 10 Pro XL ships with 16GB of RAM across all models, while the Galaxy S25 Edge comes with 12GB RAM on both the 256GB and 512GB variants.</p><p>There's one key area, though, where Google clearly takes the lead over the Galaxy S25 Edge, and that is proper support for Qi2.2 wireless charging. As rumored, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the first flagship Android smartphone in the US to ship with Qi2 magnets built in.</p><p>This means you won't need third-party cases or accessories to make it compatible with MagSafe, as it supports them out of the box. In fact, of all the Pixel 10 series phones, only the Pro XL supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2 standard</a>, enabling faster 25W wireless charging, while the rest top out at 15W.</p><p>Beyond charging, this also opens the door to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> like magnetic power banks, wallets, docks, car chargers, and more. Google has even unveiled its own lineup of magnetic accessories for the Pixel 10 series under the "PixelSnap" brand.</p><p>On the software side, both phones will support up to seven years of OS updates, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box, giving it one more major update than the S25 Edge, which runs on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>. Samsung has been testing One UI 8 based on Android 16 for the Galaxy S25 series, which should arrive soon.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JtT6RUBnjWdpzsRzAkLpwS" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-8.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL home page showing icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JtT6RUBnjWdpzsRzAkLpwS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, battery life is another key area where the Pixel 10 Pro XL should easily beat the Galaxy S25 Edge. We're looking at a 5,200mAh battery on the Pixel 10 Pro XL versus a 3,900mAh battery on the S25 Edge powering similar 6.8- vs 6.7-inch displays. The Snapdragon 8 Elite is impressively efficient, but given the massive battery difference and the fact that Tensor G5 is built on a more efficient process, endurance should be better on the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>Charging speeds also favor the Pixel. It supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">45W fast charging</a> compared to just 25W on the S25 Edge. While the smaller S25 Edge battery should still charge quickly, the 10 Pro XL delivers a better balance of large capacity and faster charging.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-cameras-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wWstzago54eeRYsUVi8uza" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-holding-in-front-of-pool" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wWstzago54eeRYsUVi8uza.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regarding cameras, this again looks like a win for the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

Thanks to Google AI, the Pixel 10 Pro XL can zoom up to 100x using Pro Res Zoom.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Edge, on the other hand, ships with a 200MP primary camera and a 12MP ultrawide sensor. And despite the fact that this is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-camera-review">same 200MP camera</a> found in the top-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, the slim flagship lacks a dedicated telephoto lens, meaning you can only zoom without quality loss up to 2x. There is digital zoom up to 10x, but that's about it.</p><p>So if you're going to a concert or want to capture videos of your kid performing on stage from afar, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is probably the phone you want.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-which-should-you-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SDFAo2E6h6WUqPueWtfpvV" name="google-pixel-10-pro-XL-jade-04" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDFAo2E6h6WUqPueWtfpvV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge are clearly made for two very different kinds of users. The Galaxy S25 Edge is designed entirely around users looking for a slim, light phone that can be used all day without fatigue and without compromising performance. The battery life may mean charging more often than the Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the lack of a telephoto sensor might be a drawback, but the phone is for those who value slimness above all else.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL, on the other hand, finally feels like a complete flagship from Google competing on all fronts. It's the first Android smartphone to ship with Qi2.2 out of the box, has a more capable and efficient Tensor G5 chipset, and offers a bigger battery plus faster charging than the S25 Edge.</p><p>It runs on the latest version of Android and brings plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-pixel-10-magic-cue-with-in-context-suggestions-ai-details">new AI features</a>, including Magic Cue, Camera Coach to guide you while taking photos, and Auto Best Take to ensure the best shots. Even though it costs $100 more than the S25 Edge at $1,199, it has its own perks and advantages.</p><p>All told, both phones target different users, but for most people, the Pixel 10 Pro XL feels like the more complete phone.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ebbbcd11-22b3-45c7-bc12-1d6565584e05">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The smarter choice</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best phone Google has to offer.

All three models support reverse wireless charging. </p></article></section><h2 id="everything-to-know-about-the-google-pixel-10-s-battery-and-charging-specs-2">Everything to know about the Google Pixel 10's battery and charging specs</h2><p>Google officially revealed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">the Pixel 10 series</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">a Made by Google event on Aug. 20</a>, confirming the devices' battery and charging specs. Every single Pixel 10 model is getting slightly faster charging speeds, with the premium Pixel 10 Pro XL receiving the biggest boost.</p><p>The base-model Pixel 10 will charge at 29W with a cable. That's up slightly from the 27W rate supported by the Google Pixel 9. The faster charging coincides with more battery capacity. The new model ships with a 4,970mAh battery, which is an increase of 270mAh compared to its predecessor.</p><p>These same charging speeds are supported by the Google Pixel 10 Pro. The larger and most expensive handset, the Pixel 10 Pro XL, offers the fastest charging speeds. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL charges at up to 39W with a cable. In comparison, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> can only hit 37W wired speeds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-puck-02" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPmu5rhFzr7dnamiB939CQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As such, all three models are gaining faster charging speeds, increased by 2W across the board. It's not a major jump, and Pixel phones will still charge slower than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. However, it is still a welcome change for Pixel 10 buyers who want even shorter charge times.</p><p>This year, wireless charging speeds aren't standard across the entire Pixel 10 lineup. The Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro have Qi2 support for 15W wireless charging speeds. However, the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2.2</a> spec, enabling support for faster 25W wireless charging speeds.</p><p>Another thing to note is that Google embedded Qi2 magnets within the Pixel 10 models themselves, rather than passing the buck onto case and accessory makers.

The Google Pixel Watch has sported a custom "waterdrop" design since its inception, and that continues with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</a> finds a new identity this year, as it features a squircle aluminum chassis with an overlaid circular display. Both smartwatches stand out on the wrist and are readily identifiable.</p><p>Although the Galaxy Watch 8's shape makes it look bigger than the Pixel Watch 4, that actually isn't the case. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is flatter, so looks can be deceiving. In reality, the smartwatch is offered in 40mm and 44mm sizes, whereas the Pixel Watch 4 is sold in larger 41mm and 45mm versions. Both smartwatches can be configured with optional LTE connectivity for an additional fee.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FVnEVHxkpjEGo97NTf43JQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-18" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 on a railing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVnEVHxkpjEGo97NTf43JQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is significantly thinner than the Pixel Watch 4, in part due to Samsung's new squircle "cushion" design, which spreads out the components on a larger surface area on your wrist. The former measures 8.6mm thick, while the latter measures 12.3mm thick. In my own testing of the Galaxy Watch 8, I found the thinner form factor to be more comfortable during workout and sleep tracking sessions.</p><p>Otherwise, the Pixel Watch 4, well, looks like a Pixel Watch. The charging contacts are still pins rather than WPC-based wireless on the Galaxy Watch 8. However, they're now found on the side of the Pixel Watch 4 instead of on the back. It's the third charging system in four generations, which isn't ideal. With that in mind, there are some cool features that come out of it, like a dock-style connector with nightstand features.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-charger-misaligned-indicator" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on a charger indicating that the alignment is off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ejrZiuxRvyc3BGPxe4bRDb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3822" height="2150" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Watch always sported a curved glass panel on the front, but the Pixel Watch 4 takes that one step further. Now, the OLED display itself is domed, making for a more immersive experience. Paired with slimmer bezels, the Pixel Watch 4 screen feels larger and has a bigger active area than its predecessor.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy Watch 8 ships with either a 1.34-inch, 438x438 screen or a 1.47-inch, 480x480 screen. Both options are Super AMOLED displays with 3,000 nits of peak brightness, perfect for outdoor viewing. Samsung uses a "digital bezel" for navigation, meaning you slide your finger along the exterior of the circular display instead of swiping.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-watch-4-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Watch 4 vs. Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mB7hcP675y9ndNrYjbceqL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-11" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mB7hcP675y9ndNrYjbceqL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, both Samsung and Google are using mostly the same collection of health and fitness sensors for 2025 as last year. The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 has the company's new BioActive sensor assortment introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a>. The Google Pixel Watch 4 has a few upgrades, like support for dual-band GPS, but the core Fitbit-based health sensors are unchanged.</p><p>While Samsung stuck with its Exynos W1000 wearable platform for another year, Google upgraded to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 Gen 2</a>. This likely isn't as much of an upgrade as you might expect, but the more curious change is the upgrade to a new co-processor. It's the Cortex M55, and it's designed to handle specific tasks while prioritizing efficiency.</p><p>This tweak is just one way Google might have improved battery life on the Pixel Watch 4 without significantly increasing hardware capacity.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Watch 4</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display </p></td><td  ><p>41mm or 45mm</p><p>Actua 360 AMOLED LTPO display</p><p>3,000 nits, 1-60Hz</p></td><td  ><p>40mm (1.34-inch, 438x438) or 44mm (1.47-inch, 480x480)</p><p>Super AMOLED display</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 Gen 2, Cortex M55 co-processor</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Exynos W1000</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection </p></td><td  ><p>Corning Gorilla Glass 5, 5ATM, IP68</p></td><td  ><p>Sapphire Crystal glass, 5ATM, IP68, MIL-STD-810H</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Recycled aluminum case</p></td><td  ><p>Armor Aluminum case</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity </p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 6, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, UWB, LTE (optional), dual-frequency GPS, Galileo, Glonass, (ROW) Beidou, QZSS, Navic, Satellite SOS, </p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.3, Wi-Fi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, LTE (optional), GPS, Galileo, Glonass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Compass, altimeter, barometer, magnetometer, 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light, multi-path optical heart rate sensor, cEDA, SpO2, ECG, far field skin temperature sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Bio-signal Sensor + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 325mAh, 30 hours with AOD, 48 hours with Battery Saver</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 455mAh, 40 hours with AOD, 72 hours with Battery Saver</p></td><td  ><p>325mAh/435mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p><strong>41mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 25 minutes to 80%, 45 minutes to 100%</p><p><strong>45mm</strong>: 15 minutes to 50%, 30 minutes to 80%, 60 minutes to 100%</p></td><td  ><p>Fast charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM / storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB/ 32GB </p></td><td  ><p>2GB/ 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS </p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 6</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Matte Black, Polished Silver, Champagne Gold (41mm), Satin Moonstone (45mm)</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Battery life is improved across the board, with the 41mm Pixel Watch 4 now lasting 30 hours with AOD on and the 45mm variant extending that figure to 40 hours.

It starts with design, since you won't want to wear something daily on your wrist if you don't find it attractive. I still think the Galaxy Watch 8 clears in this category, though the Pixel Watch 4's domed OLED display certainly helps. I'd recommend the Pixel Watch if you want a minimalist device that barely looks like a smartwatch, and the Galaxy Watch if you want to lean into the "smart" look.</p><p>In terms of software, both devices are running <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, so there isn't much separation there. With that being said, there are some exclusives and integrations you'll only get with a matching phone. If there's a particular health feature you're looking for — like Fitbit Morning Brief or Samsung's Running Coach — be sure to buy the right watch.</p><p>At the end of the day, you should probably just buy the one that matches your Android phone best, but you can't go wrong with either choice.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="eb0be99e-23ca-4963-92f5-460c3b77e41b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YWKDPKpC7M992KeWUNcbF.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch 4"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for Pixels</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel Watch 4 is the best Wear OS smartwatch for people who already own a Google Pixel phone.

This achingly lovely device has so much to offer. The only debilitating decision to make regarding the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is deciding which color you should buy. Normally, I'd say look at the storage options tied to each colorway first, but that's not something to worry about with the new Pixel Fold. Both colorways of the device come with 256GB, 512GB with Zoned UFS, or 1TB with Zoned UFS.

If you want to stick with a more professional, business-friendly look, then the mature Moonstone colorway is more suitable for you. This grayish blue silver isn't as brash or loud as the Jade colorway. It looks high-end through and through, but without overimposing.</p><p>On the other hand, if you want a shade that's more out there, the Jade colorway of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the picture of perfection. Its luxurious gold accents, like the frame and camera bar, look divine. The light green body looks light and fresh while maintaining that expensive appearance.</p><p>Don't forget to take into account whether you already own or are planning to purchase more Google Pixel devices to go with your Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in matching shades like Moonstone. If you want a more unified, on-brand shade, getting everything in Moonstone isn't a bad idea.</p><p>Most importantly, have fun with your choice! This is an expensive phone and if you're treating yourself, make a purchase that makes you smile every time you look at it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google does one (rather, eight) better than that for customers in the U.S. as well. You're able to store multiple numbers on the same device and even use more than one at the same time.

One question many have, however, is whether the Google Pixel 10 is eSIM only, meaning you can’t use a physical SIM card.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10, and all the new Google Pixel devices, for that matter, have not just one eSIM but dual eSIMs in the U.S. This means you can have two eSIMs active on the phone at the same time. This could be a personal and a work number, for example, or a local one and one local to your secondary office in another city or even country.</p><p>Further, those in the U.S. can store eight or more eSIMs and swap among them. You can make good use of the option if you travel a lot for work, for example, and you want to have a local number wherever you go. You don’t have to worry about getting a temporary local SIM card to swap into the device. You could also use this feature to load different travel eSIMs.</p><h2 id="the-dual-sim-design-in-other-countries-2">The dual SIM design in other countries</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2786px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LBJP3AvktupD6FrfBsyEkh" name="Google-Pixel-10-Indigo-official-lifestyle-2" alt="A man holding the Google Pixel 10 up to the side of his face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LBJP3AvktupD6FrfBsyEkh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2786" height="1567" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For users in other countries, including Canada, you get dual SIMs as well, but one is a physical nano SIM and the other is an eSIM. So, you get the best of both worlds: an eSIM embedded into the hardware that is activated digitally and a physical card if you want to transfer one from an older phone, for example.</p><p>Google says that the decision to go eSIM-only in the U.S. helps the company achieve its "cleanest Pixel designs yet with no SIM tray, no visible mmWave antenna cutout and the new elegant speaker mesh found on the bottom of our two pro models." Since mmWave is a frequency range predominantly utilized by U.S. carriers, it may explain the limited move to eSIM-only.</p><p>However, in other countries, you can still swap between two numbers, including one via eSIM and one via nanoSIM. Presumably, however, only one can be active at a time.</p><h2 id="can-you-convert-a-physical-sim-to-an-esim-2">Can you convert a physical SIM to an eSIM?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uEjApC4HcRpgFbwStT52jX" name="Google-Pixel-10-Indigo-Material-3-Expressive-2" alt="Pixel 10 in Indigo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uEjApC4HcRpgFbwStT52jX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re getting the Google Pixel 10 in the U.S., you'll need to convert the existing SIM card in your current phone to a digital one. This will work for any carrier that supports eSIM activations.</p><p>You may, however, have to reach out to your carrier first to facilitate the conversion process. They can help you achieve this through various methods, which can include a QR code, a digital activation code, or a setup process through an app.</p><p>Once you’re done installing, you’ll need to deactivate the physical SIM and remove it from the old device. You can then switch over to the new phone using the eSIM, and it will work smoothly as butter.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's latest phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="be1282ae-2f8e-4467-a390-24aa6688dcb9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Work, play, and more</strong></em></p><p>Thanks to the dual eSIM design of the U.S. version of the Google Pixel 10, you can add two eSIMs and connect to both at the same time.

The wearable utilizes the innovative <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6"><u>Wear OS 6</u></a> Material 3 Expressive UI while delivering snappy performance from the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 chip. You also get a considerable boost in battery life, upgraded dual-frequency GPS, and instant access to all the new AI-boosted Fitbit features when those go live in October. Should Pixel Watch 3 owners plan to upgrade when the new watch hits store shelves? It depends, but I certainly wouldn't consider it without a good deal attached.</p> ]]></dc:content>
