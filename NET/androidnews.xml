The chief executive officer at Oura, Tom Hale, states, "ŌURA has sold over 2.5 million rings since June 2024, reaching in just over a year what previously took the company eleven years to achieve since its founding in 2013."</p><p>Hale adds that the achievement is a "testament" to the "incredible demand" for its smart rings.</p><p>The post highlights that the Oura Ring is available in over 150 countries. Moreover, it reiterates the company's presence on Amazon, which consumers found welcoming, as Business Wire states, Oura became the fastest-growing brand on the platform.</p><p>Aside from this, Oura states that its sales performance has doubled, which seemingly goes hand-in-hand with its newest units sold. The post states that Oura has passed over $500 million of earned revenue in 2024, and is reportedly on track to surpass $1 billion by the end of 2025.</p><h2 id="oura-made-some-moves-and-continued-its-health-focus-2">Oura made some moves, and continued its health focus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-04" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus revealing scratches on the back with the Oura Ring 4 top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZPvFWFdsHSySsgtQVVvsX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The press release's mention of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-retail-amazon-samsung-competition">Oura's smart rings on Amazon</a> takes us back to 2024 when the announcement first occurred. A range of its devices was posted on Amazon's marketplace as Oura sought to get ahead of its expected competition: Samsung. Oura saw this shift as a way to expand its retail presence and reach even more consumers.</p><p>While this came at a time when the world was expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-expanding-the-galaxy-ring-in-five-important-new-ways">Samsung Galaxy Ring</a>, Oura's chief marketing officer, Doug Sweeny, said new competition was a "positive thing." Sweeny added that Samsung's (then-pending) introduction into smart rings gave Oura "validation" in what they were doing. We've since seen how that "validation" has become a real positive for Oura over this past year.</p><p>Recently, the smart ring company has continued to focus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-ring-pregnancy-insights-perimenopause-features">on moms and premenopausal women</a>. The latter arrived as a new "Perimenopause Check-In" for women to track their symptoms and receive personalized health reports. For mothers, Oura added Pregnancy Insights to its app, and it now offers guidance for expectant mothers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Rather than focusing solely on packing laptop-level performance into a bulky folding smartphone, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is all about style. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4859px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bcanSSX2Fbnp8dxazFnqYV" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bcanSSX2Fbnp8dxazFnqYV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4859" height="2733" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Measuring just 8.9mm of thickness when folded, this book-style smartphone is ridiculously sleek and lightweight, with a nearly-invisible center crease and two stunning 120Hz AMOLED displays.

Our testing showed that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 typically lasts around 20 hours with normal use.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 also ditches S Pen support in favor of the thin profile, and you're only getting IP48 water and dust resistance. These are minor issues that may feel a bit nitpicky, but there are many folks who understandably might want more from a $2,000 phone.</p><p>To be honest, when I heard that Samsung was increasing the starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to $1,999.99, I had my doubts that anyone would be interested in paying such a premium. Clearly I was wrong, but if you (like me) were waiting for the right Galaxy Z Fold 7 deal to come along, now's your chance to grab the top-rated foldable at a much more reasonable price. </p> ]]></dc:content>

If you want a keyboard case, nothing works better than the Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover Keyboard Slim. However, it's also eye-wateringly expensive, priced at an ungodly $145. And if you skip the keyboard to cut costs, the basic Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Book Cover isn't any better. Without a keyboard, you'd still pay a whopping $90 for a mere tablet cover with a folio and stand.</p><p>Of course, Samsung's own cases work like a dream, hugging the Tab S11 in all the right places. However, at those prices, you're better off getting dupes that function almost as well as the first-party ones. Alternatively, you can turn to reliable name brands such as Spigen to get quality you can depend on. The Spigen Rugged Armor Pro for Galaxy Tab S11 is rugged, affordable, and practical. With raised edges and several layers of material added to it for better drop-proofing, it is somewhat bulky, but you get ease of mind in exchange. The Spigen case also has a kickstand and an S Pen storage compartment.</p><p>If it's dupes you're interested in, the Doohoeek Bluetooth Keyboard Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a cost effective keyboard case for the Tab S11. It has a backlit keyboard, scissor-switch keys, a low profile, a kickstand, and even an S Pen slot. If you want to go even cheaper, the HUKWIMO Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 is a budget-friendly buy without a keyboard. It imitates the three-fold design of the first-party Tab S11 Book Cover, so you can fold the cover to convert it into a stand in three different ways.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This potential feature is presumably designed to limit how much of your screen can be seen from side angles.</p><p>The idea is simple but smart: if you’re on a bus or standing in a crowded line, the person next to you shouldn’t get an eyeful of your banking details or private chats.</p><p>According to the leaked code strings, Private Display isn’t just a manual toggle. Samsung is baking in some intelligence here. The feature can reportedly kick in automatically when you’re using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place.</p><p>There also seem to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control. Users might even be able to pick specific apps to trigger the feature or schedule when it turns on.</p><h2 id="new-hardware-needed-2">New hardware needed</h2><p>What makes this particularly exciting is that it likely ties into new hardware. Samsung’s display division has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank">been developing “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a>, an AI-driven pixel adjustment that changes viewing angles. However, this tech is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1957681630509953114" target="_blank">rumored</a> to be compatible only with the Galaxy S26 Ultra and probably future Ultra models.</p><p>That means Private Display won’t be coming to every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a>. Without the right panel tech, older models probably won’t be able to pull this off.</p><p>Timing-wise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> has already started rolling out to some devices, but One UI 8.5 is expected to make its official debut alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> series in early 2026. Samsung could still tweak or delay some parts of Private Display before launch, but what’s already been uncovered shows a lot of promise.</p><p>Instead of forcing users to rely on clunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-screen-protectors">third-party screen protectors</a>, Samsung looks ready to build smarter, more seamless privacy directly into its hardware and software. For anyone who hates shoulder surfers, this should be a meaningful upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">rolling out its Teen Accounts protections in the U.S. earlier this year</a>, the company is now expanding its test to Canada.</p><p>The new settings are designed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-stricter-messaging-settings-instgram-facebook">limit interactions with unwanted accounts</a> and filter inappropriate content. So, even if someone lists an adult birthday but seems under 18, Instagram’s AI will automatically switch them into Teen Account settings.</p><p>Those settings restrict who can contact them and filter out inappropriate content. The company is quick to acknowledge that its AI isn't perfect. If the system makes a mistake and flags an actual adult, that user will have the option to easily revert their settings and correct their age, but the goal is to keep most under-18s in a safer digital space by default.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.69%;"><img id="bGum5FJod4Nab3LgWdPe4J" name="Instagram-teen-accounts-settings" alt="Teen Accounts settings on Instagram" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bGum5FJod4Nab3LgWdPe4J.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1067" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="parents-are-getting-a-nudge-too-2">Parents are getting a nudge, too</h2><p>The move isn’t just about algorithms. Parents are getting pulled in, too. Starting today, Instagram will send notifications to parents in Canada with conversation tips, developed with pediatric psychologist Dr. Ann-Louise Lockhart, on how to talk with their teens about using their real birthdays online.</p><p>Instagram's message is clear: if teens list the right ages, the system can protect them better.</p><p>The company says more than 54 million teens worldwide are already in Teen Accounts, and 97% of 13 to 15-year-olds have kept the protections on. Over 90% of surveyed parents think the safeguards help, but many still feel overwhelmed by managing their kids’ online lives. By nudging parents directly and backing them up with AI, Instagram is hoping to close the gap.</p><p>The platform admits age verification online is still an industry-wide headache. Even with AI and parental involvement, misrepresentation happens. Still, by linking parental approval and app store age checks with its own tech, Instagram is trying to make it harder for underage users to slip through the cracks.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We got to go hands-on with all of them, and I've used several pairs since 2021.</p><p>Despite coming out with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, Meta isn't sunsetting the Gen 1s at all. In fact, the company is keeping them around as the most affordable entry in the lineup, with the price scaling up from there. In total, Meta has half a dozen different smart glasses to choose from.</p><p>So which pair of Meta smart glasses is right for you? They all have Meta AI at their core and can take pictures, record video, and mirror earbud functionality when paired with any phone, but is the least expensive pair your best bet? Or should you get something a little more premium? I answer all those questions and more below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-1"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC" name="Ray-Ban-Stories-2023-recording-LED-02.jpg" alt="The status LED on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZvVXQ3wkTPHurSmVMcu9hC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite what the name says, Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) is actually the second-generation Ray-Ban smart glasses product. The original was called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> and debuted in September 2021, but the rebrand to Ray-Ban Meta for the second product was for a big reason. Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was a superb upgrade, offering Meta AI capabilities, significantly better video and picture quality, surround sound audio recording and playback, and better battery life.</p><p>Despite Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) being the cheapest of the bunch, they're still a wonderful pair of smart glasses that I think most people will be happy with. They come in three classic Ray-Ban styles — Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler — each with a wide selection of lens colors and tints. And yes, you can even get prescription lenses from -6.00 to +4.00.</p><p>But Meta doesn't seem to be stocking all available lens colors for the Gen 1s anymore. As of this writing, Meta only offers Wayfarer and Skyler on its website, and Best Buy has a very limited selection, as well.</p><div ><table><caption>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1)</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>3 Frames, 3 colors per style.

While you can ask Meta what it sees or hears, it can only process a single audio cue at a time. This means you'll need to ask questions one at a time, while newer Meta glasses support Meta AI live conversation mode.</p><p>The Gen 1's camera quality is also almost as good as the Gen 2's, despite the gulf in resolution offered in recording quality. Pictures are largely identical between generations, but video quality is significantly better on Gen 2s. Gen 1 also has worse video stabilization.</p><p>Battery life is the weakest part of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1). At just 4 hours of maximum battery life per charge, you'll be used to charging these glasses at least once per day. Thankfully, the included charging case makes it easy to top them up on the go, and you'll be able to charge the glasses fully several times over before needing to recharge the case.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d59d18c0-33e3-457a-955e-c4cd86282e55">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:56.25%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TtHvnQ6maDDrxzE4uEUDng.jpg' alt="Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses official product renders"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Style on a budget</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) packs in excellent speakers and mics, classic Ray-Ban styles, respectably high-res photos, compatibility with Facebook and Instagram for quick sharing, and other perks that make them among the best smart glasses available.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ray-ban-meta-gen-2"><span>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-4" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zc3MgCRu9SatJ3cR5kjvs8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is the most stylish pair of smart glasses Meta offers today.

Up until now, Meta's glasses were iterations of one another, but Vanguard is where the experience forks a bit. These glasses are made for athletes who plan to record their activities with a more convenient hands-free camera instead of strapping a GoPro to a helmet.</p><p>As such, they have a limited number of style options, don't support prescription lenses, and only come with Oakley PRIZM lenses. You can easily swap out lens colors if you want to buy additional ones, but there's no support for Transitions, polarized, solid color, or clear lenses at this time.</p><p>But what they lack in style, they more than make up for in capability. Oakley Meta Vanguard are the first Meta smart glasses that tie directly into Garmin and Strava, automatically matching up recorded videos with fitness data from these services. You'll even find an overlay with this data on recorded videos, which is pretty darn slick!</p><div ><table><caption>Oakley Meta Vanguard</caption><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Style options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>White or black frames, 4 lens colors, one size.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lens options</p></td><td  ><p>⭐</p></td><td  ><p>PRIZM (non-polarized)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 9 hours per charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera quality</p></td><td  ><p>⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</p></td><td  ><p>12MP ultrawide, 1080p/60FPS or 3K/30FPS video.

That's great for people who love to trick off slopes or skateboards.</p><p>Plus, the open-ear speakers are repositioned and are 6dB louder than any other Meta smart glasses. Meta says they're good for listening to in up to 30MPH winds, so you can jam to tunes while you fly down the slopes. They're also the <strong>only</strong> Meta smart glasses with an IP67 water and dust resistance rating, making them perfect for some watersports.</p><p>Oakley Meta Vanguard has the longest battery life of any Meta smart glasses, but you can't use that extra battery to livestream your tricks to the world.

The specialized electronics inside understand how human arm and hand muscles work and are used to control the glasses without a controller, touch, or even a camera to see them.</p><p>With this, you can respond to messages by writing on a table (as if you were holding a pen), turn the music volume up and down by rotating an invisible dial, and even flick through Instagram discretely using your thumb.

They're the ultimate smart glasses for people who have the budget. The $799 price tag is exorbitant compared to the rest of this list, but the capabilities here make the price more than reasonable.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7694463d-41c6-4d41-9441-bb56b3e4f191">            <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/meta-glasses-with-display" data-model-name="Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iHDiDozZ6tS92CLznmMiHn.jpg' alt="An official product render of Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses and the neural gesture band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Truly smart glasses</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Check out Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/promo/meta-glasses-with-display"><strong>at your local Best Buy</strong></a>!

This simple gadget tracked steps and sleep, and even had a vibration motor inside to alert you to phone notifications. Since then, Amazfit has morphed into a fitness powerhouse, offering dozens of different smartwatches at every price level and functionality you could dream of.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/amazfit-balance-2-impressions">Amazfit Balance 2</a> is my favorite smartwatch from the company in a long time, and its impressive capabilities are only matched by its sleek appearance. Of course, my trusty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Garmin Instinct 2X Solar</a> is still cranking right along, good as the day it came out, and is, quite frankly, hard to beat for most fitness-related tasks.</p><p>I wore both of these watches on my latest Spartan Race and had a difficult time finding any reasonable differences in the data they provided at the end of the race. Which leads me to wonder: why would I pay more for a Garmin than an Amazfit watch? I found a few reasons, and they might help you decide.</p><h2 id="price-2">Price</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg" name="amazfit-balance-2-and-t-rex-3-pro" alt="Holding an Amazfit Balance 2 and Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxvAPCFcBu3sAoLjn6BsXg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Price is the area where Amazfit wins most handily. Garmin is known for producing high-quality watches that aren't inexpensive, which has given the brand a premium image over the years. Amazfit started from the other end of things, offering dirt-cheap products and upping their game over time (but still undercutting rivals on price).</p><p>Take the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-band-7-vs-garmin-vivosmart-5">Amazfit Band 7 vs the Garmin Vivosmart 5</a>, for instance. Both of these are the latest fitness bands with displays from each respective company; yet, Garmin's is still three times the price of Amazfit's. Plus, because of software updates and a fresh Zepp app, some of the shortcomings we found in our original Amazfit Band 7 review have been rectified.</p><p>This same argument can be made for many of Amazfit's products. In many cases, competing Amazfit products offer 90-95% of the features of Garmin's at something like half the price, and that's a ratio I'm willing to work with.</p><h2 id="fitness-tracking-2">Fitness tracking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5" name="amazfit-balance-2-garmin-instinct-2x-solar-spartan-race" alt="Wearing an Amazfit Balance 2 and a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar smartwatch at a Spartan Race" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oD6JyZw7zRkHyEqGoN4Yh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, Amazfit watches felt like an obvious second-rate choice for fitness tracking. While they have offered more options for workout types — 180 on the Amazfit T-Rex 3 Pro I just got versus around 90 on the Garmin Instinct 2X I have — I wasn't convinced of the accuracy of the heart rate monitoring until this year's products.</p><p>Both the Amazfit Balance 2 and T-Rex 3 Pro have superb heart rate accuracy, matching all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness smartwatches</a> I've tested to date. I've taken these watches out for paddleboarding sessions, run a Spartan Race with them, and spent plenty of time in my CrossFit-style gym trying out everything from cardio days to strength training.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD" name="Garmin-marathon-training-widget" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on the author's wrist, showing the Primary Race widget with the Garmin Tucson Marathon time, date, weeks until the event, and goal time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JM7GTeGptrPd53ZZYtSFkD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only area I found where Garmin more consistently has the edge over Amazfit is during strength training and weight-lifting exercises. While several Amazfit workout types will give you a breakdown of what muscles you used and keep track of your reps, Garmin more consistently shows the correct workout type automatically.</p><p>For instance, my most common workout type is HIIT since it most closely aligns with my gym's typical activity types. If I look at the data from my Garmin Instinct 2X Solar, it's got muscle heatmaps of what it thinks I used, which is helpful for going back and remembering why my shoulders are suddenly sore two days later.</p><p>Amazfit only offers this kind of muscular heatmap for strength training or weightlifting exercise types. I've also found that Amazfit's watches have a harder time differentiating nuanced workouts than Garmin. If I select strength training and do a bunch of front squats with a barbell, Garmin almost always marks it as "barbell squat," while Amazfit's watches might figure that out 30% of the time.</p><h2 id="companion-apps-and-syncing-2">Companion apps and syncing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao" name="garmin-connect-spartan-race-map" alt="A map of a Spartan Race workout in the Garmin Connect app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xSLJJ6439PYTnz72ZdD9Ao.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's where things get a little mixed. As an app, Amazfit Zepp is superior. It's got a better, less convoluted UI when compared to the Garmin Connect app, and it offers a ton of additional features that Garmin just doesn't have. LLM-powered food logging is probably the greatest single feature I've used in <em>any</em> holistic workout app, and it's something only Zepp has.</p><p>But as good as the Zepp app's features and UI are, it's held back by a number of bugs that are just plain frustrating. Reddit users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazfit/comments/1khsh4r/amazfit_trex_3_and_active_2_serious_bugs_still/">have complained</a> about this many times, and it often takes Amazfit a long time to address these problems. Coding and workout algorithms are hard, no doubt, but it seems like Amazfit's team isn't able to crank out fixes as fast as some other companies.</p><p>I don't often run into problems with the app, but my original intent for this week's column was to compare data from the Spartan Race I just ran. The problem is, the Amazfit watch had my entire workout on it, but the Zepp app simply wouldn't sync the entire thing.</p><p>This left me with missing workout data when I exported the workout to quantified-self.io, the service we typically use to directly compare smartwatch fitness data. Unfortunately for my original idea, the entire stack of GPS data was missing, and the Zepp app confirmed that.</p><h2 id="holding-amazfit-back-2">Holding Amazfit back</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7" name="amazfit-balance-2-amazfit-zepp-app-workouts-02" alt="Looking at workout stats on the Zepp app next to the Amazfit Balance 2 smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nfr2GgBPduxdyWwucN5qF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem is that there's no way to manually sync fitness data from Amazfit watches or even export from the watch itself. The Zepp app normally automatically syncs all data from your watch at the end of a workout. When this fails, there seems to be no real way to resync.</p><p>Amazfit's support will tell you to force stop the app, reinstall it, clear the cache, etc. But none of these options forces a total resync, even though I can still view all the data on my watch.</p><p>It's these little annoyances (that are sometimes big problems) that Amazfit needs to fix and, ultimately, what holds it back from beating Garmin once and for all.</p> ]]></dc:content>

When Samsung announced the Galaxy Tab S11, it confirmed the flagship supports 5G, but only sub-6 networks, and there is no support for mmWave 5G networks. You'll of course need a carrier connection and plan to use it. It's also worth noting that while Samsung says the Tab S11 supports 5G, there's currently no 5G variant available for purchase in the U.S., though it is offered in other global markets.</p></article></section><h2 id="everything-you-need-to-know-about-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s-5g-connectivity-2">Everything you need to know about Samsung Galaxy Tab S11's 5G connectivity</h2><p>Like clockwork, Samsung has unveiled its next generation of flagship Android tablets. At this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-central-best-of-ifa-2025">IFA 2025</a>, the company introduced the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra. This time, Samsung has dropped the Plus model in favor of the standard 11-inch Tab S11. The new Galaxy Tab S11 lineup brings thinner builds, upgraded internals, and One UI 8 (based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>) out of the box.</p><p>Similar to last year's Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and Tab S10 Ultra, Samsung has kept 5G connectivity in the Tab S11 series. Both Galaxy Tab S11 and Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra are available in Wi-Fi-only and Wi-Fi + 5G variants globally. This means you can use Wi-Fi for streaming, downloading apps, and gaming, or get the 5G variant to stay connected on the go without relying on a Wi-Fi network.</p><p>Of course, to enjoy 5G on the go, you'll need a separate line or connection for the tablet. Samsung notes that both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support physical SIM cards — unlike some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-esim">Pixel 10 that have gone eSIM-only</a> in the U.S. Optionally, you can also configure an eSIM alongside a physical SIM.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fbEmVPxfExmLGf2cVYUuW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for 5G support, the Galaxy Tab S11 does support 5G out of the box, giving you fast speeds for streaming and downloads.

However, speeds are lower than mmWave 5G. It's worth noting that last year's Galaxy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">Tab S10+ offered mmWave 5G</a> support, but this year, Samsung has kept it consistent across the board, with both Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra only offering Sub-6 5G.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another thing to note here is that while Samsung says the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra support 5G globally, as of writing, 5G models do not appear to be available for direct purchase on Samsung's USA website.

In terms of dimensions, the S25 FE is a tad narrower and shorter, although both phones share 6.7-inch displays.

Tempered glass with 9H hardness is the industry standard. Meanwhile, plastic can be TPU, PET, or even hybrid in nature. None of them is right or wrong; it just depends on your usage.</p><p>For most people, the best Samsung Galaxy S25 FE screen protector is one made of tempered glass. The amFilm Auto-Alignment OneTouch for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE Screen Protector 2 Pack is the best overall pick for anyone. This kit includes two pieces of hardy 9H tempered glass screen protectors and camera lens protectors. The lens protectors are made of the same durable glass, but they are dark, which might put some folks off. This set also includes a highly convenient alignment frame that reduces the installation time to barely a minute or two.</p><p>If you want a screen protector set that comes with a clear camera lens protector, the firtstnow 3 Pack Glass Screen Protector for Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is better suited for you. While it's not as highly reputed as amFilm, it does have outstanding reviews online. You get three 9H tempered glass screen and lens protectors each. However, there's no installation frame in the box.</p><p>After you're done shopping for shatter-proof and scratch-resistant screen protectors, be sure to grab a shock-, impact-, and drop-resistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cases">phone case for your Galaxy S25 FE</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A decent magnetic grip can easily prevent falls and relieve your fingers of repeated stress from holding your phone too long and too frequently. The best part of a magnetic grip is that there's no sticky adhesive — you can pop the grip on and off at any given time.</p><p>The Google Pixelsnap Ring Stand is the best official Pixelsnap-certified accessory for the Pixel 10. It's affordable, functional, and lightweight. You don't need much from a ring holder for your phone to begin with. It's meant to act as a grip and a stand, and the Pixelsnap Ring Stand does both well. If you prefer a more traditional circular phone grip, the PopSockets MagSafe PopGrip in Enamel is a great alternative.</p><p>After you've chosen a decent magnetic phone grip, the next Qi2 accessory to look for is a wireless charger. The Anker MagGo 15W Qi2 Wireless Charger (2-in-1 Stand) also doubles as a phone holder that has a magnetic mount with highly adjustable tilting. You can wirelessly charge your Pixel 10 and prop it up at a comfortable viewing angle at the same time. It's priced very reasonably, too.</p><h2 id="convert-your-pixel-10-into-a-mobile-photography-or-videography-rig-2">Convert your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6778px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-qi2-kraftgeek-justtap-powershutter-mous-qi2-wireless-charging-stand-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro with several magnetic accessories." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TXvjR54mk87b7CE3foScbD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6778" height="3813" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3" name="google-pixel-10-pro-kraftgeek-powershutter-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro using the KraftGeek PowerShutter magnetic accessory." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iork6TeHJLnK2Jyr36Kza3.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3680" height="2070" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah" name="Mous-Charging-Stand-with-Qi2-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro on a magnetic Mous Charging Stand with Qi2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bKY5RYH7Tp4LfqDdvERhah.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3643" height="2049" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Converting your Pixel 10 into a mobile photography or videography rig might sound expensive and intimidating, but Qi2 greatly simplifies things. I have used countless gimbals, tripods, and phone stands over the years, and I hate fumbling with the adjustable arms the most. Clamping your phone into a traditional stand or tripod is super annoying, especially when your phone case is on the thicker side. Luckily, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/my-quest-for-the-perfect-pixelsnap-accessory-has-ended">KraftGeek JustTap Magnetic Phone Tripod</a> has a magnetic mount.</p><p>The JustTap Tripod is an ingenious way to make the most of your Google Pixel 10's magnetic prowess. All you have to do is slap your phone onto the magnetic mount and set the tripod up — which, by the way, also takes a few short seconds thanks to the "tap to unfold" base mechanism. This tripod is also unbelievably compact and lightweight, with a level of stability and sturdiness that you would not expect from something this light. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> was very happy atop the magnetic mount, even when I moved the tripod around, adjusted its height, and tested it for sturdiness with jerky movements.</p><p>I highly recommend getting a magnetic light for your Google Pixel 10's cameras. The Ulanzi LM19 Selfie Ring Light has several levels of brightness and temperature adjustability. It's highly compact and charges via USB-C, and you can tilt it thanks to the way it is built. It's a fantastic tool to boost your Pixel 10's photography game.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In the past, it was easy to criticize Apple for seemingly holding back basic features, like always-on displays and high refresh rates, from the cheapest new iPhone. The iPhone 17 flips the script, adding both of those long-awaited features and a whole lot more to make the base model eye-catching.</p><p>For those looking for a small and cheap flagship, the Samsung Galaxy S25 has looked great on paper for the past few years. It's the most compact out of the top options from Apple, Samsung, and Google, and it added a third rear camera before it was cool. Now, it's time to see whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a> can beat the Galaxy S25 at its own game in base-model value.</p><h2 id="iphone-17-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-design-and-display-2">iPhone 17 vs. Samsung Galaxy S25: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z" name="iPhone-17-Promo" alt="The entire iPhone 17 lineup against a green background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RBqitMnyURP36mpjHDf9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The iPhone 17 and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> are both small flagships, but Apple's smartphone is heavier and less compact than Samsung's. It comes down to the displays — Samsung is still using a 6.2-inch AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25, whereas Apple moved to a larger 6.3-inch screen. Both are now capable of hitting 120Hz refresh rates, and have AOD options.</p><p>Apple is using Ceramic Shield 2 glass on the iPhone 17, and Samsung opted for Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the Galaxy S25. Both are made by Corning, but the key difference is that the iPhone 17's cover glass is optimized for scratch protection and has anti-reflective properties. To get an anti-reflective screen on a Samsung Galaxy phone, you have to go with the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-6" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rtZzxZhZ9PuvR2NWJrUq8N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's hard to understate the difference in size between the iPhone 17 and Galaxy S25. By just comparing the screen sizes, the gap looks minuscule, but there's more to the story. The iPhone measures 149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm and weighs 177 grams, which is larger by every measure compared to the Galaxy S25's dimensions of 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm. The Samsung base model's weight is particularly impressive at just 162 grams — even lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/exclusive-apples-big-bet-and-its-not-the-iphone-air">iPhone Air</a>.</p><p>Surprisingly, the Galaxy S25 packs flagship specs and a larger battery capacity than the iPhone 17 in that small form factor. The only key compromise here is the display, which is smaller by one tenth of an inch. Only you can decide whether the bigger, thicker, and heavier design of the iPhone 17 is a dealbreaker, but I prefer the compact and lightweight build of the Galaxy S25.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg" name="iphone-17-colors" alt="iPhone 17 color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bTxp5zAdUrnu6DCKh6GVRg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for durability, both phones sport an IP68 certification against dust and water ingress.

It's powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> mobile platform, the same one that powers Samsung's most expensive handsets. Meanwhile, the iPhone 17 runs on an Apple A19 chip that's a lower-tier offering compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apples-a19-pro-throws-down-the-gauntlet-for-qualcomm-and-mediatek">A19 Pro</a> in the Air and Pro models. This could help the Galaxy S25 excel in AI tasks and gaming, but that remains to be seen.</p><p>Samsung has the advantage in on-device memory, with 12GB of RAM on the Galaxy S25 compared to the iPhone 17's 8GB. However, the iPhone 17 crucially starts with 256GB of base storage at the same price as the 128GB Galaxy S25. There's more storage available on the higher-end configurations, too. You can buy an iPhone 17 with up to 512GB of storage, while the Galaxy S25 tops out at 256GB.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Apple iPhone 17</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>iOS 26</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 7 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch, Super Retina XDR OLED, 120Hz, 1206 x 2622, Ceramic Shield 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.2-inch, Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X, 120Hz, Corning Gorilla Glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Apple A19</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>48MP main + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP, f/1.8 main sensor + 12MP, f/2.2 ultrawide with a 120-degree field of view + 12MP, f/2.2 telephoto with 3x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>18MP</p></td><td  ><p>12MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 6.0, NFC, <strong>eSIM only</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Face ID</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>3,692 mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>40W-60W USB-C fast charging</p><p>25W MagSafe Qi2 wireless charging</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired, 15W wireless, 4.5W reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions and weight</p></td><td  ><p>149.6 x 71.5 x 8mm; 177g</p></td><td  ><p>146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm; 162g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mist Blue, Sage, Lavender</p></td><td  ><p>Icyblue, Navy, Mint, and Silver Shadow (Coralred, Blueblack, and Pinkgold only at Samsung)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In terms of connectivity, the iPhone 17 and the Galaxy S25 both support Wi-Fi 7, 5G, satellite connectivity, and NFC.

And when there's a big group shot, Center Stage uses AI to automatically expand the view to fit everyone in.</p><p>The rear cameras are a bit less exciting — they're 48MP sensors, a main and an ultrawide.

However, both also stand out in their own way. Aside from the obvious iOS 26 vs. One UI 7 debate, these phones focus on completely different things.</p><p>The iPhone 17 clearly puts an emphasis on the cameras, making it a great option for creators or anyone who loves to take photos or videos. Yes, it has one fewer rear camera than the Galaxy S25, but its 48MP main and ultrawide cameras are top-notch. Plus, the square front-facing camera that makes it possible to capture vertical or horizontal selfies without rotating your device is a standout feature.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 has more raw power with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and it does more with it thanks to Galaxy AI and Gemini. It'll run circles around Apple Intelligence, and the smarts may even help the phone beat the iPhone 17 in gaming and intensive tasks.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either one, but if you happen to care about camera or AI features, you may want to pick the iPhone 17 or Galaxy S25, respectively.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8700225f-d3fb-405c-b2a6-5f513ad68d58">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUzL8NRPma6QXXkxvxnLYU.jpg' alt="iPhone 17 render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">iPhone 17</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>For the cameras</strong></em></p><p>Android users might notice that the iPhone 17 stands out as a camera-focused flagship.

And while I haven't jumped on the smart glasses train just yet, the new offerings from Meta have me really excited about this growing category.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is rumored to have its own AI glasses in the works, which could launch as soon as October alongside the more powerful Project Moohan XR headset. These have a lot of potential, especially as the first real competitors to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). However, with the latest generation being Meta's third attempt at smart glasses, Samsung and Google will have to play catch-up on both hardware and software to make up for lost time.</p><h2 id="all-the-right-upgrades-2">All the right upgrades</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:7680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen 2-Shiny-Cosmic-Blue-Transitions" alt="The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gQXWdYtLYGtX6voW4eBceC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="7680" height="4320" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's only been the last few years that smart glasses started taking off, and that's largely thanks to Meta. In 2021, it seemed a little strange that Meta was diving into this unproven market, but the popularity of the last-gen Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses proved that this is a winning category for the company.</p><p>Admittedly, Meta's last-gen model was the first time I was even remotely interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>. I was impressed with how they're able to identify what was in front of me while looking like something anyone could wear, unlike the early attempts of Google Glass.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were some downsides to the glasses, with the main thing being battery life. This was admittedly the biggest reason why I hadn't pulled the trigger on buying them, but Gen 2 fortunately appears to have addressed this.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y" name="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-official-lifestyle-03" alt="An official lifestyle photo of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hLZZgrhjS9KfTFuhbzSY6Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) is estimated to last up to eight hours on a single charge with mixed use. This feels perfectly sufficient for something like these, which I likely won't be using constantly aside from the occasional question, listening to music, and taking a photo or video here and there.</p><p>Meta also upped the video capture capabilities to a 3K resolution. As someone who loves to capture videos to post on my Instagram stories or Reels, this is a great upgrade. I'll likely stick to 1080p, because frankly, I don't think anything beyond that is necessary for social media, but having the option is nice.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-smart-glasses-could-be-just-as-compelling-2">Samsung's smart glasses could be just as compelling</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-vs-google-smart-glasses-sameer-teaser" alt="Android president Sameer Samat wearing Google's upcoming smart glasses with a picture of Android Central's Nick Sutrich wearing Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fLhUdnX3ScDaV7rvFNn6W3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Screen captures from The Android Show I/O Edition 2025)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've heard and seen a lot regarding Samsung's Project Moohan and Google's Android XR ambitions, but we haven't heard as much about Samsung's rumored Ray-Ban Meta competitors. It has been reported that the glasses, dubbed Project Haean, could launch with the aptly named "Samsung Galaxy Glasses" moniker and would be audio-only, featuring a camera and quick access to AI assistants.</p><p>This already sounds quite compelling to me, as Samsung has put much of its focus lately on Gemini, which is becoming a staple in my life. Gemini's more natural conversational skills, as well as features like Gemini Live, which can easily identify what it sees and even remember things for you, would fit extremely well on a pair of smart glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M" name="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" alt="Samsung and Google partnership for Android XR headsets and glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhWtJ4NipS5AKMv6WCPJ9M.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1578" height="888" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This could also give the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) a run for its money, as Samsung and Google have the ecosystem to back up Gemini's capabilities. On the one hand, Meta's services have become fairly ubiquitous, with apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp installed on hundreds of millions of smartphones, not to mention Meta AI injected into these apps (whether we like it or not). This, along with the growing popularity of Meta's glasses, gives it a good amount of mindshare among consumers.</p><p>On the other hand, Google and Samsung have been pushing Gemini's capabilities on their phones and other devices. Look at any Pixel 10 commercial and you'll see how the focus is less on the phone and more on what Gemini can do for you in your everyday life. This type of marketing is admittedly quite effective, and I imagine this would translate extremely well with Android XR glasses.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>There's also the fact that these glasses would likely have a deeper connection with Android phones than Meta's do, which is another differentiating factor that could play in Samsung's favor. Imagine getting real-time Maps directions, creating new events in Calendar, or translating a conversation with Google Translate, all without taking out your phone.</p><p>Hands-free access to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-might-use-an-iphone-but-i-cant-live-without-these-google-apps">your favorite Google apps</a> could be a huge draw over Meta.</p><h2 id="another-galaxy-ring-situation-2">Another Galaxy Ring situation?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7" name="google-glasses-ted-2025-demo-nishtha-shatia-02" alt="Samsung Project HAEAN Android XR glasses being shown off at TED 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rv3YWmGshEhegzmAfo7UJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gilberto Tadday / TED)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If Samsung wants its "Galaxy Glasses" to succeed, it's going to have to do more than rely on its name to generate sales. We're seeing Samsung dive into new product categories lately with devices like the Galaxy Ring, and while it was a valiant effort to supplant a growing market, it's still an expensive product that feels a bit like an also-ran to the Oura Ring.</p><p>Samsung will have to create a rather compelling case for why people should buy smart glasses <em>and </em>why they should choose it over Meta. For that to happen, Samsung will have to get three things right:</p><ul><li><strong>Design</strong>: They can't <em>look </em>like smart glasses if they expect people to wear them. They should also have multiple styles/colors.</li><li><strong>Battery life</strong>: Samsung hasn't always excelled in this spec, and it will have to really squeeze as much battery as it can to make them useful.</li><li><strong>Price</strong>: If they're too expensive, Samsung might as well throw in the towel to Meta.</li></ul><p>Availability is also a concern. Rumors point to a reveal of the Galaxy Glasses in October, while some indications point to a 2026 launch, which could mean even more time for Meta's glasses to hold the spotlight.</p><p>On the plus side, Google's work on Gemini has put it in a good place for integrating into smart glasses, meaning the glasses should be plenty capable. If Samsung can nail everything else above, it could properly challenge Meta's growing lineup of AI glasses and push the market further into the mainstream.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Since Google loves to prove me right, I was surprised that it has taken so long for Chrome to get its share. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/chrome-reimagined-with-ai/" target="_blank">Google just announced what's coming to Chrome</a>, and I'm even more surprised by how useful some of it actually looks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">Gemini in Chrome</a> is your new browsing assistant, and while that name is unimaginative, it reflects most of what's coming: simple tools that Google should be able to deliver without much disruption or security/privacy concerns.</p><h2 id="what-s-coming-2">What's coming</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum" name="Gemini-Era-Google.jpg" alt="The Gemini Era graphic from Google." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ncSK72n8EjwWB8GY552oum.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, Chrome is seeing only a handful of Gemini features baked in. That's fine since you're only a bookmark away from most anything Gemini can do; it's a web browser after all.</p><p>Most of them are simply an easy way to do things you could already do after 15 minutes of Googling and trying to find the right buttons. That's what makes them great; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-ai-storybook-new-level-of-imagination-bedtime-update">AI should make complex things easy</a>.</p><p>A few of my favorites are new ways to browse through your web history <em>without</em> you having to do it. The example says something like "<em>what was the website that I saw the walnut desk on last week?</em>" will work, and if so, that's awesome.</p><p>There are also some tools to help people who aren't so internet savvy (and the rest of us who think we are) by blocking web pages that try to auto-subscribe you to them or bolstering Gemini Nano's already good <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/browse-safely-with-real-time-protection-on-chrome">Safe Browsing mode</a> with the tools to block fake virus and malware warnings and the thugs that create them. I hope it works, and good riddance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.97%;"><img id="rZfj5zfRBk7ycS6AwchEqh" name="google-chrome-gemini-security-compromised-password" alt="Google's enhanced AI-backed security can help identify if a user's password has been compromised, and fix it for them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rZfj5zfRBk7ycS6AwchEqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1072" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some are less useful but still not terrible. Gemini can manage your tabs if you'd like. You can use the content of a webpage to get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-ai-overviews-led-users-astray-some-phone-numbers-are-scams-report">Search AI overviews</a> without leaving the page.

None of this was difficult to do before, and these tasks are often less than useful, but now it will be extremely easy if you'd like it to be done for you. Get to work for me, Gemini.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1071px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW" name="google-chrome-ai-mode-omnibox-ai-overview" alt="After asking AI Mode a question from Chrome's address bar, users will be given an AI Overview of answers directly on the page, via a sidebar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afxVHk2gpxTpuqSr2uPnhW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1071" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One feature that stands out from the rest is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic browsing</a>. You can tell Gemini to do something like make you an appointment to get the oil in your car changed, and it will do it for you. That sounds a lot like other things we've been told that didn't quite pan out, but maybe this time things will be different.</p><p>My real concern is that it works exactly as described and makes me an appointment at Pep Boys to change the oil in my wife's car. I don't want an appointment at Pep Boys because the service center down the road is a local business, it's closer, and it's cheaper. I also know the mechanics and technicians and trust them to do anything.</p><p>Google says you're in control and can halt the process at any time, but if I need to sit there and babysit Gemini so it does the right thing, it would be easier to just do it myself.</p><p>This is a stepping stone to bigger and maybe better things, so I won't complain too much if it plays a little wonky.</p><h2 id="when-this-is-coming-and-who-gets-to-try-it-2">When this is coming and who gets to try it?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bNSvZ9xdypYNg6mpMn2arF" name="Chrome-AI-tools" alt="A rocket with the Chrome logo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bNSvZ9xdypYNg6mpMn2arF.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some of these features are in the process of rolling out now, while others are "coming soon". It's smart to roll it out slowly and even smarter to not give a timeline, so it's what we should expect from any Google feature announcement.</p><p>For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> users, it will be here in the coming weeks with enterprise-grade data protections and controls. Unfortunately, that means Gemini won't be able to leak the Colonel's famous fried chicken recipe or anything else that's important.</p><p>It's coming to mobile users, too. Google says nothing about the mobile and desktop versions being different, so I'm going to assume the same features will be available on your phone, too. And yes, that means Gemini will be built into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/call-me-crazy-i-prefer-ios-google-chrome-app-androids">Chrome for iOS</a>, "soon", too.</p><p>Now for the part nobody likes: <strong>This is only for users in the United States who have their devices set with English as the default language</strong>. I can understand the need to test it and see what regulators think about it, but that doesn't help anyone who wants to try it and isn't eligible. It's not like there are almost a  billion users in India and Brazil, or anything, right, Google?</p><p>Having said all that, there is one thing missing from everything Google had to say: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. I know Chromebooks already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/chromebooks-finally-get-deeper-gemini-integration-and-much-more">Gemini integration</a>, so maybe this will "just work" once it comes to your account. The company makes no mention of any changes for Chromebooks or Chrome OS.</p><h2 id="i-m-surprised-2">I'm surprised</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo" name="surprise5.jpg" alt="Surprise" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n42ZGKZRbSDU4QQkHM6SFo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>I figured something like this would be coming once <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-googles-big-court-win-mean-for-us">all the courtroom dust over Chrome was settled</a>. Chrome and Search are tied together in a really deep way, and that's why web browser market share is so important to Google.</p><p>What surprised me is (what feels like) the restraint Google has shown by not throwing the AI kitchen sink into Chrome and making everyone hate it. These features all seem... reasonable. I won't use all of them, but there are several I can see myself using every day, as I do 100% of my work in the Chrome browser. Is it enough to make me want to switch my "personal time" web browser from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/latest-mozilla-firefox-update-so-important-even-department-homeland-security-says-you-should-upgrade">Firefox</a> to Chrome? It could be.</p><p>What's most important is that it won't make things worse. Nothing pops up automatically, nothing seems too intrusive or invasive, and Gemini is getting better, whether we want to admit it or not. I'm actually looking forward to this.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The user's photos show that Google is seemingly testing a small change to the menu presented when clicking on your profile icon on your TV homescreen. The user snapped a photo of Google TV's alert, stating that it's moved "your Library and Watchlist to under the profile icon."</p><p>Now, both those options are there, alongside the pre-existing "Your Services" and "Content Preferences," with the account switcher and add account icons above them.</p><p>Outside of the profile menu, Google TV's redesign in testing also revamped the navigational bar. Again, the company highlights this change, stating, "Search is now here, and we've renamed For You to Home." Google has housed these options within a pill-shaped bar with "Live" and "Apps" in there, too. However, as the publication also notes, Google TV has separated the settings menu and the screensaver option into their own pill-shaped menu next to your main content hub selection.</p><p>It's been reported that this small <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Google TV</a> homescreen redesign hit the user's device in v1.0.806977084. It's not uncommon for Google's tests to be limited, meaning only a few users ever see them at the start. It looks like that's what we're dealing with again, probably to give Google time to make any more changes (if there are any) and to receive feedback from those who got it unexpectedly.</p><h2 id="a-little-tlc-for-google-tv-2">A little TLC for Google TV</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1009px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:53.52%;"><img id="TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5" name="google-tv-homescreen-navigation-redesign-reported" alt="Google TV is supposedly testing a redesign that alters its navigational bar, including Search and changing "For You" to "Home."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TbUATMJv82wkmA6zrzxxn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1009" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.26%;"><img id="bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5" name="google-tv-profile-icon-menu-buttons-moved" alt="Google TV is reportedly testing a redesign to the profile icon menu, bringing in the Wishlist and Library options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bBkdU6vKxp9BhC4SqBgCn5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1016" height="531" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google TV is kept relatively tame in terms of updates and things to get excited for; however, we did have that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-updates-control-center-entertainment-smart-home">personal control center-esque</a> update to stare at.

This "Super Mic" makes calls clear even in very loud places. All you have to do is press the button, and the audio input switches from the buds to the case, and the case transforms into a mic.

This seems to be shaping up as an essential update showing beta users more than just a gist of what they can expect in December's Pixel feature drop.</p><p>Considering the software is in the "later-stage" beta, it brings with it new features as well as security updates. The one feature that really stands out is the ability to customize icon shapes — neat, right? It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen, and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match your preference. You can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><p>Another feature that's customer-facing is for the fitness enthusiasts; this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives users the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors, and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  The beta also introduces enhanced security features for both developers and users.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Windows users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">can sign up</a> and begin testing "Google app for Windows." According to the post, Windows users can quickly "search without switching windows or interrupting your flow" by pressing the key combo Alt+Space. Users will receive the classic rounded corner Google Search bar with a convenient Lens icon on the far-right side.</p><p>The Lens icon lets users run a search using the content on their screen, which will provide image and text translations, too.</p><p>The company goes a bit further in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/40">its Search Labs page </a>for the test. It explains that users can run web searches with the Google app for Windows and run searches through their Drive files, installed apps, and download files. AI Overviews in Search will also reportedly be present when using the app. Additionally, Search's AI Overviews will offer aid with students' homework.

The idea was that the app would gather all of Google's services into one place, so users wouldn't have to look for their email, YouTube, and more. Access to Google Photos, Messages, Sheets, and Drive was readily available from a PC's start menu. The company even had Essentials pre-loaded onto computers from HP, Envy, Pavilion, and even some Omen models.</p><p>This new Google app for Windows takes things in a new direction, as the company attempts to mirror the usefulness you'd find on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> and other Android phones.</p><p>Google recently announced that it's gearing up for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-in-chrome-browsing-with-ai-assisted-answers-security-more-announced">some major Chrome upgrades</a>, thanks to Gemini.

However, anyone who’s played poker knows it’s not always the best hand that wins. Strategy, timing, and knowing when to go all-in often matter more than the cards themselves. Apple’s September event at Apple Park was, at first glance, a showcase of a strong hand: sleek devices, bold design, and carefully crafted messaging.</p><p>But the real game runs deeper. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/5-things-apple-stole-from-android-during-the-iphone-17-event">iPhone 17 Air and Pro lineup</a> may be Apple’s “pocket aces,” but they aren’t enough on their own to drive the next wave of growth, which is Apple’s ultimate endgame. Apple’s real bet lies in three calculated moves: disciplined pricing, design-driven differentiation, and aggressive trade-in incentives. While most Android players focus on price wars and long spec sheets, Apple is counting on these three strategic moves to make the aces matter and ‘win the hand’ —  fuel a massive upgrade cycle in the year ahead.</p><h2 id="bet-1-design-driven-product-differentiation-2">Bet 1: Design-driven product differentiation  </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1183px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS" name="Tim-Cook-Apple-iPhone-17-event" alt="Tim Cook on stage at the iPhone 17 launch event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mtLPvAkmXcLurmdLHGATxS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1183" height="666" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The Air — Style Icon: </strong>Apple knows design sells, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/the-iphone-air-doesnt-matter-its-just-a-test">iPhone Air</a> is built to turn heads. Slim, lightweight, and instantly recognizable, it appeals to consumers who value aesthetics over maxed-out performance. At 5.6mm, it is slimmer than the 5.7mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and $100 cheaper.</p><p>What impressed me most was how incredibly light it felt. “It feels like Air,” I said, a sentiment echoed across Steve Jobs Theater.

This reflects Apple’s new approach: rather than size or price-based differentiation, it leans on design, style, and performance, sprinkling novelty and premium features throughout the lineup. The result is a more consistent premium feel throughout, at nearly the same price as last year.</p><h2 id="bet-2-restrained-pricing-strategy-2">Bet 2: Restrained pricing strategy </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2056px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="KDDPuBEvu52cnEVmtiF94m" name="iPhone-17-prices" alt="Prices for Apple's iPhone 17 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KDDPuBEvu52cnEVmtiF94m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2056" height="1156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/5-things-android-should-steal-from-apple-iphone-17-event">Apple’s decision not to raise prices</a> across most of its lineup is under-appreciated,  especially given inflationary pressures and higher costs driven by tariffs and accelerated supply chain shifts. Still, most models held steady while storage doubled, giving consumers more for the same cost. Even the Air delivers a premium product just under $1,000.</p><p>This restraint sends a clear message to its consumers: Apple won’t add pressure to already-stretched wallets. That promise matters more than any spec sheet in today’s inflationary climate, and it will help sustain Apple’s momentum in emerging markets where long-term growth rests.</p><p>Apple is able to lean into its scale, vertical integration, and supply chain control to make this strategy work without hurting profitability, a play most Android rivals can’t match. While competitors struggle with shrinking margins and price wars, Apple is cementing its 40% value share of the smartphone market and 70% share of the premium ($1,000+) segment.</p><h2 id="bet-3-the-upgrades-engine-2">Bet 3: The upgrades engine </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH" name="iPhone-13-Pro-Max" alt="The iPhone 13 Pro Max cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRJ5y8TqDpHiHVrJWYgvyH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this feeds into Apple’s endgame: driving a massive upgrade cycle. The Air serves as a style icon, the Pro models target heavy users, and the baseline 17 offers strong value. Stable pricing lowers upgrade friction and reinforces value, while aggressive trade-ins (up to $1,100 in the US) make upgrading a “no-brainer.” Early preorder data suggests the strategy is already working.</p><p>To top it off, over 430 million iPhones shipped in 2020–2021 are now hitting the 4–5-year mark — the typical upgrade window for iOS users per IDC. No matter what model they bought then, the iPhone 17 lineup gives them a compelling reason to trade up.</p><h2 id="the-final-hand-2">The final hand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZQqNVCFKVmxwbSfLzxUYh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For Android OEMs, this is a learning opportunity. While many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> chase spec sheets or pricing wars, Apple is playing a bigger game, a global upgrade strategy. Its mix of design differentiation, price restraint, and ecosystem lock-in pulls users forward, even when rivals match or exceed specs.</p><p>Apple’s event may not have delivered the slimmest phone in the smartphone world or the loudest AI when you stack it against Android counterparts, but its real play is subtle and powerful: the sum of design, pricing, and trade-in incentives. Every detail nudges users off older devices, lowers upgrade friction, and reignites growth in a slowing market.</p><p>Upgrades are the endgame, and Apple has gone all in.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, while this sale is for the base-level, 32GB edition of the tablet, you can also get the 64GB version for 44% off and just $10 more.</p><p>In any case, we think the Fire HD 10 is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet#section-best-tablet-for-sharing">best Fire tablet for sharing</a>, partially because it's a solid, affordable Amazon device with easy Alexa compatibility, parental controls, and a wide range of apps. Named for its touchscreen display of slightly over 10 inches, users get a Full HD resolution, around 13 hours of battery life, built-in Dolby Atmos speakers, and more—all for under $100 with this discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k" name="123 1.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tFdGigaioQMRvyNUzpN6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 10:</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25=""> <del>$139.99</del> <strong>$89.99 for Amazon's Early Prime Day Deals</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's Prime Day event <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025">is confirmed</a> for October 7 and 8, but weeks ahead of that, the retailer has launched a familiar deal: 36% off the price of the Fire HD 10 tablet. We like this tablet for its affordability (especially as it regularly gets discounted), as well as its decent-looking, 10.1-inch touchscreen. It's certainly no premium tablet, but it's a good, affordable addition to any Alexa smart home household, or to families who are looking for budget-friendly versatility.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a cheap tablet deal with easy access to Alexa voice assistance; you're planning on getting a tablet that can be used as a shared device, potentially including parental controls for family use; you want a tablet for under $100 that will still get the job done and offer decent battery life.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a premium-level tablet and you need high-level performance or an AMOLED screen; you need your tablet to have high-res cameras for meetings, photos, or videos; you aren't otherwise an Alexa user and you might prefer a device compatible with another digital ecosystem, such as Samsung or Google.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Amazon Fire HD 10</a> is our favorite Fire tablet for sharing, and there's more than one reason why. The latest generation of the lineup offers a decent 10.1-inch Full HD display, and either 32GB or 64GB storage options, both of which are on sale at the time of writing.</p><p>Plus, it comes with a built-in mic, speakers, and a 5MP selfie cam that's good enough for basic video calling (though it may not be the top pick for high-level professional meetings).</p><p>For those who need more than 64GB of storage, the HD 10 also comes with a microSD port that will allow users to get up to 1TB of expandable storage. Performance is backed by a 2x Arm Cortex-A76 Octa-Core processor and 3GB of RAM, which isn't much but should allow some multi-tasking.</p><p>Overall, it's not a bad pick for under $100, but if you can hold out for the official Prime Day sale, we can probably expect to see an even bigger discount.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting with the former, Gemini Live is now capable of using your camera to peer into the real world for assistance. This is a feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">AI had previously</a>, but Google's recent updates have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-updates-august-2025/">expanded on that exponentially</a>, empowering it with more expression and helping it to become more "visually aware."</p><p>If you're asking a question with Gemini Live using your camera, the post states the AI will highlight what "you should focus on" to guide you further. Not every Android and iOS device sports this visual assistance through Gemini Live, but Google says that's "coming soon."</p><p>For the fun times, Nano Banana has been making headlines in September. The powerful image editor within the Gemini app, which leverages Google's DeepMind, lets users get extremely whacky with their ideas, and let Gemini do the rest. There are several "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-nano-banana-examples/">use cases</a>" that have stood out this month, such as turning a photo of a cat into a pixel-world video game.</p><p>Custom Gems you've created through Gemini can now be shared, as well as using the AI in Canvas to create an app "with no coding experience."

Eagle-eyed viewers spotted a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-google-ai-surprise-bring-powerful-household-assistance">small, round speaker sitting on a side table</a> during Lando Norris’s segment, and it looked a lot like an old favorite.</p><p>Google hasn’t said a word about that mysterious smart speaker since its first appearance, but a new report may have outed it.

Meta is looking for its iPhone moment with a metaverse strategy involving VR, AR, and smart glasses, and it might just have one. Products like Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta shades are flying off the shelves, and are even starting to get mainstream attention.</p><p>A lineup of smart glasses once confined to a few Ray-Ban styles now includes new products such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a>, Oakley Meta Vanguard, and Ray-Ban Meta Display. Meta's smart glasses product offerings are becoming more varied and attainable in every way but one: accessibility. You can choose to get Meta tech in a growing assortment of eyewear brands, frames, and styles, but if your eye prescription isn't supported, you might be out of look.</p><p>To be clear, Meta is doing amazing things with accessibility for people with low vision and blindness. Be My Eyes support and commands like "Hey Meta, look and describe" use the cameras onboard smart glasses and AI to provide audio descriptions of the real world to people who couldn't otherwise see them. It's some of the most exciting accessibility technology available, powered by Meta glasses.</p><p>However, there's a community somewhere in the middle that's being underserved by Meta and its partner EssilorLuxottica. All of Meta's smart glasses have low prescription ranges, from the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ray-ban-stories-facebook-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Stories</a> to the latest Ray-Ban Meta Display. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-are-my-gadget-of-the-year-but-ill-never-wear-them-again">I fell outside those ranges in 2024</a>, and after a year of waiting for Meta to improve its offerings, I'm taking matters into my own hands and ordering custom lenses elsewhere.</p><h2 id="why-meta-s-supported-prescription-ranges-aren-t-cutting-it-2">Why Meta's supported prescription ranges aren't cutting it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg" name="Meta-2025-new-glasses-4" alt="Three Oakley Meta HSTN, three Oakley Meta Vanguard, and three Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), along with cases, sitting atop a table in various styles, along with the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses in front of them all." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WfJwTcTyjYj89WX4AsjAHg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Officially, Meta supports prescription lenses between -6.00 to +4.00 total power on the Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta HSTN. For Meta Ray-Ban Display, the prescription range is even tighter, between -4.00 to +4.00 total power. While this might feel like a step backward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> has a screen built into the right lens, presumably adding technical limitations to supporting higher-strength eye prescriptions.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> isn't available with prescription lenses at all; that isn't surprising because neither are the Oakley Sphaera frames they are based on. However, there are third-party prescription inserts available for Sphaera, so it'll be interesting to see whether they pop up for Vanguard in the future.</p><p>The reason why I'm tough on Meta for its limited support for prescription lenses is that it's an easy problem to solve. Using high-index lenses, higher prescriptions outside of Meta's currently-supported range can be made thinner, fitting into frames like Meta Ray-Ban and Meta Oakley HSTN.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP" name="Oakley-Meta-HSTN-display-shelf" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta HSTN glasses on display in all five styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ragZ7MhkemnCMNPXsKVXzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta competitors, such as Solos, offer a much wider prescription strength range of -15.00 to +10.00 when using these thin lenses. Additionally, third-party sites like GlassesUSA and Lensology are filling the gap by making custom lenses for prescriptions beyond what Meta provides through its own online shop and partner retailers.</p><p>I was hoping that, since the prescription lens problem was seemingly solved by third parties, Meta would expand support for a wider variety of prescription needs with its latest round of smart glasses announcements. There were even pre-Connect rumors of Meta glasses designed specifically for prescription lenses. Unfortunately, that didn't happen — the supported range stayed the same for Meta's basic smart glasses, and shrunk for the new display version.</p><p>I'm not sure what the holdup is for Meta in addressing this key limitation, but after waiting through the Oakley Meta launch and Connect 2025, I've decided to stop holding my breath and purchase lenses via a third-party instead.</p><p>Android Central reached out to Meta for comment regarding its prescription lens support for smart glasses and its future plans, but the company didn't immediately respond. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><h2 id="why-i-m-not-waiting-and-you-shouldn-t-either-2">Why I'm not waiting, and you shouldn't either</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-side-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses from the side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7FLKzcwSjXViD4QwaJQgmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If smart glasses are truly the future, manufacturers need to do everything they can to make them accessible to everyone. That includes people with vision correction needs who can't or don't want to wear contacts. All tech should be accessible, but if smart glasses really are the future of communication and productivity, there's even more pressure to make the form factor work for everyone.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, said during a 2025 earnings call that people without smart glasses would be at "a pretty significant cognitive disadvantage compared to other people" in the future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/30/zuckerberg-says-people-without-ai-glasses-will-be-at-a-disadvantage-in-the-future/" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>). That kind of language puts smart glasses in the realm of necessity rather than luxury, meaning that people needing glasses for basic sight shouldn't have to wait for them to become <em>smart</em>.</p><p>Instead, I ordered Oakley Meta HSTN and prescription lenses from Lensology separately to get the experience in the here and now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lensology.co.uk" target="_blank">Lensology</a> is a lens crafter based in the U.K. that specializes in "click and fit" service — you order custom lenses online and pop them into your frames when they show up at your door. I uploaded my prescription, picked Transitions lenses, and placed my order.</p><p>If all goes well, in a week or two, I'll have my prescription Oakley Meta HSTN glasses ready to wear — despite my vision-correction needs being unsupported by official Meta retail channels. While I still hope Meta one day expands its prescription lens offerings, people shouldn't have to wait to experience this essential tech, and they don't have to thanks to services like Lensology.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="80024167-89bf-44ed-b0b9-03b7d3bdaa3e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QR2XTuj5vdUaC8ZbiHtMM.jpg' alt="An official product render of brown Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its charging case"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Great smart glasses...</strong></em></p><p>...if you don't need prescription lenses or your needs fall within the supported range.

And it all starts with the most "basic" of factors, as there are few companies that can release devices that are as premium as these.</p><p>You may have a hard time telling this version from its predecessor, but that's not a detriment when we're talking about ultra-thin tablets housed in a sleek aluminum and glass design. What's also impressive is that Samsung managed to make the 14.6-inch Tab S11 Ultra even thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>, now matching up with Apple's 13-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">M4 iPad Pro</a>. Oh, and it managed to do so while also delivering a larger battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aAHo8NoVaxPv2aexFa3biW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Besides the design, Samsung also provides the best software experience among other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>. With the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra, Samsung is finally implementing some useful features, specifically with DeX. Instead of fiddling around with USB-C capture cards and adapters, "Extended Mode" lets you plug your tablet into a monitor and have the screen extended.</p><p>One feature I'm excited to get my hands on is the ability to create different "workspaces" when using DeX. Essentially, this lets you create four virtual desktops, each of which housing apps of your choosing. For example, I can have one workspace for my fantasy football apps, while another one might have Obsidian, Gmail, and Chrome.</p><p>I've been hoping to see such a feature introduced, as I usually have multiple desktops and spaces set up on my desktop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, and other computers. And with a tablet as large as the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, it truly gives you that laptop-like feeling.</p><h2 id="reasons-why-you-might-want-to-think-twice-2">Reasons why you might want to think twice</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no preamble here; the price is the biggest hurdle to overcome with the Tab S11 lineup, especially if you have the Tab S10 Plus or Ultra. The Tab S11 is a little bit of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/thinking-of-buying-a-galaxy-tab-s11-first-take-a-look-at-these-other-samsung-tablets">easier pill to swallow</a>, coming in at $799 in its base configuration. But the Tab S11 Ultra and its $1,199 price tag definitely make it more of a "luxury" purchase than anything else.</p><p>For just about the same price, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on">Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14</a> or the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/acer-makes-a-splash-at-ifa-2025-with-the-chromebook-plus-spin-514-and-new-chromeboxes">Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514</a>, and the newly released Pixel 10. Both Lenovo's and Acer's latest Chromebooks are some of the best we've ever seen, thanks to the Kompanio Ultra chip. Plus, who doesn't love getting a new phone, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> might not be as feature-rich as the Pixel 10 Pro or Pro XL, it's no slouch either.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8zgSh9N66GgEC357xrXt7o" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-7" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zgSh9N66GgEC357xrXt7o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the reason why I bring up the Chromebook is that if you opt for the tablet approach, all you're getting from Samsung is the tablet and an S Pen. Meaning that if you want a tablet that doubles as a portable workstation, you'll need to pay even more to grab a keyboard case.</p><p>Not to mention that, unlike the Tab S11, Samsung has yet to release a successor to the Book Cover Keyboard that includes the trackpad. Currently, only the Book Cover Keyboard Slim is available, which has limited viewing angles and lacks a trackpad. It might not be a big deal to some, but for others, it's rather disappointing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-Plus-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S10+ on a desk." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ppWkqUoV2Q78Crm72jAPX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing you probably noticed about the Tab S11 lineup is that Samsung decided against releasing an updated "Plus" model. While I don't care about the lack of an updated 12.4-inch version, I do care that Samsung doesn't offer either the Tab S11 or Tab S11 Ultra with cellular.</p><p>This feels like a rather silly and unnecessary omission, especially when you take into account that the International model has it. A Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra with a proper keyboard and 5G connectivity would give it a leg up on many of the best Chromebooks and Windows laptops.</p><h2 id="define-then-decide-2">Define, then decide</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Tab-S11-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 and S11 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CbbTUYWHZABsAXJqhxp5mW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can sit here and nitpick about the nuances over specs or design changes, but the reality is that the Galaxy Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra are two of the best tablets that money can buy. That's not me saying that you <em>should</em> run out and buy one, but the nitpicking shouldn't really sway your decision too much one way or the other.</p><p>What I recommend is that you identify your wants and needs from a tablet and determine how many of those boxes can be checked off. Which probably means that if you already have a Tab S10 Plus or S10 Ultra, you're probably better off saving the shekels in favor of something else new and shiny that's caught your eye. Then again, have you <em>seen</em> how thin the Tab S11 Ultra is? I mean, I want one just for that simple change alone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c608f836-365e-4c1d-b8fc-83f4aff91ea6">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YeXkwWGwqTmNY7qjfpwmYW.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra square render with S Pen"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Best of the best </strong></em></p><p>It's difficult to argue against the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra being considered the best Android tablet out there.

Thankfully, the smaller Galaxy Tab S11 is also an option. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Enjoy our content? Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Huawei isn't letting the U.S. trade ban affect its global ambitions; the brand is steadily churning out one eye-catching device after another. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-folding Mate XT</a> is the coolest phone I used, and while I was initially worried about its durability, that hasn't proven to be an issue. Similarly, Huawei's tablets are increasingly gaining momentum, and I thoroughly enjoyed using the MatePad 11.5 S and MatePad Pro 12.2.</p><p>But it's with wearables and audio products where the brand has the most potential. While the inability to use Google's services — including the Play Store — is a hindrance on phones and tablets, it isn't anywhere as much of a limitation on a smartwatch. And with the Watch Ultimate 2, Huawei is proving that it can deliver a smartwatch that outmatches the best its rivals have to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRF53rg9C2xHB7RWarm3pQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 isn't markedly different to its predecessor, with Huawei instead making useful tweaks around battery life and polishing the design. The smartwatch is going on sale alongside the Watch GT 6 and GT 6 Pro, and is coming to several global markets, including the U.K. The Watch Ultimate 2 is debuting at €999 ($1,175) for the blue model (which I'm using), and there's a black model that costs €899 ($1,057) — similar to the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and €200 more than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025</a>.</p><h2 id="design-that-s-built-to-stand-out-2">Design that's built to stand out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f7Wi4B9fe7JCtgfQDdeeEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We need to start with the design, because the Watch Ultimate 2 has a domineering presence; the massive 48.5mm watch case is designed to grab attention, and the smartwatch is available in two models: a black option, and a blue variant. The blue color has a dual-tone effect with white undertones, and it makes the watch stand out even more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6SUrC8r45cqS2H7iAsbuP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Watch Ultimate 2 has a woven fluoroelastomer band (in blue and white) as standard, and Huawei also includes a metal band in the box if you need to switch it out. Either band is of a high quality, and feel great to use. Interestingly, there's a bigger fluoroelastomer band bundled with the box that's designed to be used while diving, and the oversized design is meant to go over a wetsuit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7r8VuC65Hxxo2j74zAfSwP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7r8VuC65Hxxo2j74zAfSwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 48.5mm sizing dwarfs every other smartwatch, and even against the Garmin Fenix 8, the Watch Ultimate 2 looks outsized. I prefer wearing bigger watches, and the Watch Ultimate 2 definitely delivers on that front. The watch gets an octagonal design that's an evolution from last year, with the chassis made out of an zirconium alloy and the bezel featuring ceramic.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oF7SHB72jkPLdpT8ea2SnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4896" height="2758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bezel includes the name of the watch quite prominently — there's no mistaking that from the design anyway. There are three buttons, with one on the left and two to the right. The bottom button on the right serves as a shortcut, allowing you to pull up health data, make calls, or initiate a workout.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hhX4oA5Xah3E7GyBDM6KtP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The button up top has a built-in crown, and is used for navigating the interface. There's good feedback while navigating with the crown, and there's no lag in general. The Watch Ultimate 2 has a 1.5-inch OLED panel that's the same size as last year, and it gets LTPO 2 tech. It goes up to a maximum of 3,500 nits, which is a bit excessive. I didn't see any issues using the Watch Ultimate 2 outdoors even under harsh sunlight.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4658px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YQ4Z7f4jzwsfWzd6VHqcwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4658" height="2624" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 466 x 466 resolution is decent enough, and the size of the panel means there are no issues viewing incoming notifications from the phone. There's a good selection of watch faces, and while the inherent customizability isn't as high as other Android smartwatches, you get a good mix of choices.</p><h2 id="this-smartwatch-is-built-to-last-2">This smartwatch is built to last</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LfVSwWk3yEkoHDCxkFhayP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LfVSwWk3yEkoHDCxkFhayP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5129" height="2889" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As with other high-end smartwatches, the Watch Ultimate 2 is designed to be rugged; it works as a diving watch up to 150 meters thanks to 20 ATM water resistance. Interestingly, the techniques Huawei designed to make the watch resilient to the pressure at 150 meters allows it to withstand daily rigors much better, including soapy water and seawater ingress. Also, it has a sonar device that sends out audio pulses; obviously, I wasn't about to go diving just to test the feature, but Huawei has an above-water testing mode that lets you use it, which is just plain cool.</p><p>Golf is a big part of the smartwatch's differentiation, with Huawei providing useful guidance and course-related details. Huawei added a new antenna in the Watch Ultimate 2 with better signal strength and dual-band GPS, giving it better accuracy while on a trail or running outdoors.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aYRmstNv9eEBDGJppdBKJQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health monitoring is a core tenet of any smartwatch, and the Watch Ultimate 2 uses Huawei's new TruSense system that consists of an ECG, PPG, and pressure sensors. It also has a sensor that measures SpO2 levels with greater accuracy than other products in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MQwKgbkcAC27VawLj5GzkQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MQwKgbkcAC27VawLj5GzkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The software has plenty of parallels to what you get on most Wear OS smartwatches, even though the Watch Ultimate 2 uses Huawei's custom interface. The UI is fluid and easy to navigate, and there's plenty of customizability. One issue is that you'll need to sideload Huawei Health if you're using a Pixel device like I am; it was a bit of a hassle to get the app installed on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. This isn't a problem if you're using a Samsung, Vivo, OPPO, or Xiaomi phone, as those devices have Huawei Health in their app stores.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="f9Nai7VUNMFV7yiUnLLqzP" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f9Nai7VUNMFV7yiUnLLqzP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only other problem is that I wasn't able to add my cards to the smartwatch, but that could just be down to me being in India. Otherwise, it has been enjoyable to use the Watch Ultimate 2, and it is better than the Galaxy Watch Ultra in daily use. I got better battery life as well, with the watch easily lasting over two days even with heavy use, extending to three days with medium use. That's a huge uptick from most smartwatches I have on hand, and only the Fenix 8 lasts longer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ" name="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2" alt="Huawei Watch Ultimate 2 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SFViTuN3eJ2jcLC7cDMgbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Overall, the Watch Ultimate 2 is a terrific choice if you need a high-end smartwatch that's loaded with features. It has good activity and health monitoring, but that's a given in any smartwatch in this category. The massive size makes it easily stand out, and the bright OLED panel along with fluid software and standout battery life gives it a distinct edge.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://google.com/preferences/source?q="><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>When Google first revealed the Pixel 10 series, most applauded the Android brand for being the first mainstream one to adopt Qi2 magnets. Others celebrated the improved Tensor G5 processor, the faster charging, or the larger battery capacities. Overall, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro</a> seemed like a hit, but I was skeptical for one reason: the thickness and weight of the device.</p><p>Google Pixel phones have long jam-packed features and battery life into chunky form factors, but the Pixel 10 Pro felt like a step too far. At 8.6mm thick and weighing 207 grams, the Pixel 10 Pro dwarfed competing options from Samsung and Apple, adding a tenth of a millimeter and seven grams to the already-huge Pixel 9 Pro. To me, it was a dealbreaker.</p><p>Then, Apple did the unexpected and made the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max thicker and heavier than basically any competitor on the market — including the Pixel 10 Pro and XL, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. I haven't exactly changed my tune, but the iPhone 17 Pro series' gargantuan dimensions have certainly made me appreciate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">the Pixel 10 Pro and XL models</a> more.</p><h2 id="iphone-air-is-hiding-the-iphone-17-pro-s-shockingly-large-build-2">iPhone Air is hiding the iPhone 17 Pro's shockingly-large build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1197px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh" name="iPhone-17-Pro-side-view" alt="Side view of the iPhone 17 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3rqyCcc5VC3ZMpBFBFmmqh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1197" height="673" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're only now hearing about how huge the iPhone 17 Pro is, you're not alone. We've all been laser-focused on the iPhone Air and its polarizing nature, and that has let Apple's moves on the Pro models fly under the radar. Here's the rundown: both the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max measure 8.75mm, making them the thickest iPhones since the iPhone 5c released way back in 2013.</p><p>That doesn't include the camera <em>plateau</em>, which adds extra thickness to the overall package. Apple also added eight grams to the weight of the iPhone 17 Pro and six grams to the iPhone 17 Pro Max. In other words, these are absolutely humongous smartphones that will take up a ton of space in your hands, pockets, or bags. Compared to the 8.25mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max</a>, this is a drastic change.</p><p>I'm all for consumer choice, and there are people who'll be thrilled that the Pro models are packed with more features and more battery. There's the iPhone Air for people like me, who crave a thin and lightweight package. Then you have the iPhone 17 in the middle, and the robust Pro and Pro Max on the other end of the lineup.</p><p>It's a solid set of iPhones, but I can't help but think how much better the Google Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL look compared to the sheer size and mass of the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max.</p><h2 id="maybe-the-google-pixel-10-pro-series-isn-t-too-bad-after-all-2">Maybe the Google Pixel 10 Pro series isn't too bad after all</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="49MtiP55A8HsE63TZPgVhT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-back-02" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/49MtiP55A8HsE63TZPgVhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was easy to criticize Google when the Pixel 10 Pro was released, as it was notably larger than the iPhone 16 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Now that the iPhone 17 Pro is here and it's a behemoth, it feels different. On paper, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro have quite a bit in common — similar battery capacities, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnets</a>, and a triple-camera rear system — and yet the Pixel 10 Pro manages to be thinner and lighter.</p><p>Put simply, it makes the Pixel 10 Pro and XL look like a much more impressive design and engineering feat than they appeared just a month prior. Thinner and lighter flagship phones, like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, lack <em>something </em>that explains the discrepancy, such as magnets. Google has nearly everything Apple put in the iPhone 17 Pro, while undercutting its size and weight.</p><p>Both phones are still probably too thick and heavy for what I'd prefer to carry on a daily basis. But if you're like me and initially scoffed at the form factor and heft of Google's new phones, maybe the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max give you a better appreciation for the Pixel 10 Pro and XL.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c511ad96-db7c-49ba-8f0a-31fe8b6fd3fb">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A sneaky contender</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro isn't nearly as thin as I'd like, but it handily clears the iPhone 17 Pro when it comes to thickness and weight.

However, the company is now dipping its toes into the budget market with the announcement of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-Pocket-AIR-Mini">Pocket AIR Mini</a>.</p><p>We first learned about the handheld in early September, with only a handful of details being shared. Until now, we knew that it would share the same design as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-air-review">Pocket AIR</a>, an Android gaming handheld from 2023. AYANEO also touted the Mini as being the "world's first handheld with a brand-new 4:3 retro display."</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_jpmnTrlu3k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>With the launches of the Pocket DS and KONKR Pocket FIT out of the way, AYANEO pulled back the curtains on what the Pocket AIR Mini aims to offer. More than anything else, the most surprising aspect of the reveal was that the AIR Mini will start at just $89 for the base model. But for a limited time once pre-orders open, you'll be able to snag one for just $69.</p><p>When you take a look at the other AYANEO handhelds announced this year, it's immediately apparent why this is a big deal. For reference, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneo-pocket-s2-and-s2-pro-pre-orders-are-now-open-with-shipping-to-begin-soon">Pocket S2</a>, powered by the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, starts at $499. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ace-is-compact-powerful-and-i-cant-wait">Pocket ACE</a>, with its G3x Gen 2 chip, retails for $389 in its base configuration, and of course, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-ds-pricing-announced-along-with-a-few-surprises">Pocket DS</a> will set you back $519 once its released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4" name="ayaneo-pocket-air-mini-color-options-render" alt="AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini color options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wc8FyFmpmS5pWVsLSXbPB4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, AYANEO is apparently setting out to change the narrative as we get closer to the end of the year. The company's most recent Android handheld, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/ayaneos-konkr-pocket-fit-elite-could-set-the-bar-for-android-gaming-handhelds">KONKR Pocket FIT</a>, is actually the first from a new "budget-minded lineup. It's powered by either the G3 Gen 3, or the Snapdragon 8 Elite, and starts at either $299 or $329.</p><p>That said, the Pocket AIR Mini is an even further drop down the price bracket, and we mostly have the processor to thank. AYANEO is dipping back into the MediaTek well and pulling out an oldie, as the Helio G90T will power the AIR Mini. This offers slightly less performance than even the Helio G99, the same SoC found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a> and Pocket Micro Classic.</p><p>Here's how the rest of the specs shake out:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol empty" ></th><th  ><p>AYANEO Pocket AIR Mini</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>4.2-inch LCD, 1280 x 960, 4:3, 60Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Helio G90T</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>GPU</p></td><td  ><p>Mali-G76 MP4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>2GB / 3GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB / 64GB + microSD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4500mAh, 18W Charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Extras</p></td><td  ><p>Hall Sticks and Triggers, Audio vibration, Custom Performance Modes, Active Cooling</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Retro White, Aurora Black, Retro Power</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, the specs aren't really all that impressive at first glance.

It does have handhelds such as the Anbernic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/i-cant-stop-playing-games-with-this-clamshell-retro-handheld">RG34XXSP</a>, RG CubeXX, and RG40XXV, but those are all running custom firmware based on Linux. Meanwhile, it's cheapest Android handheld released in the past year is a tie between the RG406V from last November, and the forthcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/anbernics-next-gaming-handheld-strikes-a-nice-balance-between-budget-and-flagship">RG476H</a>, both retailing for $165.</p><p>From there, AYANEO's next biggest competition comes from the Retroid Pocket Classic. This arrived alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Pocket Flip 2</a>, is powered by the Snapdragon G1 Gen 2.

And frankly, it comes at the perfect time, as we're seeing the cost of high-end handhelds skyrocket for a variety of reasons. In doing so, AYANEO might also be positioning itself as a "one-stop-shop" for all of your gaming handheld needs, regardless of what price bracket you're shopping in.</p><p>Those interested in the Pocket AIR Mini can head over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/product/AYANEO-Pocket-AIR-Mini">landing page</a> and sign up to be notified as to when it will be made available.

Now, according to a recent report, Samsung will be bringing this new form factor to the U.S. market. A "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/09/18/tech/samsung-trifold-phone-galaxy-s26-edge">told CNN</a> that the U.S. has been a part of their launch discussions.</p><p>Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone only in South Korea first, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. The company has historically introduced new devices, such as the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6"> Galaxy Z Fold 6 special edition</a>, or an experimental device in limited markets like South Korea and China, before a wider release.</p><p>However, it could be switching things up with the Trifold by simultaneously launching it in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Previous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-trifolding-phone-might-debut-as-soon-as-this-month">launch rumors</a> about the "Galaxy Z TriFold" suggest that Samsung is planning to host another Galaxy Unpacked event in South Korea on September 29 to introduce some new devices. The leak claims that Samsung will also launch its first-ever XR headset (codenamed Project Moohan) and its first pair of AI glasses, reportedly called Galaxy Glasses, during the event.</p><p>As for launching the TriFold in the U.S., Samsung could be trying to one-up Apple, as it is yet to launch a foldable, while this Korean OEM is ready to bring out a device that folds not just once, but inward from both sides, and not bringing it to a wider market would be a shame.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag. We are still seeing conflicting launch details, with some suggesting the end of this month, while others say the trifold will arrive only in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vats explicitly states that these are the "first test builds" Samsung has crafted using its latest flagship series.

The choices could be given on a dedicated splash screen, with each option available to tap before moving on to other new device setup items. Currently, after turning on your Galaxy device for the first time, you need to dive into its Settings to change your navigational preference.</p><p>This change would be a welcome one if Samsung is truly looking to do so.</p><p>We're putting One UI 8.5 to the side for now and getting starry-eyed at Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/one-ui-8-expands-finally-for-galaxy-s25-and-foldables-ai-features-and-enhanced-security">official launch of One UI 8</a> (Android 16).

To begin, the patch reportedly adds the option for Kindle users to alter the font size of their device's UI.</p><p>The publication spotted this new capability in the Screen and Brightness settings.</p><p>When it comes to reading, the newest patch is rolling out a text spacing settings option. Sometimes the spacing of sentences on the page helps with readability, which is what Amazon's update aims to help users with. The post states that, within the "Aa" settings menu of an ebook, users can edit the line, paragraph, word, and character spacing. Users can even lock their Kindle in portrait or landscape mode, so your reading material doesn't morph on you when you're getting comfortable in that blanket.</p><p>While those feature additions are the core of this new update this month, the publication highlights an expansion of Amazon's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=122146457011">Kindle Assistive Reader</a>.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should">set Android Central as a preferred source</a> in Google Search so you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>I have over two dozen Bluetooth speakers in my house, but I've always been interested in Marshall gear. I bought the Stanmore a decade ago, and it has served me well over the years — I still use it regularly, and it sounds fabulous. I also enjoy using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/marshall-kilburn-ii-review">Kilburn II</a>, and as good as it is, it isn't the most portable.</p><p>That's where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/marshall-emberton-iii-review">Emberton III</a> comes in. It isn't the smallest Marshall speaker — that's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Willen-Bluetooth-Portable-Speaker/dp/B0DD7T8H2Q">Willen II</a> — but its inherent portability gives it a distinct advantage. Coming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/dp/B0DDCJMDJC">in at $149 on Amazon</a>, it's much more affordable than Marshall's other speakers. The sizing is a key part of why I like the Emberton III so much, and in the last two months, I used the speaker more than just about any other.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Q5xqSZgJtbqdVfX65CPvA5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5xqSZgJtbqdVfX65CPvA5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Marshall's speakers have a distinctive design that's similar to the brand's iconic amps, and the Emberton III is no different. I like that the brand ported the design aesthetic into a smaller form factor, and the metal grille at the front with the embossed Marshall logo allows the Emberton III to stand out visually.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKghGtdXfqVPE2ecECiVj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But you're not buying it for the looks; the sound quality is where the Emberton III comes into its own. The speaker produces 20W of sound via two 10W full-range drivers, and there are dual passive radiators as well. Now, 20W may not seem like a lot when there are portable speakers like the Tribit StormBox Blast 2 that go up to 200W, but the Emberton III cleverly utilizes the internal design to produce a much louder sound than the hardware suggests.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taVrkrSFcNsqFpNiHQKaa5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is that the Emberton III punches well above its weight when it comes to how loud it gets; most of the time, I didn't have to increase the volume beyond 60%. The sound quality is quintessential Marshall; there's a pronounced bass with a tight sub-bass that sounds delightful, detailed mid-range that lets vocals and ensemble instruments shine, and clean treble without any sibilance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4822px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7W98pLjkUzvq3ayHS6zm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4822" height="2716" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The drivers are angled within the chassis, so you get a stereo soundstage that's immersive. While there are no toggles to change the bass and treble levels like on the Stanmore, you can use the Marshall app to switch between three EQ modes. It isn't as configurable, but if you need to double down on the bass, there's an EQ setting that lets you do just that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rq2asogojbiGY8oXwgRtE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Basically, the Emberton III sounds as good as it looks, and I was constantly impressed by its performance in this area. It's hard to pull off something like this in an enclosure that's just 160mm wide and 1.2lb in weight, and Marshall did a terrific job overall. The smaller size makes it easier to take the Emberton III anywhere, and the design is clearly built to last. The speaker took its share of tumbles in the last two months, and it came away unscathed.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CUbSYknbmZDoWu2tFgCEf5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are other niceties; the Emberton III gets IP67 ingress protection, making it ideal to use at the pool or the shower. There's a built-in mic that lets you take calls on the speaker, and that's a decent addition. You also get good onboard controls; there's a multi-function knob at the top that lets you adjust volume, play or pause media, and go forward or back. The dedicated Bluetooth button puts the Emberton III into pairing mode, you get a power button, and there's a battery life indicator.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5" name="Marshall Emberton III" alt="Marshall Emberton III testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MNxUhw9zz4obyd7KM95kE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life is pretty great too; I got over 24 hours of use with the volume turned up, and that's better than most other speakers in this category.

Zuckerberg focused on smart glasses and signaled that Meta will shift its VR focus to 3D media like Avatar. But in my time at Connect, it only took a few minutes of Star Wars podracing, Dungeons & Dragons battles, and Deadpool carnage to remind me of VR gaming's magical effect on me.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Demoing the Meta Ray-Ban Displays</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">running with the Oakley Meta Vanguards</a> was exciting. It's just a different kind of excitement, focused on convenience and blending technology into your everyday experience or workouts.</p><p>When I dove into the demo for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/star-wars-beyond-victory/9460903453969753">Star Wars: Beyond Victory</a>, though, I was transported back into childhood memories of podracing on the N64 or playing with my little Star Wars collectible figurines.

But it doesn't put you inside a cockpit in first-person view, as you might expect for VR; instead, it's more of a top-down racing style where you have to react quickly to obstacles and power-ups floating into the play space.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RpTaz7BB3zUCUHNLhqhByA" name="Star-Wars-Beyond-Victory-podrace" alt="A gameplay screenshot from Star Wars: Beyond Victory, showing a podrace on a barren planet with a live leaderboard." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RpTaz7BB3zUCUHNLhqhByA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ILM)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fans of the N64 game might have preferred a first-person game with cockpit immersion, similar to Squadrons.

That's why I'm in love with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/KraftGeek-Phone-Holder-Selfie-Stick/dp/B0CSFTLP2N"><strong>this 3-in-1 magnetic camera grip from KraftGeek</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>The grip magnetically attaches to the back of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> (any model) and makes your smartphone suddenly feel like a professional camera. It has a lovely, grippy texture on the grip, which gives you a much more ergonomic way to take pictures with your phone. The little button on top is a Bluetooth shutter button, so all you need to do is pair it with your Pixel, and it works without any configuration at all.</p><p>What's best about it is that the button doesn't take much effort to press. You click it in, for sure, but it's not enough of a depress to shake your phone. If you've ever tried to take a picture with the volume button on your phone and found the photo ended up blurry, that's because the volume button takes too much pressure to depress. Not this shutter button.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/october-amazon-prime-day-big-deal-days-faq-2025"><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see FAQ and deal predictions</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8dbf869f-1aa5-417d-a27d-3675a72137af" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This 3-in-1 magnetic camera grip makes your phone feel more like a professional camera with an ergonomic handle, physical shutter button, and magnetic connector.

You can even mount it to a traditional tripod via a standard tripod screw on the bottom of the grip.</p><p>So where does the "3-in-1" part come in? I'm glad you asked. The center portion of the grip, where it magnetically attaches to your phone, is a 5,000mAh power bank that'll wirelessly charge your Pixel 10. If you had it connected all day, it would double your phone's battery life, but who wants to have a grip attached to their phone all day? Not me.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8oJm6McexrvRSSVa6FQ6xH" name="kraftgeek-magnetic-camera-grip-pixel-10-pro-02" alt="A KraftGeek magnetic camera grip attached to a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8oJm6McexrvRSSVa6FQ6xH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ekg2bo3JHhxvfkzE5rGwuH" name="kraftgeek-magnetic-camera-grip-pixel-10-pro-back-rubber-pads" alt="The back of a KraftGeek magnetic camera grip with its rubber pads and magnetic connector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ekg2bo3JHhxvfkzE5rGwuH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BvZCymYHLyXwZnLoQR3WsH" name="kraftgeek-magnetic-camera-grip-pixel-10-pro-bottom" alt="The bottom of a KraftGeek magnetic camera grip showing its USB-C port and standard tripod screw mount" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BvZCymYHLyXwZnLoQR3WsH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b8Ti8wWTnJmgCHEKoaQNrH" name="kraftgeek-magnetic-camera-grip-pixel-10-pro-top" alt="A KraftGeek magnetic camera grip attached to a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b8Ti8wWTnJmgCHEKoaQNrH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bjs9So2Lzt4Ef8R2EV2fnH" name="kraftgeek-magnetic-camera-grip-pixel-10-pro-charging-stand" alt="A KraftGeek magnetic camera grip attached to a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, using the Pixel 10 Screensaver function while wirelessly charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bjs9So2Lzt4Ef8R2EV2fnH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>That's why it's great that the third function serves as a magnetically charging phone stand.

Let's go over what's great first.</p><p>My goal with this tripod was to find one that would fit in my backpack for work trips. It's annoying to carry a giant tripod separately to events, so this one perfectly fits that goal. It's a 13-inch rod when completely closed, and that's easy to fit in a bag. Then you unfold the three legs and set it down, and the magic begins.</p><p>The top of the tripod extends upward to a ridiculously impressive 66 inches (nearly as tall as me). The phone then magnetically snaps on the top, and you can rotate your phone to use either landscape or portrait mode (or any angle) easily since it's all magnetic.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cb980e8d-e566-4e24-8046-d2401d3438f8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Going on a trip but don't have room for a big old tripod?

Just like the grip I talked about above, you pair the remote to your phone, and the button takes a photo or starts/stops a video.</p><p>Now, while I <em>do</em> use this thing every day (and on every trip I've taken this summer), I wish it were a little sturdier than fully extended. I recommend using the remote shutter if you plan to have it 5ft tall, because even tapping the shutter button on your phone will make it wobbly. Not wobbly like it's going to fall over, but wobbly enough to be distracting in a recorded video.</p><p>I also wish the head would rotate like a traditional tripod. It tilts nearly a full 180 degrees back and forth, but it doesn't really rotate at all, making some uses a bit limited. If neither of those things bothers you, though, this is a phenomenal travel tripod that you're going to love.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The problem is that it's also quite expensive. Buy this 16-inch model with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage and you'll score a straight $400 off your purchase.

The super-thin and lightweight design means that the Galaxy Book 5 Pro is perfect for travel (even if the 16-inch model is a bit on the larger size), while the 3K AMOLED touchscreen display is an absolute joy to behold. And again, despite the sturdy all-metal construction, the 16-inch Galaxy Book 5 Pro clocks in at just under 3.5 pounds. </p><p>The Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) processors deliver consistently powerful performance that's fast enough for both work and play (or both at the same time), plus you get a large battery that regularly lasts me over a day on a single charge. </p><p>Furthermore, the Galaxy Book 5 Pro boasts plenty of ports for all of your devices, including HDMI, two USB-Cs, and a microSD slot. There's even a USB-A port, which Apple ditched on its laptops years ago. This particular model also comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. </p><p>Indeed, there's not a lot of bad stuff to say about the Galaxy Book 5 Pro, and anything I write here will probably just come off as nitpicky. No, it doesn't have a convertible design; no, it doesn't have a backlit keyboard. But I don't consider those features to be must-haves anyway.</p><p>Whether it's the absolute <em>best laptop for you</em> might be another story. After all, even with a $400 discount, spending $1,249.99 on any device nowadays is a significant investment. </p><p>Depending on your needs, you could get an equally-great experience for much less cash by investing in one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">best Chromebooks</a> or a premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a>. But if you've already looked around and discovered that the Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro is for you, I wouldn't wait to make your purchase. </p> ]]></dc:content>

These are an upgrade over Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), as they provide an in-lens display, more advanced camera features, and an included neural band for gesture support.</p><p>Notably, the name begins with Meta instead of Ray-Ban this time around, signalling that these glasses are more focused on capability than style — although they still sport much sleeker, Ray-Ban style frames than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a>.</p><p>Meta is getting a leg-up on Google and Amazon in a big way with this release, as it marks the first time Meta is shipping a pair of smart glasses with a display. That display turns this into a sort of "smartwatch for your face" since it still connects to your phone, but has plenty of capability all on its own, too.</p><p>Meta also launched a more affordable pair of AI glasses called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a>, which are more focused on style with cameras and audio-based AI at the forefront, and a sportier pair called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, which is geared towards athletes who want extra-long battery life, IP67 protection, and more.

Instead, you'll need to head into a Best Buy, LensCrafters, Sunglass Hut, or Ray-Ban store to try them in person. Select Verizon stores will also carry the glasses sometime in the near future. These glasses need a bit of personalization versus the Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses, which is why Meta requires an in-store visit.</p><div ><table><caption>Meta Ray-Ban Display specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Styles</p></td><td  ><p>Wayfarer-inspired</p><p>Standard and large sizes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Shiny Black, Shiny Sand</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Lenses</p></td><td  ><p>Transitions, Prescription (-4.0 to +4.0) </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>20 deg FOV monocular display in the right lens</p><p>600 x 600 pixels, 42PPD, 90Hz, 5000-nit with auto brightness, one-way private viewing</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12MP Ultra-Wide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Photo resolution</p></td><td  ><p>3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video resolution</p></td><td  ><p>1080p+ at 30FPS (1440 x 1920 resolution)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>2X open ear speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphones</p></td><td  ><p>Custom 6-mic Array</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Magnetometer for directional awareness to enable turn by turn navigation</p><p>Integrated 6-axis IMU (accelerometer + gyroscope)</p><p>4-way active touchpad </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>32GB; about 1000 photos, 100 30-second videos</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Compatibility</p></td><td  ><p>iOS; Android</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>69g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 6 hours per charge</p><p>5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging (glasses) case</p></td><td  ><p>30 additional hours worth of charge</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging speed</p></td><td  ><p>50% in 20 minutes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band sizes</p></td><td  ><p>1, 2, 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band colors</p></td><td  ><p>Charcoal Black</p><p>Sand</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 18 hours</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Neural band durability</p></td><td  ><p>IPX7</p><p>High-performance textiles</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-design-and-features"><span>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses: Design and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-with-gesture-band-03" alt="An official lifestyle shot of someone wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kJ5kQgXutT2r9L9XHkhWD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses have a similar overall design to Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses. The biggest difference between them is the thickness of the frames, as they have to fit a display in the right lenses, plus additional computing hardware and a larger battery than the Ray-Ban Meta or Oakley Meta glasses.</p><p>In his private demo, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Android Central's Michael Hicks said</a> the thicker frames don't look like some of the other smart glasses we've seen to date. "If not for the camera cutouts, people might assume it's a stylistic choice."</p><p>The glasses feature one camera on the side of one lens and an LED indicator on the other side, giving them a uniform look. At 69g, these are just 17g heavier than Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) AI glasses, a real win for Meta and something that should help everyday comfort. Hicks noted that while they are comfortable to wear, you might want to invest in one of Meta's AI glasses for workouts, instead, as these are a bit heavy for that function.</p><div

glasses by including a display in the lower half of the right lens. This display lets you interact with the glasses in a visual way and even gives you a camera viewfinder, a key upgrade from Ray-Ban Meta glasses.</p><p>Despite being transparent, this display gets brighter than you might think. Hicks said, "Meta's team had me look at content against a sunny pavement and blue sky, and it automatically adjusted the brightness and tone so that I never had trouble with readability or colors."</p><p>You can also expect full privacy with this display, as it's impossible to see it from the other side. Only the person wearing it can see the display, and that's by design. Think of it like a one-way mirror, except here the lenses are transparent and the display is fully invisible from the outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Spotify finally making the move</a> to provide higher quality (maybe) streaming music with its new Lossless Listening feature, it's time to figure out if you should even care.</p><p>Lossless audio is technically a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-my-phone-have-dac-explaining-dacs-and-amps-smartphones-today">digital compression</a> method that reproduces the original analog sound perfectly. With the right equipment, it can be converted back to analog (speakers need this) and be an exact reproduction of the original.</p><p>Normally, you need to compress audio files so they aren't too large to stream. An uncompressed WAV file can be huge, even bigger than a video file. Lossless formats compress audio and programmatically toss out unnecessary information while keeping everything needed to recreate the original.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG" name="Bose-QC-Ultra-Gen2-Earbuds-7" alt="The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds in their case beside a phone with the Bose app open." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QTAdWzpFLPd4kgpSxRwfZG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the more practical side, lossless audio is a type of compression that provides enough information so that a human can't detect a difference from the original, but it's compressed and not identical. If it's compressing information, it's no longer an exact copy. But the term works and fits.</p><p>You might have been listening to the "practical" version of lossless audio all your life and never even knew it. CD quality is a type of lossless audio. The files are differentiated by their bitrate, and a CD-quality file is 16-bit/44.1kHz (a bitrate of 16 and a sample rate of 44.1kHz).

This is cool to know if you're into this kind of thing, but <strong>in layman's terms, lossless audio is music that should sound better and more like the original recording </strong>than a lossy file like those MP3 files you downloaded from Napster back in the day.

It's a follow-up to the Headphone 1, and seems to take a few cues from its over-ear sibling. The Nothing Ear 3 now features longer battery life, a tweaked sound, spec bumps, and a redesigned case. Is that enough to justify the upgrade to Ear 3, which is now about $30 more expensive? Let's find out.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-pricing-and-availability"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Djny4rE62qPqBoSPszEk3" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-4" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Djny4rE62qPqBoSPszEk3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After social media teasers, Nothing officially announced the Ear 3 on Sept. 18, 2025, and pre-orders are available starting now. Nothing Ear 3 costs $179 in the U.S., and is also available in the U.K. and Europe for £179 and €179, respectively. This is a slight increase in cost compared to the $149 Nothing Ear 2.</p><p>You can buy the earbuds in black or white colorways, both of which feature a transparent design and an aluminum and plastic case. Nothing Ear 3 will be generally available as of Sept. 25 on Nothing’s official website and retail partners.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-what-s-good"><span>Nothing Ear 3: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-8" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vzh52FZXSAYmdA2c2SkNNb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 1 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review"><strong>Nothing Ear 2 review</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review"><strong>Nothing Ear review</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Nothing kept the hardware consistent between Ear 1 and Ear 2 in terms of audio delivery, but that's overhauled with Ear 3. There's a new, larger pair of 12mm drivers that upgrades the sound in Ear 3. Nothing says these dynamic drivers feature a PMI dome with a thick TPU surround to add deeper bass, and I believe it. The Ear 3 fully buy into Nothing's recent sound signature, like what we saw on Headphone 1.</p><p>Whether you love this sound or think it could be better probably depends on your taste. It's not really balanced, regardless of what Nothing claims, and instead prioritizes the bass and lower frequencies more than mids and highs. Like with Headphone 1, I found vocals and high-end sounds a bit muddied and underwhelming on the stock "Balanced" EQ preset. Also like with Headphone 1, I found that switching the Ear 3's EQ preset to "Treble" nearly fixed all my qualms with the sound.</p><p>The good news is that the Nothing X app is very good, and there's a robust EQ built-in that you can use to customize the Ear 3 to your liking.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-3" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E4iK4HUmfASs4XxAFzXQ24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While prior editions of Nothing Ear products lacked wider support for high-res audio transmission, that’s finally changing on the Ear 3. There’s still no AptX support, but LDHC 5.0 is gone in favor of LDAC support. This is the right move — while LDHC 5.0 is great if your phone supports it, not every Android model does. Notably, Samsung doesn’t support LDHC but does offer LDAC, so hi-res audio will now work on way more Android phones thanks to this welcomed Ear 3 change.</p><p>That’s just one part of the Ear 3’s connectivity upgrades. Bluetooth 5.3 is swapped for 5.4, and there’s a low-latency mode that cuts the wireless audio delay down to under 120ms. This will come in handy for gaming, and matches competing features from OnePlus and Samsung. Ear 3 also supports Google Fast Pair and Microsoft Swift Pair for near-instant connection with Android and Windows devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-10" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kfQZUeYbqfbgvzzBWVQEZb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery life was another drawback that came with using Nothing Ear 1 and 2, however, Ear 3 significantly improves the situation. You get up to 5.5 hours of listening time out of each earbud, and that’s with the Adaptive ANC mode turned on. The charging case, which supports wireless charging and USB-C, brings the total to 22 hours. There is one battery life “catch” that we’ll get to later.</p><p>Nothing’s big bet with Ear 3 has nothing to do with the earbuds themselves. It added a dual-microphone system to the Ear 3 charging case, and the brand calls it “Super Mic.” There’s a TALK button on the case that, when pressed, switches the audio input from the earbuds themselves to the case. It’s designed for calls and voice memos, and you can use it for longer sessions by double-pressing the TALK key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-6" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BsoEoXVsPdpmw2tdjuyNu.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly, I think there’s a demand for this. It’s not uncommon to see people use wired earbuds or headsets because wired mic quality is just so much better than what we get from wireless earbuds. Nothing Ear 3 flips that notion on its head by adding a mic system to the case that’s better than what you’d get on wireless earbuds or your phone.</p><p>Switching between the Ear 3 mics and Super Mic on calls, people I talked to immediately noticed the difference, picking up on the extra loudness and crispness of my voice, as well as the separation between my voice and loud environments. As someone who owns the DJI Mic 3 — the pinnacle of wireless lavaliere microphones — and <em>never</em> uses it because I don’t have it with me when I need it, the Ear 3’s Super Mic is shockingly appealing to me.</p><p>Super Mic isn’t the only change to the Nothing Ear 3 case — it’s also partially made out of aluminum. That adds a premium feel to Ear products that can end up feeling cheaper with only plastic materials. The entire package is IP54-rated against dust, sweat, and water ingress, and the company says the aluminum case helps protect the Super Mic hardware inside. I personally think the silver aluminum case is stunning on the white variant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-5" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/794ZZtV5gQeWxwwLJd4W83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are some exclusives you get when pairing Ear 3 with a Nothing phone, and they’re pretty neat. You can save voice recordings to Essential Space merely by pressing TALK and, well, talking. It’s also possible to trigger ChatGPT by double-pinching Ear 3 for quick AI questions. For people without a Nothing phone, that gesture will activate Gemini, Siri, or your preferred voice assistant.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-what-s-not-good"><span>Nothing Ear 3: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xeyZuLwYpBhrbZQHzxZ2ta" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-7" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xeyZuLwYpBhrbZQHzxZ2ta.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buyer's guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds"><strong>Best wireless earbuds</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/best-wireless-earbuds-for-noise-cancellation-2025"><strong>Best ANC earbuds</strong></a></p></div></div><p>I may be picky, but I wasn’t impressed by the ANC quality on the Nothing Ear 3. The ventilation isn’t as good as I would like, creating unwanted pressure and discomfort in some situations with ANC enabled. Nothing says its real-time adaptive ANC can cancel up to 45dB of sound, which is about the same as Ear 2.</p><p>Transparency mode was the dealbreaker for me, as I depend on this feature for two main tasks: ordering and talking on the phone. I need to be able to tell a flight attendant what I’d like to drink without taking out my earbuds, and hear my voice clearly while on the phone to keep my volume in check. The Nothing Ear 3 struggled to pass these tests, weirdly amplifying background voices while seeming to block out my own — likely because transparency mode wasn’t strong enough to overcome the passive noise canceling from the earbuds.</p><p>I still think you can justify buying Ear 3 if you don’t care about ANC features or use them often, and battery life jumps up to 10 hours in that case. But if ANC and transparency modes are must-haves, there are better options at this price point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-11" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntUt2f6PS92DhxMhLjcqzb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned that battery life is finally improved, and it is. But if you want to use LDAC with ANC at the same time, battery life is cut to just 3.5 hours on each bud. On some devices, you’ll need to enable LDAC in the Nothing X app, restart the buds, and then also enable LDAC in your phone’s settings app — a complicated process for those who want hi-res audio.</p><p>Speaking of limitations, I wish Super Mic worked with native Android or iOS video recording. Using the default camera app, a phone will always use its own mics for videos instead. This is a bummer, though it can be rectified by using third-party video recording apps like Blackmagic.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-competition"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-2" alt="Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hYp6w4jLG6GqS5pwMqgiX3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Nothing Ear 1 (left) beside Ear 2 (middle) and Ear 3 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The case for the Nothing Ear 3 starts to get dicey when you consider the competition it’ll face at the $180 price point. It’s not a major price increase compared to Ear 2, but the price hike means Ear 3 will face “Pro” earbuds. The AirPods Pro 2, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are all fairly easy to find under $200 if you’re patient enough, as there are near-constant deals on them. I’d take all three of those pairs over the Ear 3, simply because they each sound fuller, richer, and have better ANC.</p><p>For what it’s worth, the Ear 3 could eventually see discounts of its own to level the playing field. For now, Nothing’s decision to shift the price from $150 to $180 ends up putting the Ear 3 in the same realm as the upper echelon of truly-wireless earbuds.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-ear-3-should-you-buy-them"><span>Nothing Ear 3: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa" name="Nothing-Ear-3-Review-9" alt="The Nothing Ear 3 in a white and silver aluminum colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYphpVXK5CNDW8uCXuL2pa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have a Nothing phone or love the brand's design ethos</li><li>You like Nothing's signature, bass-heavy sound</li><li>You don't depend on strong ANC or transparency mode</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy these if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have Ear 1 or Ear 2 and aren't compelled by the upgrades</li><li>Outstanding ANC and transparency modes are must-have features</li><li>You don't want to spent time tuning the Ear 3 via the app's EQ</li></ul><p>Nothing overhauled the Ear 3, bringing new solutions to old problems — and creating some new ones.

This seems to be shaping up as an important update showing beta users more than just a gist of what they can expect in December's Pixel feature drop.</p><p>This beta, Google says, brings the Android 16 QPR2 to what's called "Platform stability," an important milestone in the development cycle, and the software has been refined and tweaked for general use.</p><p>Considering the software is in the "later-stage" beta, it brings with it new features as well as security updates. The one feature that really stands out is the ability to customize icon shapes— neat, right? It gives users more control over how they'd like to customize their home screen, and you can select from a variety of different icon styles that match your preference. You can even turn your apps into tiny flower blobs or cookies.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.14%;"><img id="seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8" name="Android-16-QPR2-Beta-2" alt="Android 16 QPR2 Beta 2 is here" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/seEQHbRTSS2JgoXuuykuD8.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1154" height="694" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another feature that's customer-facing is for the fitness enthusiasts; this beta introduces upgrades to Health Connect on the device. It gives users the ability to seamlessly track their steps using the device's sensors, and Google notes that this feature won't cause your battery to drain as much.  Furthermore, the data types for exercises have also been expanded to include information metrics such as weight, set index, and Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE), which allows users to effectively track their workout progression.</p><p>On the developer's side of things, Google is tightening up security by introducing developer verification, which will become a requirement for app installation in certain regions starting in September 2026. This makes app installation on Android much safer by preventing the spread of malware and scams, considering the tech giant had to delete several apps earlier this year as they were impacted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed">widespread Ad scam</a>. And ever since, the company has been ramping up efforts to keep the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-play-store-is-losing-apps">app ecosystem safe.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V" name="Google-Pixel-10-Android-16-7" alt="Pixel 10 and Galaxy S25 Plus Quick Settings editor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EanvkdzoHDSkmWMHY55N2V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of security, this update also enhances SMS OTP protection for users by preventing OTP hijacking by delaying the delivery of messages containing an SMS retriever hash for three hours for most apps. This means that if a malicious app is waiting to "catch" the OTP, it won't receive it immediately.</p><p>The beta is available for devices from the Pixel 6 to the latest Pixel 10 series, and also includes the Pixel Tablet and Pixel Fold. Beta users will be able to download this via an over-the-air update on their devices.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2f023cba-a427-4acc-a3cb-4ea46978cd63">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A new standard</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 10 is one of the smartest phones you can buy thanks to the Tensor G5 chip and new Gemini AI features like Camera Coach and Magic Cue.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The company's on-device description of the feature states this AI will answer questions "about your activity, sleep, nutrition, stress, or energy score." This AI assistant, which is reportedly running off Samsung's Galaxy AI software, will let users chat with it. The company's early test states its Health Assistant will leverage your "chat history" and "health trends" to answer your questions.</p><p>As the publication notes, Samsung's Health Assistant lends itself toward personalization, using your specific statistics and data to answer questions that fit your recent sleep and wellness trends.</p><p>The Health Assistant is also reportedly positioned as more of a "guide" rather than a tool to provide a diagnosis for a person's health. In a test chat, the AI responded to the publication's questions about ways to improve their sleep, which it responded with ways to calm their "sleep environment" every night. Additionally, the AI even offered upper-body workout ideas for building more muscle.</p><p>For now, there's no telling when Samsung could roll this out in its Galaxy AI chats.</p><h2 id="using-ai-virtual-assistance-2">Using AI & Virtual Assistance</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:277px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.61%;"><img id="i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD" name="samsung-health-assistant-splash-screen-test" alt="A screenshot of Samsung's Health Assistant test, informing users that they can ask the AI about their "activity, sleep, nutrition" and more for personalized answers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7mPpv7BK49r6k4ruzd2KD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="277" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:218.18%;"><img id="cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD" name="samsung-health-assistant-chat-intro-test" alt="A screenshot of the Samsung Health Assistant chat test, which lets users ask the AI about ways to improve their health using their specific data and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cUJ7JVynSa8RRP8GPajQJD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="275" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Samsung's placing its health assistance at the forefront of its devices, as a recent update for the app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-health-enhances-care">brought virtual doctor visits</a>.

The setting, captured on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>, shows a toggleable option for Call Recording, Manage Recordings, and Automatic Call Recording options. For the latter, the user notes the ability to have their Pixel automatically "record calls with non-contacts," or they can write in which numbers they'd like their device to record.</p><p>The "manage" side is simply a way for users to delete stored recordings or have their Pixel do it for them.</p><p>Google provides a little explainer about Call Recording, which states the feature will activate when on a call (if it's enabled). The company states your recorded calls will remain on your device, and it reiterates the user's ability to enable or disable the feature at any time. The interesting thing about this is that Google Pixel phones have previously lacked a Call Recording feature, which the publication points out.</p><p>However, it also picked up on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9803950?hl=en">updated Google support page</a> about Call Recording, which now fully details steps for "Always Record," "start a recording," and more. It looks like Google is truly starting to move toward a Call Recording future for its Pixel phones, but only for Pixel 6 and newer phones running Android 9 or higher.</p><h2 id="is-it-truly-on-the-way-2">Is it truly on the way?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia/comments/1ni9gt5/finally_call_recording">Finally call recording</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelUsersIndia">r/PixelUsersIndia</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Unfortunately, the user on Reddit seems to be the only one who's received this Call Recording feature on their Pixel. It is strangely appearing on the Pixel 9a first, which one would think Google would drop this on their Pixel 10 series first. Regardless, if Google is actually bringing this to users more consistently, maybe we'll have a more concrete announcement for it. Right now, Pixel 8a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> users on Reddit running Phone app v191.0.805002009 (public beta) don't see it.</p><p>It's been a while, but we were talking about Call Recording on Pixel devices five years ago, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/here-what-law-says-about-recording-phone-calls">there were some serious issues</a> Google ran into. The legality is the feature was called into question, as government and State laws were brought forward. These State laws, such as "All Party" and "One Party" States, require citizens to abide by a different set of rules. For the former, both parties on the call must recognize and be okay with the call being recorded. However, a one-party state only requires one person to know the call's going on record.</p><p>Of course, one of the ways users could keep tabs on a call and its contents <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixels-call-notes-recording-disclaimer-could-be-going-away-soon">is with Call Notes</a>. A recent APK teardown reports that Google could remove its audio disclaimer that the call is being recorded to help users remain a little stealthy. It seems that, instead of a vocal disclaimer, Call Notes could play a soft chime to let users know the call's being recorded.</p> ]]></dc:content>

More importantly, those who started signing up earlier this week got themselves into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-qpr2-beta-1-is-here">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 1</a>. This new test build rolled out shortly after the Made by Google event that brought us the Pixel 10 series. The highlights of the new beta include a dark theme expansion across Android, auto-themed icons, and new developer APIs.</p><p>This QPR2 build should evolve into Google's expected December drop for Android. Pixel 10 testers getting involved will have quite a bit of testing to do until we roll into Q4 2025.</p><p>Pixel 10 phones aren't settling for just beta access, as Google also started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-fixes-fuzzy-display-issues-on-pixel-10-and-10-pro-with-latest-ota-update">rolling out an update this week</a> to fix some problems. Performance and security were the name of the game in this update, but also a "fuzzy" display issue. This was a widely reported issue from Pixel 10 users, as a glitch would affect their displays for a few minutes and, in some cases, until the user restarted the phone.</p> ]]></dc:content>
