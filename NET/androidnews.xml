<p>SOUNDBOKS sent me an insanely large, nearly 21-kilo package last week. This box encompassed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speaker</a> of epic proportions. In fact, the speaker was so large in size and made such bold promises I decided to test it out in the field to examine its value.</p><p>I was part of a team arranging a community-centered bazaar in my town over the weekend. This presented itself as the perfect opportunity to test the SOUNDBOKS 4 speaker's prowess. I may have overestimated its capabilities by forgoing a PA system altogether in favor of this mammoth speaker at the venue. You'll find out in a bit if that was a smart decision.</p><p>Sure, 126 decibels sound loud enough for an outdoor event with hundreds of people buzzing around, buying food and other knickknacks from small businesses and vendors. But what looks good on paper hardly ever reflects perfectly in real life, so I was nervous going into this hands-on trial.</p>

<p>First off, the SOUNDBOKS 4 is by no means the cheapest wireless Bluetooth speaker of the sort on the market. You can find plenty of other 200W portable speakers priced well below its $999 price tag and from far more established brands like JBL and Logitech-owned sub-brand Ultimate Ears.</p><p>However, SOUNDBOKS brings something unbeatable to the table: a <strong>40-hour</strong> battery life on the go paired with audio that gets as loud as <strong>126 decibels</strong> thanks to its trio of 72W RMS amplifiers built-in. Even the 200W JBL Partybox 310 only manages to produce about 80 decibels of sound.</p><p>If you run out of juice, the entire battery box — or BATTERYBOKS as the brand likes to call it — slides out of the back and conveniently plugs into any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> and 65W USB-C charger for fast charging. As if that's not enough already, you can buy more of these chunky 12.8 V LiFePO4 batteries separately to always have swappable power when needed. One BATTERYBOKS will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://soundboks.com/products/batteryboks">set you back $149</a>.</p><p>You can also charge the SOUNDBOKS 4 while the BATTERYBOKS is plugged in and hooked up to the speaker. The only drawback here is that this compromises its water-proofing in doing so.</p>

<p>With a soundstage as large and capable as this, the SOUNDBOKS 4 almost sounds good enough to be a PA system replacement for outdoor events and larger parties. Not familiar with PA systems? That's an abbreviation for a public address system that consists of mixers, amplifiers, and speakers all hooked up to create one unified sound system. This kind of system is absolutely necessary for large events and gatherings, be they festivals, bazaars, conventions, parties, concerts, or markets.</p><p>Usually, a decent PA system with wide enough coverage can cost a pretty penny, starting from $500 for incredibly basic ones and going up to $10,000 for premium setups. Instead of renting out a setup like this, I decided to use the SOUNDBOKS 4 for music and announcements at our local bazaar. Since I only had one SOUNDBOKS 4, this left me with one-directional audio, which doesn't sound equally great from every angle of a field or area.</p><p>Still, there were many upsides to this. First of all, had I actually paid $999 for the SOUNDBOKS 4, it would be an investment. After hosting just two large events at $500 a pop per rental, you already get your money's worth instead of renting audio equipment. From the third event onward, it'd be free if you compare it to rental fees.</p><p>The SOUNDBOKS 4 can be paired wirelessly with other SKAA-enabled speakers or other SOUNDBOKS speakers to create a wireless stereo setup, which fixes the multi-directional audio problem.</p><p>Unfortunately, Bluetooth 5.0 means that this speaker isn't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast-ready</a>, which is a shame because not everyone has an SKAA-enabled speaker lying around. I really hope the brand refreshes this gigantic rugged Bluetooth speaker once the Bluetooth Auracast standard is readily available.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KBeeDcaHp5FXsu9zsvuGjU" name="SOUNDBOKS 4 Bluetooth speaker" alt="SOUNDBOKS 4 Bluetooth speaker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KBeeDcaHp5FXsu9zsvuGjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, if you want to connect something via cables, like a mixer, an amp, a musical instrument, or a microphone, you can do so very easily. The SOUNDBOKS 4 has one AUX in and one AUX out port, as well as dual 1/4” XLR inputs to hook up relevant audio or video equipment.</p><p>There are three connectivity modes on the speaker, and you can set up a PIN to restrict connection. This is managed through the mobile app, which is also where you can manage audio presets and access the custom equalizer.</p><p>Not to mention, the goliath has a perfectly sized hole at the bottom for mounting on a standard speaker mount. This, in effect, can help you create a wireless PA system that's also waterproof and doesn't need cables to connect, beating out the current systems that are widely used and rely on grounded sources of power or generators.</p><p>Admirably, the speaker's IP65 water-resistant rating is true to its word. Believe me, did I put that to the test? In the midst of the bazaar, heavy rain came pouring down upon my crew and me. The entire venue was nearly flooded, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 kept blasting on, pumping music to lift our (literally) dampened spirits.</p><p>My biggest qualm about the SOUNDBOKS 4 was its weight and size. Although there are handles carved into both sides of the outdoor speaker, it's way too heavy for me to carry. If you have special medical conditions that restrict you from picking up hefty loads, you'll need an extra pair of hands or two to help you transport the darn thing.</p><p>As the rain stilled and the sun came out again at the bazaar, the SOUNDBOKS 4 continued to function. It lasted through a scorching hot day, quickly becoming a storm without any technical errors. My team of organizers had originally intended to rent a PA system, but the SOUNDBOKS 4 was sufficient for music and small announcements during the event.</p><p>If you're someone who hosts big parties or events regularly, I highly recommend the SOUNDBOKS 4. This speaker sounds better from a distance, which is just nice for the outdoors. It can actually replace a PA system and bring extras to the table, such as portability and waterproofing. For best results, though, I suggest getting two of these bad boys to create a stereo sound system that's loud enough for a gathering of 200 people.</p>

Google has already done this since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, offering 7 years of updates with its newer Tensor chipsets, and Samsung offers the same software update promise with its latest phones, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">Galaxy S25 series</a>. Now, it looks like Google is trying to bring that same level of support to other phones on the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-02" alt="A Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite placard at a press event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Anqnnqgm4K2Upa6ev4RY28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, Qualcomm adds that the OEM decides whether or not a specific device will come with the extended updates. This means that it will be up to Samsung, OnePlus, or any other manufacturer to decide the level of support these phones will receive.</p><p>"We are raising the bar, providing more flexibility for our OEMs and ultimately enhancing user experiences," said Chris Patrick, Qualcomm senior vice president and general manager of mobile handsets.</p><p>This collab comes with a respite, as customers will potentially get to keep their devices for longer instead of upgrading to new phones every couple of years. This is particularly good for phones with the 7-series chips coming later this year, meaning cheaper devices could also receive extended support usually reserved for premium phones.</p><p>That said, it's a bummer that phones that older phones, the ones that don't have the latest chipsets, will not get any of these benefits, which means users may have to upgrade to recent-generation phones soon.</p><p>"Legacy platforms cannot take advantage of the extended support. Qualcomm Technologies will continue to work with OEMs on their software support needs for legacy platforms across our product lines," the presser added.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I like Dockcase's products; they have a distinct design, good connectivity options, and unique attributes — mostly revolving around the large screen that's baked into all of the brand's hubs and docking stations. The brand's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-used-dockcases-new-magsafe-ssd-enclosure-with-my-pixel-9-pro-xl-and-it-was-great">Smart MagSafe M.2 SSD Enclosure</a> built on this unique design and included an M.2 2230/2242 that can be easily connected to your phone, and I put it to good use with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>. <br><br>Dockcase is now integrating the M.2 SSD connectivity into its USB-C hubs with the Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 with M.2 SSD Enclosure. As the name suggests, the 7.-in-1 hub has a built-in M.2 slot, so you can easily add an SSD to the hub and increase its versatility. I like this idea as it makes a regular USB-C hub that much more versatile, and if you like what you're seeing, you can get your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dockcaseexplorerepro/dockcase-smart-usb-c-hub-7-in-1-with-m2-ssd-enclosure">hands on the dock for $129</a> while it's being crowdfunded at Kickstarter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zeDtSpmx5Px9uFPz3jcdLJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zeDtSpmx5Px9uFPz3jcdLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I'm wary of recommending crowdfunded projects, Dockcase has a proven history of delivering products, and it uses Kickstarter as a way to gauge demand before starting production, so there shouldn't be any inherent risk in this regard. Also, the hub will cost $179 once it goes on sale at Dockcase's website, so you're essentially saving $50 this way.</p>

<p>Anyway, let's start with the design. The Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 has the same design as other Dockcase products, so you get a black rectangular chassis made out of aluminum with a matte texture, and a large screen dominating the top. Build quality is among the best of any USB-C hub I used, and while it is a bit bigger than most hubs, it still has decent portability.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xY6uyWM2MEipHmmAeDgvSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xY6uyWM2MEipHmmAeDgvSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the hub stands out is the inclusion of the M.2 slot. It's housed within the enclosure, and you can easily slot in any standard M.2 2230 or M.2 2242 SSD in the dock, and it takes drives up to 2TB. Dockcase bundled a 128GB SK Hynix white-label SSD so I can test the hub, but I switched it out with Corsair's MP600 Mini, and it held up just as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mZy9G8eDdxFcUtscBd5sSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZy9G8eDdxFcUtscBd5sSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I like about the hub is that there's a small fan built into the enclosure, and it does a great job managing the thermals of the M.2 drive. The bottom of the hub is ventilated to allow hot air to exit the chassis, and I didn't see any issues with the drive or the enclosure getting too hot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S3izWJGL7y9J48FTSsMjSJ" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S3izWJGL7y9J48FTSsMjSJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming to connectivity, you get a USB-C port, USB-A connector, SD card reader, HDMI port, TF card reader, and a secondary USB-C connector that can be used to charge PD devices at up to 100W. The seventh port is used to connect the hub to a Windows or macOS machine via USB-C.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5BojEzNKnyemrHqqi56P8J" name="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1" alt="Dockcase Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 hub with M.2 SSD slot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BojEzNKnyemrHqqi56P8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The built-in screen has a touch interface, and you can easily see all devices plugged into the hub and change settings. It shows the status of the built-in SSD — including real-time transfers and storage left — and you can also view PD charging info. There's the ability to adjust the speed of the fan; it's on auto out of the box, but you can set it up to always be at 70% to 100% via the settings. The fan makes an audible noise, but it doesn't get too loud.</p>

<p>Overall, the Smart USB-C Hub 7-in-1 with M.2 SSD Enclosure does a good job as a USB-C hub, and the built-in M.2 slot makes it easy to add an SSD to the hub. It is a good option if you want to extend USB ports alongside the storage of your notebook (or phone) via a unified device, and at $129, it is a decent value.</p>

<ul><li>Google is updating Gemini Live to be "more dynamic and engaging," thanks to a new model, and the update is beginning to roll out.</li><li>You can check if you're using the new version of Gemini Live by viewing your Gemini Apps Activity logs.

<p>Google is beginning to roll out changes to Gemini Live it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">announced earlier this month</a>, including the "even more dynamic and engaging" conversations, albeit in limited fashion. The change was spotted by at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ixn3un/native_audio_input_in_gemini_live_just_rolled_out/" target="_blank">one Reddit user</a> on their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>. The new version of Gemini Live doesn't pack any visual changes to the UI, but it does include tweaks to data collection, which is how you can figure out whether you're using the new or old Live.</p><p>When the company previewed the changes in an email to Gemini Live users, it noted that the new version of Live would soon store "audio, video, and screen shares" in Gemini Apps Activity. As such, that's precisely how you can identify if you have received the updated Gemini Live experience (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/25/new-gemini-live-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). After opening the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> and tapping your profile image, pressing <strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong> will show a transcript if you're using the old Live.</p><p>The new version of Gemini Live includes the actual audio files from your conversation, as explained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ixn3un/native_audio_input_in_gemini_live_just_rolled_out/" target="_blank">u/evelyn_teller</a> on Reddit. "I was able to 100% verify that it was native audio input because the Google Gemini apps activity page included all the raw audio snippets of me speaking to Gemini live, with all the background noise," the Redditor explained in a comment.</p><p>The Redditor also notes that the new version of Gemini Live is "pretty good at recognizing different languages, even less common ones like my native language when I spoke it without explicitly telling that I'm switching the language."</p>

<p>As previously mentioned, this update does not appear to be widely rolling out yet. Android Central checked its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and neither had the new Gemini Live experience.</p><p>Here's how Google explained the Gemini Live changes in its original email: "Google is starting to roll out updates to Gemini to make your conversations even more dynamic and engaging...With our latest model, Live can better understand multiple languages, dialects, or accents in a single Live chat and help with your translation needs."</p><p>It's important to note that Google's privacy policy is changing as it relates to Gemini Live. With the new update, your audio inputs will be recorded and saved. Eventually, when Gemini Live supports video (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a>) and screenshares, those will be saved too.</p><p>"As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5r_VZJXj-0CEZg0HMLcsbjRwAsrOtRS1mQA5HOQpeS4OQ6iIFGQMR-3zzNz2Tr_5ni-I8y5GQRCszWKXFKIM5XYvsTiLXfOWK6QNEK2rKm2ZY1yES9axb5npns7wIgwQ8Xb6I4uynNamH2jEaM57JIRkEnqyYqnNnkGDt-5A_0" target="_blank"><strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong></a> (if it’s on)," Google explained.

<p>MediaTek is bringing consumers another tech debut; however, this one will be on deck for its MWC 2025 presence.</p><p>According to a company press release, MediaTek is introducing consumers and OEMs to its latest M90 modem for smartphones. The post states this new modem is a 5G-Advanced cellular modem solution that "aligns" with 3GPP Release 17 and the upcoming Release 18 specifications. Leading off its advancements is MediaTek's Modem AI technology. It's stated that this technology will "enhance" the modem's power efficiency and device performance.</p><p>To succeed, MediaTek states its AI models will assist the modem in identifying traffic patterns to "optimize power consumption and latency." The modem will also leverage its AI software to improve your connectivity by detecting usage scenarios and "device orientation." The M90 modem takes its AI models and incorporates them with MediaTek's Smart Antennae technology.</p><p>The Taiwanese company states this will allow the modem to boost data throughput by roughly 30% for an optimized experience.</p><p>With a focus on your data, MediaTek says the M90 modem offers a downlink performance of up to 12Gbps and boosts its uplink capabilities by 20%. The modem also supports sub-6GHz and mmWave, as well as dual 5G SIM dual-active support — with data capabilities for both.</p><p>MediaTek is integrating its satellite connectivity technology (NTN) with proper support for low-rate and high-rate data services. The modem's UltraSave tech is said to extend a device's battery life by reducing its power consumption by 18%.</p><p>The MediaTek M90 modem is still in the testing phase to ensure it meets industry standards. Samples of the new modem are expected to be available during the second half of 2025.</p>

<p>Aside from the latest modem, MediaTek was on a spree of new chipset debuts as we welcomed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">the Dimensity 7400 and 7400X</a>. Both SoCs had a strong focus on improving the gaming and AI experiences on devices that would sit right under those rocking its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">flagship 9400</a>. The 7400 pair features an octa-core configuration with MediaTek's Advanced Gaming Technology 3.0, which improves graphical performance, power-saving functions, and more.</p><p>That same announcement highlighted the company's more affordable Dimensity 6400 SoC for cheaper devices. Built on a 6nm process, the 6400 sought to improve the 5G capabilities on phones and reduce latency for users, thanks to its Bluetooth Wi-Fi HyperCoex Technology.</p>

<p>The conversation about photo editing software starts with Adobe, but the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-adobe-photoshop-on-your-phone-or-chromebook">offerings have been light on Android</a>. There's the Photoshop Express app, which is a lightweight version of Photoshop that doesn't come close to matching the feature set of the desktop counterpart. Now, Adobe is announcing a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/adobe-photoshop-camera-review-filters-and-party-tricks">version of Photoshop</a> for mobile that gets a lot closer to the full-fledged experience, with support for PSD files and unlimited layers.</p><p>The app is available on iOS starting today, with support for Android to follow. The app's functionality appears to match the capabilities of Adobe's version of Photoshop for iPad. The new mobile app includes precise selection and editing tools, including removing, recoloring, and replacing objects, according to Adobe's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/02/25/all-new-photoshop-iphone-app-reimagines-image-editing-for-mobile-creators" target="_blank">blog post</a>. There are also advanced removal tools, like the Spot Healing Brush.</p><p>The Photoshop app for mobile adds support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/adobe-express-app-launch">Adobe's generative AI suite with Firefly</a>, which includes Generative Fill, Generative Expand, and Text to Image.</p><p>"Photoshop on the phone is not intended to replace Photoshop on the desktop, particularly for Photoshop users who already harness the full power and precision of the desktop app," the company says. "While the Photoshop desktop app has deep and powerful tools that enable precision editing on larger screens, Photoshop on the phone is built to empower mobile-first creators who may just be getting started, want to create wherever they are whenever they want and may be new to Photoshop and its power."</p>

<p>When the app arrives on Android, some premium features will be locked behind a paywall. Adobe is offering a "Photoshop Mobile + Web" subscription plan cheaper than its standalone prices for Photoshop or the Photography Bundle on desktop. It's available for $8 per month or $70 per year through the Apple App Store, and a similar arrangement will presumably be available through the Google Play Store in the future.</p><p>Any of the existing Photoshop subscriptions for desktop also offer access to the new mobile and web apps, the company explains.</p><p>To be one of the first to try the Photoshop app for Android, you can sign up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://survey.adobe.com/jfe/form/SV_8e8VJGePokSHX6e" target="_blank">here</a>. The form gives users a chance to be part of the Adobe Photoshop on Android Beta, but signing up doesn't guarantee you a spot. To complete the form, you'll need to provide your phone's model number and RAM amount. This could be a sign that Adobe Photoshop for Android requires certain hardware to run, or requires certain hardware for specific features.</p><p>When it launches, the new Photoshop mobile app could be most impactful for users of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a>, which currently don't offer an alternative to the Photoshop for iPad app.</p>

<ul><li>Signs point to Samsung bringing a One UI 7 beta program to the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6.</li><li>The start of the beta program soon could mean a stable, public release is weeks or months away.</li><li>Samsung still hasn't brought One UI 7 to phones other than the new Galaxy S25 series.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's delays bringing One UI 7 to its older phones have frustrated users thus far, and things have looked extremely bleak for people using Galaxy phones other than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a>. While the company is deep into the beta program for the Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra, those are the only phones currently eligible for the One UI 7 beta. That might be changing soon, as recent signs point to Samsung prepping a beta program for its 2024 foldables.</p><p>The One UI 7 beta might soon become available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>, according to Tarun Vats on X (formerly Twitter). The Android tipster first claimed to spot One UI 7 beta builds for Fold and Flip phones on test servers in Europe and India in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1894350216700064097" target="_blank">post</a>. That was followed up by another today, Feb. 25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1894386921129881634" target="_blank">sharing</a> the official One UI 7 beta forum page that now appears on the community website for the 2024 foldables.</p><p>Notably, Vats says that the One UI 7 beta program page was created for multiple Samsung phones, including the Galaxy S23, "long ago." However, the tipster concludes that the pages launching for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6, combined with the beta build information, is a good sign that a beta program could launch soon.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More evidence of a One UI 7 beta program for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6?

The official One UI 7.0 beta forum page has been created on Samsung's community website for them. pic.twitter.com/kG7Wa9UttB<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1894386921129881634">February 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>While these moves signal that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta program</a> for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 may be on the way, it might also point to a stable, public release being a long way out. Samsung has spent months refining the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy S24 lineup — the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">currently on its fifth One UI 7 beta release</a>. The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 6 will likely need to go through this lengthy process, too.</p><p>This isn't ideal for Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 owners, who have paid top-dollar for some of Samsung's most expensive phones. Some of them have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-z-fold-z-flip/one-ui-7-release-date-delayed/td-p/11609555" target="_blank">expressed their frustration on Samsung's community forums</a> for each of the phones.</p><p>At the very least, a beta program for Samsung's foldables would be a step in the right direction toward an official release.</p>

<ul><li>MediaTek announced the launch of the Dimensity 7400 and 7400X chipsets, which focus on efficiency for gaming and AI.</li><li>With an octa-core CPU configuration, both chips focus on improving graphical performance while also leveraging AI for optimization and power saving functions.</li><li>MediaTek also highlighted the Dimensity 6400, which is designed for midrange devices with a keen eye on 5G connectivity and reducing gaming latency.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>MediaTek is bringing an all-new set of smartphone chips to consumers looking for the next generation of devices early in 2025.</p><p>The Taiwanese company stated in a press release that its debut of the Dimensity 7400 and Dimensity 7400X are built off its 4nm process for "ultra-efficiency." At their core, MediaTek states both chips are focused on delivering "advanced gaming and AI camera technology to consumers."</p><p>This kicks off with the chip's integration of an octa-core CPU setup, consisting of 4x Arm Cortex-A78 cores with a max 2.6GHz speed. Joining that quadruplet will be 4x Arm Cortex-A55 cores at 2.0GHz with the Arm Mali-G615 MC2 GPU.</p><p>Aside from its internal architecture, MediaTek states the pair of Dimensity 7400 chips use anywhere between 14% and 36% power when gaming. Moreover, the company has empowered the SoCs with MediaTek Advanced Gaming Technology 3.0 to improve graphical performance, adjust game settings via AI optimizations, reduce input lag, and enhance power-saving functions.</p><p>MediaTek makes a callback to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7300-series-chips-announcement">Dimensity 7300</a>, to which it states the 7400 and 7400X offer a 15% increase in overall performance thanks to its NPU 6.0 upgrade. The company touts the chips' capabilities to capture strong, high-quality photos, even in low-light situations. MediaTek taps <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ultra-hdr-explained">Google's Ultra HDR</a> to bring "vivid colors and better contrast for photos and videos" to devices with the 7400 and 7400X.</p><p>Speaking of, MediaTek states smartphones gearing up with the Dimensity 7400 and 7400X will arrive in Q1 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="reesBW89cKWkQPsr38YCrd" name="mediatek-dimensity-7400-soc-debut" alt="The MediaTek Dimensity 7400 and 7400X launched with sights set on Q1 2025 phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/reesBW89cKWkQPsr38YCrd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's not all as MediaTek is also highlighting the Dimensity 6400 SoC. The press release states this chip, which is the latest 6000 series addition, is designed for affordable/budget devices. With that, built off a 6nm process, the 6400 offers 2x Arm Cortex-A76 cores (2.5GHz), 6x Arm Cortex-A55 cores (2.0GHz), and the Arm Mali-G57 GPU.</p><p>MediaTek took strides toward 5G strength with the 6400, stating its Release 16 Sub-6 5G Modem supports 2CC-CA for "improved connectivity." Those leveraging a phone's Bluetooth connection will likely enjoy the Bluetooth Wi-Fi HyperCoex Technology's reduction in gaming latency by "up to 90%." The company states the Dimensity 6400 is already available for OEMs and their respective devices.</p><p>The company makes it clear that the Dimensity 7400 and 7400X are meant to "compliment" the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">flagship 9400 SoC</a> and 8400. The former debuted last October as an "enabler of AI" with a 35% power boost. MediaTek wasn't shy in highlighting the chip's major Arm Cortex-X925 with a max 3.62GHz speed. The chip also features the "Argentic AI Engine," bringing "high-quality on-device video generation" and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-dimensity-8400-is-mediateks-first-mid-range-chip-to-go-all-in-on-big-cpu-cores">8400 SoC</a> was aimed at midrange devices with an "All Big Core" design and the NPU 888 for swift generative AI tasks.</p>

<h2 id="glass-or-plastic-it-depends-on-your-use-style-2">Glass or plastic? It depends on your use style.</h2>
<p>Considering your options for the best OnePlus Watch 3 screen protectors? The first decision you have to make is between glass and plastic options. Screen guards made of plastic like TPU are extremely tough, as TPU is very difficult to tear and can repair itself due to its slightly elastic nature. Such films are also thinner than glass, offering better touch response.</p><p>On the other hand, tempered glass is shatter-proof. This is something plastic films lack. And if you invest in the right one, a sturdy 9H tempered glass screen protector won't interfere with touch sensitivity on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">excellent Wear OS watch</a> from OnePlus.</p><p>Although we haven't tested these OnePlus Watch 3 screen protectors yet, they look very promising. Almost all of them are priced below $10, so even if you're not happy with your purchase, you can try another kind of screen guard to better suit your use case or style. Generally, though, we recommend trying the NOUKAJU 4pack Screen Protector for OnePlus Watch 3 as it is very affordable, is shatter-proof, and comes with extras in the box in case you mess up the application or break one.</p>

While many are saying the phone is still too expensive given the specs it offers, especially when compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best affordable Android phones</a>, the price isn't the biggest issue for some folks. It's the display.</p>

<p>The introduction of the iPhone 16e — and subsequent retirement of the iPhone SE 3 — marks the first time in history that Apple isn't actively selling a new phone with an LCD panel. While that might sound good on the surface, it's actually a problem because Apple doesn't offer a flicker-free option for its OLED-equipped devices, meaning anyone with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a> can no longer buy a new iPhone from this day onward.</p><p>Obviously, this presents a huge opportunity for Android manufacturers to capitalize on Apple's decision, but it also represents a growing problem with modern devices. Summer 2023 brought the fear that LCD would no longer see active development — a statement that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/its-official-lcd-tvs-wont-see-any-further-development">has since been retracted</a> — but while LCD isn't <em>dead</em>, it's barely present in the market, even on budget-minded devices.</p><p>This is a problem because some users cannot use OLED displays. They cause headaches and nausea, even if the display employs a "flicker-free" solution. That often means that only the cheapest phones around — like the $200 Moto G 2025 — offer a display that's comfortable for these users.</p><p>As that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-redmi-no-longer-using-lcd-warning">pool of devices shrinks</a>, so do the usable options for these users. Soon enough, a subset of the population might not be able to use modern devices at all, which presents an obvious problem, but a few solutions could help these folks.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Apple has yet to introduce any kind of flicker-reduction accessibility option, a huge problem now that the company no longer sells LCD-equipped phones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If you don't suffer from sensitivity to flickering lights and displays, you'd be forgiven for not realizing this type of thing even exists. LED engineers have carefully crafted light bulbs and displays so that the flickering built into their function isn't visible to most people. However, the inherent nature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/testing-three-eye-friendly-display-technologies">OLED vs LCD</a> means that LCD is <em>always</em> a more comfortable option even when vast arrays of OLED comfort options are employed.</p><p>This is because an LCD is lit by a dedicated backlight that's filtered through a diffusion layer and is usually powered by its own dimming circuit. In plain English, that means an LCD's light is consistent, flicker-free (usually), and "soft." When an LCD dims, it typically lowers the voltage like a traditional light bulb.</p><p>An OLED display works differently. OLEDs have no backlight and, instead, each pixel creates its own light. This produces the stark contrast and deep colors that OLEDs are renowned for, but it also makes dimming complicated. LED light bulbs have the same problem because they use the same basic technology.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CHxhEWkkDW435TDn6jLBMo" name="oled-vs-lcd-flicker-free-chart" alt="Comparing flicker-free solutions between LCD and OLED using Opple Light Master charts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHxhEWkkDW435TDn6jLBMo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2016" height="1134" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of a consistent light source that persists through the entire brightness range, OLEDs <em>always</em> have a stark drop in brightness at the end of each visual refresh cycle. That means if an OLED display runs at 120Hz, it has 120 dips in brightness per second. Each time the OLED has to refresh its pixels and show a new image, it also needs to apply a fresh "injection" of voltage to create the image at a specific brightness level.</p><p>This drop in brightness — however minimal it may be — is simply too much flickering for some people to handle. While many friendlier OLED displays from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-display">OnePlus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magicpad-2-honor-magic-v3-ai-defocus-display">Honor</a> do a lot to reduce the amount of flickering, it's <em>impossible</em> to make a truly flicker-free OLED because of the nature of their design.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rjxTBU7FWF32BieRyxjoX5" name="moto-g-2025-lcd-01" alt="The surprisingly bright and vibrant LCD screen on the Moto G 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rjxTBU7FWF32BieRyxjoX5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you're in the group of folks who can't use OLED phones for any reason, your choices are few to none in 2025. I've been talking with several members of the PWM-sensitive community who are genuinely worried about what's going to happen over the next few years.</p><p>The problem isn't just that new phones aren't using LCDs, it's that old phones are only viable for so long. Google only allows phones to get so old before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-stops-supporting-android-lollipop-handsets">they are no longer supported</a>, and newer apps and services often only support the most recent versions of Android. Without long-term updates across Android OEMs, users who cannot use newer phones are stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>No one knows how many people are affected by this conundrum, either. While research on LED lights and displays has been picking up steam <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">over the past two years</a>, companies who research display technologies often aren't at the forefront of this research.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some people will never be able to use OLED because of the inherent brightness dip that occurs any time the display refreshes.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If anything, the validity of some research conducted by smartphone companies has been called into question. One example is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15980316.2021.1950854#d1e115">2023 smartphone PWM study</a> by a Samsung Electronics staff engineer, which claims that "at a distance of 5 cm or more, the 240 Hz band was confirmed as undistinguishable from ambient noise." Based on the study, people who are typically sensitive to PWM dimming shouldn't have any problems with OLED-based smartphones.</p><p>This study used the same 240Hz metric that Samsung OLEDs have used for years, all of which have a history of causing users headaches and other problems according to tens of thousands of users across online forums like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/">Reddit</a>, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S24/PWM-is-a-big-problem/td-p/2855833">Samsung</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254749941">Apple's</a> own community forums.</p><p>Some phones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://minimalcompany.com/">Minimal Phone</a>, offer hope for the most sensitive users but still suffer from the same problem that budget-minded Android phones have. While the cameras are good enough and the processor gets the job done, you're not going to be taking award-winning pictures or playing the latest games on any of these devices.</p><p>Still, e-Ink devices like the Minimal Phone are shown to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8212737/">safer than OLED</a> while reading, so it might be best to invest in one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">best e-Ink devices</a> and use them as often as possible. I recommend the Onyx Boox Palma 2, which runs full Android and has all the Google Play apps you want.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EW9VDBar5fvAdgGbAzMHc5" name="moto-g-2025-vegan-leather-back-02" alt="Holding the Moto G 2025 and showing off its vegan leather back and smoothly raised camera island" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EW9VDBar5fvAdgGbAzMHc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Some budget-minded phones still offer flicker-free LCD screens, but the options are dwindling with no alternative in sight.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So what are these users to do? For now, not much. Phones like the Minimal Phone offer the best chance at an eye-strain-free experience, and some of the few LCD phones left — most of Motorola's cheapest phones and that of a handful of other companies — get the basics done with little fanfare.</p><p>Companies like TCL have been trying to do something interesting with LCD technology since the introduction of the company's NXTPAPER technology, but even these are plagued with a type of color flicker known as dithering that some users are sensitive to. The upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/could-qdel-replace-oled-yes-and-it-might-happen-sooner-than-expected">TCL 60 series</a> offers a ray of hope but is also underscored by the potential that color dithering could ruin an otherwise safe display.</p><p>And while a handful of promising new technologies are on the horizon — notably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/tvs/could-qdel-replace-oled-yes-and-it-might-happen-sooner-than-expected">QDEL</a>, mini-LED, and micro-LED — we don't know enough about their integration into consumer technology to be sure yet. While the latest Macbooks employ mini-LED with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PWM_Sensitive/comments/17qfgjp/macbook_pro_1614_m3_pwm_report/">extremely high 15,000Hz PWM rate</a>, no one knows what rates QDEL and micro-LED will use or if they'll do something altogether different.</p><p>The future is sadly uncertain for anyone sensitive to light flicker. While there are rays of hope, the most sensitive group of users may have to look for screen-free lifestyle alternatives at some point in time.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> has been out since 2023, but it remains a great choice for anyone who values outstanding battery life and stylish design in their smartwatches. Straight out of the box, you&apos;ll notice the large AMOLED touchscreen display with rotating crown, but things are just as impressive under the hood. The smartwatch boasts efficient Snapdragon performance with heart rate, sleep, blood oxygen, and other useful health/fitness trackers, plus you&apos;ll enjoy up to 80 hours of battery life on a single charge. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xBE4NPZqPd93SA3FwWr2RM" name="ticwatch-pro-5-essential-mode-2.jpg" alt="Essential Mode on TicWatch Pro 5 - 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xBE4NPZqPd93SA3FwWr2RM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, the battery life is where the TicWatch Pro 5 really shines, as it&apos;s one of the first smartwatches to incorporate Essential Mode as a built-in feature. This setting lets you manually schedule (or choose to adaptively automate) when the smartwatch enters a low-energy mode, thereby conserving your battery life for when you need it most. When the watch is in Essential Mode, the display drops to a super-low brightness setting and continues to give you crucial information such as time and BPM. The TicWatch Pro 5 will also track some metrics behind the scenes, such as step count and sleep quality, for you to examine once the watch returns to its normal state.</p><p>Of course, buying a 2023 watch means you should expect to make a couple sacrifices. For one, the TicWatch Pro 5 only updated to WearOS 4 in September 2024, and it&apos;s unclear if the watch will receive any other OS updates in the future. Needless to say, you can get more power and better features by going with one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, but if you just want a smartwatch with excellent battery life and a ton of health and fitness tracking features for less than $200, this is an unmissable opportunity.</p>

<ul><li>A set of Google Pixel 9a pricing rumors claim the device will remain "the same" as the Pixel 8a across various European regions.</li><li>Those in Belgium, France, Germany, and more could see a €549 starting price while Canadian users could see a $679 start.</li><li>Rumors claim these prices concern the 128GB and 256GB options, which is also supposedly joined by 8GB of RAM.</li><li>The Pixel 9a is rumored to debut on March 26.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's next budget phone remains the culprit of another string of leaks purporting its price across various overseas regions.</p><p>This report concerns pricing leaks for several countries in Europe; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/exclusive-google-pixel-9a-pricing-europe-uk-canada-us">Android Headlines</a> states consumers in these areas will see familiar prices. According to the publication, many countries in Europe will (allegedly) see similar prices across both the Pixel 9a's 128GB and 256GB storage options.</p><p>Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain will supposedly see a €549 starting price for the 128GB configuration and a €649 tag for the 256GB choice. Prices differ in Ireland, which may see things listed at €559 and €659.</p><p>The U.K. was highlighted, with the post claiming those consumers could see the following prices: £499 (128GB) and £599 (256GB). Lastly, the publication mentions the Canadian market, which could see $679 and $809 starting prices, respectively.</p><p>It's explained that the "similarities" in pricing across the previously mentioned regions regard Google's pricing of the Pixel 8a in 2024. So, perhaps consumers in these areas won't see a drastic rise in pricing for an expected <em>budget </em>phone from Google later this year.</p>

<p>The alleged U.S. pricing was mentioned today (Feb 25), but it remains the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">as a leak from late January</a>. Rumors stated U.S. consumers could see a similar starting price as the Pixel 8a's launch, which is right around $499 for its base model and $559 for 256GB. Those rumors also claimed the next A-series Pixel could feature a small 8GB of RAM alongside both storage choices.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that these storage options don't differ from last year's budget model as Google is placing its attention elsewhere.</p><p>There was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-major-specs-render-design-changes-leaked">a major leak in mid-February</a> that placed a bright spotlight on the Pixel 9a's specs and purported hardware changes. The leak claimed the phone would feature a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate and Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> SoC. The display may fall victim to slightly thicker bezels when compared to the flagship Pixel 9 series.</p><p>More importantly, the largest design change is the dual camera array, which forgoes a thick camera bump (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">looking at you, Pixel 9</a>) in favor of one that's flush to its back. The camera strength is projected to arrive similar to the base Pixel 9 model, which boasts a 48MP primary lens with OIS and a 13MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>While Google's budget device typically launches earlier in the year (springtime), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims">rumors suggest</a> March 26 could be the date this time.</p>

<p>Clicks, the brand known for its built-in keyboard cases for iPhones, is expanding its lineup. This time, it’s bringing three fresh versions designed specifically for Android users.</p><p>Founded by MrMobile and CrackBerry Kevin, Clicks is rolling out new keyboard cases for the latest Google Pixel, Motorola Razr Plus, and Samsung Galaxy phones. Inspired by the classic BlackBerry feel, these cases bring back satisfying tactile typing, giving you more control and smoother navigation.</p><p>Currently, Clicks is launching its keyboard cases for a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android favorites</a>: the Google Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, the Motorola Razr Plus 2024, and the Samsung Galaxy S25.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> will be available in Surge and Onyx, with pre-orders starting February 25 at an introductory price of $99 until March 21, after which the price rises to $139. Shipping is expected in late April.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> (Electric, Onyx) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> cases (Pinot, Onyx) follow the same pricing, but ships in late May and June, respectively.</p><p>To set it up, just line up your phone’s charging port with the connector inside the Clicks case, slide it in, and click the top into place. Clicks powers directly through your phone, so no Bluetooth or extra battery is needed.</p>

<p>Clicks cases come with curved keys and metal dome switches for that satisfying clicky feel. Plus, the backlit keys make it easy to type no matter if you're in a dim room or out in the sun.</p><p>The company promises to make everyday tasks a breeze. Thanks to handy shortcuts, you can quickly jump into your go-to apps, AI features, notifications, and messaging tools.</p><p>However, since the Clicks case doesn’t have a magnet, MagSafe-like chargers and accessories might not stay put. Wireless charging should still do the trick without a hitch, though.</p><p>By ditching the on-screen keyboard, Clicks frees up more screen space, making content creation super smooth. Whether you're snapping selfies or editing videos, it’s a handy accessory for everyone.</p>

<p>OnePlus announced in a press release that it will be pushing the open sale of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">Watch 3 </a>to April 2025. Initially, the wearable was supposed to go on sale starting today (Feb. 25), however looks like the company buying time to rectify the typo it made on the back panel of the Watch 3.</p><p>"The delay comes as a result of a minor typographical error identified below the watch face, which the company is addressing with a new batch," OnePlus said in the presser.</p><p>For those who need to be caught up, last week, one user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1iswu8a/oneplus_watch_3_meda_in_china_misspelled_on_the/?utm_source=embedv2&utm_medium=post_embed&utm_content=post_body&embed_host_url=https://www.androidpolice.com/oneplus-watch-3-typo/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> noticed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">minor error with the wearable</a>. The company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China," on the first batch of wearables that went out.</p><p>Following mixed reactions to this hilarious typo, with some questioning how the wearable passed final quality checks, the company took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">X(formerly Twitter) </a>to put all the chatter to rest.</p><p>It stated that "a typo slipped through," and "it was totally unintentional." And if users seem to have received one that says "Meda" on the wearable, they have one of two options. They can either keep it as a 'super limited edition' or return it to the company for a brand new one — minus the typo of course.</p><p>OnePlus further thanked users for understanding, while they "get everything back in check!" Which now seems like a two month delay. While we are yet to get an exact date for open sales, it's important to note that pre-orders for the corrected device are said to run from Feb to April.</p><p>That said, OnePlus the Watch 3 looks like a major hardware <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">upgrade over the OnePlus Watch 2</a>. According to Android Central's Michael Hicks, the "active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity," takes it a notch higher than its predecessor.</p>

I generally like using foldables, and the Magic V3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3 Pro</a> combine sleek designs with great camera packages, but there isn't another foldable like the Mate XT. The tri-folding design makes it unique, and that in itself is worthy of attention. <br><br>I wasn't able to get the Chinese version of the Mate XT, but Huawei thankfully launched the foldable globally, and I headed to Malaysia to get my hands on the phone. I've used it for just over three days now, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is the most exciting phone I've used in quite a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MfxQZtwRFmru6vr9zmvatH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MfxQZtwRFmru6vr9zmvatH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The model I have is the Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design, and it comes with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Given the unique design and innovative tri-fold panel, it isn't surprising that this is the costliest phone in the world today — it costs €3,499 ($3,600), twice as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KtW8Z2WV35z96i7ZhN7otH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Mate XT is a halo product, much like NVIDIA's RTX 5090 and Audeze's CRBN2 headset. As a technical showcase, it is one of a kind, and while I wasn't sure about its durability when I got started with the device, it's holding up astonishingly well. This is the thinnest foldable around, and it makes the Find N5's 4.21mm profile look chunky. Coming in at just 3.6mm when fully unfolded, it is sleeker than just about any other device I've used recently — I can't think of any other gadget that's as sleek.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LyH3rGCtMAoyyLvHqX9irH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyH3rGCtMAoyyLvHqX9irH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The crease is visible to a greater extent than on the Find N5, but it isn't an issue in regular use. The Mate XT is relatively thick at 12.8 when folded, and at 298g, it is the heaviest phone around today. However, you don't necessarily feel that heft when using the device, and while it is thicker when fully folded, it is still pocketable — I didn't have any problems carrying it around.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hqvbPXLuHvGgwJrev6HmrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tri-fold design sees two hinges; one folds inwards, and the other outwards. This means that there's a portion of the panel on the right that doesn't have much in the way of protection, and while my unit didn't take any tumbles yet, I'm not willing to take that risk — I'm using the case bundled in the package.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="euhvtQUJapSSoQAnCD7ZwH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/euhvtQUJapSSoQAnCD7ZwH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the oversized OLED panel is the key talking point of the Mate XT, Huawei did a great job with the design of the foldable; the red model looks stunning, with the gold accents around the hinges and camera module accentuating the design very well. The leather back has a great in-hand feel, and the Mate XT isn't anywhere as unwieldy as I thought it would be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uTYcJDiFv6LCAZ9nKuwqtH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uTYcJDiFv6LCAZ9nKuwqtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The unique nature of the phone means that you can use it in three modes. The standard is the fully folded design with the outer panel, and in this configuration, you get a 6.4-inch panel with a 2232 x 1008 resolution. It is wide enough that using the cover screen wasn't a problem, and while it isn't as good as the Magic V3 or Find N5 in this regard, it's a much better sight than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p>
<p>Unfolding the Mate XT once gets you a traditional book-style inner panel that's 7.9 inches, and in this mode, it's similar in usability to most foldables around. But when you unfold once again, you get the full 10.2 inches, and the Mate XT basically transforms into a tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8ztMFwoMhjTshkUxwuxmwH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ztMFwoMhjTshkUxwuxmwH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Mate XT has a singular advantage as a media consumption device thanks to the 10.2-inch OLED panel, and it is truly incredible to stream Netflix or YouTube content. The 16:9 ratio means you don't get much letterboxing either, and content is immersive like no other device today. The fully unfolded mode is also great when it comes to reading, and it's just plain cool to have this much screen real estate on a pocketable device.</p>
<p>The panel goes up to 90Hz (not 120Hz as every other foldable), and while that is a limitation, there's still some fluidity when navigating the interface. There isn't as big a difference between 90Hz and 120Hz as there is when you go from 60Hz to 90Hz, so it wasn't an issue as such.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JcWf6YArz65rk5VpVzkLuH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JcWf6YArz65rk5VpVzkLuH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Huawei is continuing to use its own silicon, and the Mate XT is powered by the 7nm Kirin 9010. While it isn't as good as the equivalent Qualcomm or MediaTek designs, it does a decent enough job in regular use as well as gaming, and I'll go into greater detail in an additional post. <br><br>I used Huawei's Pura 70 Ultra last year, and the cameras on the Mate XT are just as good — if anything, they're among the best of any foldable around. The 50MP main camera is flanked by dual 12MP lenses, and it takes fantastic photos. Similarly, the phone has standout battery life thanks to a 5600mAh battery, and there's 66W charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8ztMFwoMhjTshkUxwuxmwH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ztMFwoMhjTshkUxwuxmwH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Software is still a huge point of contention with Huawei phones as the brand doesn't have access to Google's services. That said, installing the Play Store is pretty straightforward via GBox, and while it runs in a sandbox, you get to easily install and update anything you need without too much of a hassle. The phone has the requisite hooks made possible by microG, so if you're in the Google ecosystem, using the device is similar to just any other Android phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RA96Tj9KvwLFTpQXwWCKrH" name="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RA96Tj9KvwLFTpQXwWCKrH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Just like the RTX 5090, the Mate XT is all about bragging rights. There are other foldables that do a great job in their own right, but there isn't anything that's quite as innovative as the tri-folding device. It costs much more than any other phone today, and it isn't exactly aimed at the average user — this is an enthusiast product through and through. As such, value doesn't really come into the equation, and Huawei is instead positioning this as a tech showcase that you can actually use day-to-day.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-47">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>A new leak indicates that Google could be replacing its renowned hot word "Hey Google" with "Hey Gemini."</li><li>A deep dive into the latest Beta version of the app showcased a string with "Hey" followed by a variable that looks like a mashup of letters and variables next to it.</li><li>Google hasn't made any official announcement yet, but has been dropping several hints over the past year about this switch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems to be bolstering Gemini in every walk of life, it recently used Gemini API and AI Studio to make the I/O 2025 puzzle. However, now it's all set to replace the long-standing "Hey Google" trigger word that brought up the assistant on devices.</p><p>While recently doing a deep dive into the latest beta version of the Google app, debugging guru Shiv (or AssembleDebug)  spotted a couple of strings that looked like the hot word could change (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/googles-getting-ready-to-switch-to-new-hotword/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p><p>According to the publication, the string showed "Hey," followed by a mashup of letters and symbols next to it. However, it looks like Google is trying to hide its new hot word before announcing it publically. As seen multiple times in the string below:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-typescript" language="typescript" ><code>“Hey Google” and “Hey %1$s” require Voice Match to recognize youWithout “Hey Google” and “Hey %1$s,” you can still get help from GeminiGemini may activate accidentally in different ways, like if there’s a noise that sounds like “Hey Google” or “Hey %1$s”Learn more about the differences between “Hey %2$s” and “Hey Google”Gemini will stand by to hear “Hey Google,” “Hey %1$s,” and quick phrases like “stop” or “snooze.” For now, “Hey %1$s” is only available on some mobile devices.Turn on “Hey %1$s” to talk things out with Gemini Live and “Hey Google” for quick actions and info by voiceGo hands-free with “Hey %1$s”</code></pre>
<p>That said, this isn't surprising since Google has openly replaced "Hey Google" with "Hey Gemini" in several instances. Including when the tech giant showed off its XR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>, featuring a person interacting with the AI software and waking it by using the words "Hey Gemini."</p><p>Additionally, when Google showed off Project Astra, a multimodal future assistant during last year's I/O, dropping hints of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">possible pair of smart glasses in the works</a>, the person interacting with the assistant also seemed to be speaking with Gemini—asking it to identify objects in the office space or even a creative alliteration about a bunch of crayons. If you notice the video's subtitles, it mentions Gemini as the respondent as well.</p><p>There was even chatter about the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-week-later">Galaxy S25</a> series showcasing Gemini as the ultimate assistant rather than "Hey Google." A Brazillian news site had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tecnoblog.net/noticias/exclusivo-galaxy-s25-tem-design-cameras-e-ia-revelados-em-novo-vazamento/" target="_blank">showcased promotional material </a>of the flagship series that read "Hey Google Gemini." However, that didn't make it to the actual phone.</p>

<p>For now, at least, the assistant hasn't gone anywhere, and "Hey Google" seems to still be dwelling on our phones. However, with the upcoming I/O 2025, Google could make a public announcement about this shift, as it has been secretly working on it anyway. It will be interesting to see how Google plans on fully replacing the assistant with Gemini since some of Gemini's features are blocked behind a paywall.</p>

<p>Excitement is building as Xiaomi gears up to launch the 15 Ultra in its home market, following the footsteps of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a>. Ahead of the big reveal, the company has dropped some teasers that give us a clear look at the phone’s design.</p><p>Xiaomi has officially shared 15 Ultra design images on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/u/2202387347" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, and they’re pretty much in line with earlier leaks (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_15_ultra_officially_showcased_camera_specs_also_revealed-news-66695.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). The design is a clear shoutout to Leica’s camera style, with a back panel sporting a two-part design that rocks a pleather-like texture and a glossy finish. Topping it off is a huge circular camera module.</p>

<p>The dual-tone look is a clear nod to classic camera aesthetics. This version rocks a black-and-white combo, blending a faux leather finish with a sleek glass back. The Leica-inspired design makes perfect sense, given that the 15 Ultra’s powerful camera system comes straight from Xiaomi’s partnership with the camera brand.</p><p>Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun also shared a set of photos on X, backing up the camera-inspired look we’ve seen in earlier leaks.</p>

<p>Even though Xiaomi and Leica have been teaming up for years to fine-tune camera tech, the 15 Ultra is the first time Xiaomi has really leaned into Leica’s design style.

<p>The companies utilizing these Qualcomm products can also expect smarter decision-making, increased operational efficiency, and faster time-to-market, the company further notes in the press release. It is also believed to be "crucial for industries like energy and utilities, retail, supply chain, manufacturing, and telecom, enabling businesses to expand into new opportunities, extend their competitive edge, and win in evolving markets."</p><p>And for the Dragonwing brand logo and the stylized dragon icon it utilizes, it is believed to be symbolizing “ascension, power, and acceleration.” The colors used for the logo include "influential purple," as the company calls it; and it is a fusion of Qualcomm's popular blue and Snapdragon's bold red.</p><p>Both Dragonwing and Snapdragon aim to create a strong, purpose-built portfolio, strengthening the company’s presence in both consumer and industrial segments. More of the Dragonwing will be unveiled at MWC early next month, followed by the Embedded World event, which is scheduled for March 11-13.</p>

<p>AT&T and Verizon have pulled off their first satellite-to-phone video call using AST SpaceMobile’s BlueBird satellites, which are orbiting low Earth to help bring stronger connectivity straight to regular cell phones.</p><p>Verizon announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-ast-spacemobile-bluebird-2" target="_blank">press release</a> that it has made its first-ever video call over satellite, while AT&T <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.att.com/story/2025/ast-spacemobile-video-call.html" target="_blank">pulled off</a> a similar feat using satellite tech that’s set to roll out commercially.</p><p>AT&T and Verizon have teamed up with satellite providers—especially AST SpaceMobile—to push their networks further. AST SpaceMobile is building a space-based cellular broadband network to keep phones connected even in dead zones where traditional coverage falls short.</p><p>These trials proved that satellite and ground networks can work seamlessly together. A live video call between two phones—one connected via satellite and the other through AT&T’s and Verizon’s regular cell networks—marks a big step toward blending space tech with everyday connectivity.</p><p>AST SpaceMobile is rolling out an on-demand direct-to-device service in the U.S., tapping into Verizon and AT&T’s 850MHz spectrum. They chose this frequency because it’s perfect for connecting standard smartphones.</p><p>For these tests, both AT&T and Verizon tapped into AST SpaceMobile’s fleet of five BlueBird satellites, which were launched into orbit back in September last year.</p><p>Before these latest trials, AT&T teamed up with AST SpaceMobile for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AST_SpaceMobile/status/1894045276567998680" target="_blank">similar video call test in 2023</a>, with Rakuten Group also in the mix.</p><p>AT&T’ is optimistic about launching commercial services soon, powered by AST SpaceMobile’s BlueBird satellites.</p><p>In the U.S., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-carrier-us">wireless carriers</a> are racing to dominate the satellite communication space.

<hr>
<p>Google is making it easier to use AI to help refine developer code at no cost. Google Cloud <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://codeassist.google/" target="_blank">announced</a> today that it's adding a free tier to Gemini Code Assist, a popular AI coding assistant, that only requires a personal Google account to access. Additionally, integration with GitHub is entering public preview that aims to make code reviews easier. Compared to other free code assistants, the company says the free version of Gemini Code Assist offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/is-geminis-expanded-context-window-as-useful-as-we-thought">significantly larger context window</a> and monthly code completions cap.</p><p>Gemini Code Assist is now powered by an unspecified <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0 model</a> catered to coding-related tasks. It works with "all programming languages in the public domain," according to Google Cloud, and supports multiple integrated development environments (IDEs).</p><p>The free version is capped at 180,000 code completions per month, which is a lot more than other free code assistants. Additionally, the chat portion of Gemini Code Assist offers up to 128,000 tokens. "This large context window lets developers use large files and ground Gemini Code Assist with a broader understanding of their local codebases," the company explains in a blog post.</p><p>While there are still more powerful, paid versions of Gemini Code Assist available for people with greater needs, the free version is intended to make AI code help available for people on a budget. That could be students, indie developers, or anyone else with a project that could use code assistance. The free service is now compatible with Visual Studio Code, GitHub, or JetBrains, joining the existing support for Google-owned IDEs like Firebase and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/installing-android-sdk-windows-mac-and-linux-tutorial">Android Studio</a>.</p><p>Google says that support for various IDEs will help developers "more conveniently learn, create code snippets, debug and modify their existing applications — all without needing to toggle between different windows for help or to copy and paste information from disconnected sources."</p><p>GitHub integration for Gemini Code Assist is also entering public preview starting today, which is intended to make code reviews more painless for developers. You can learn more about the preview <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://github.com/apps/gemini-code-assist" target="_blank">here</a>, and provide feedback to help build Gemini Code Assist.</p>

That means the Secure Folder’s defenses are pretty much busted, except when accessed from personal profiles. This puts sensitive data at risk, especially if someone with admin access—like an employer’s IT team—digs into the work profile.</p><p>According to Android Authority, the issue boils down to how Secure Folder is built on Android’s Work Profile feature, which was initially meant for corporate setups. This setup creates a major gap between what Secure Folder is supposed to be—a private, encrypted vault—and how it actually works, which is more like a regular work profile. Because of this, apps in the work profile can use Android’s photo picker to access your “secured” photos and videos, completely dodging the lock you thought was keeping them safe.</p><p>On the other hand, Secure Folder isn’t the same as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>’s Private Space. Google built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">Private Space</a> to function as a totally independent user profile, creating a stronger barrier between your private data and the rest of your device.</p>

<p>After thorough testing, Mishaal Rahman from Android Authority confirmed the flaw, showing that media files in Secure Folder were exposed. However, other file types stayed protected thanks to Android’s file picker restrictions.</p><p>While some files stay protected, there’s another sneaky issue that lets hidden apps in the Secure Folder be exposed. If someone digs into the system’s settings and checks the Permission Manager, they can see a list of apps that have requested permissions—including the ones you thought were safely tucked away in the Secure Folder.</p><p>Samsung has apparently acknowledged the security flaws, but the company has not shared any concrete plans for a fix yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is reportedly testing a transparent nav bar for Circle to Search, ditching the solid color block for a cleaner, more modern feel.</li><li>Three-button users will notice the change more, while gesture users get a subtler upgrade.</li><li>A new “Are these results helpful?” prompt may appear in fullscreen searches, letting users give quick feedback.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is apparently testing out a fresh look for Circle to Search, and it’s about time. The update feels like a much-needed polish to make the feature a bit more modern and user-friendly.</p><p>A Reddit post that has since been pulled gave us a sneak peek at a test version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> rocking a transparent navigation bar, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/22/circle-to-search-transparent-nav-bar/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Right now, the feature uses a solid color block that covers up the bottom navigation, so this new look would be a pretty noticeable shift.</p><p>This tweak to the nav bar is more noticeable for folks still using the classic three-button setup. For gesture navigation users, the change is more subtle, but it still gives the whole interface a cleaner feel.</p><p>If this makes it to a final release, it will free up that part of the screen, giving the whole page a polished look.</p><p>Alongside the updated nav bar, Google may be working on a floating bar that sticks around at the bottom of the screen, asking, “Are these results helpful?” It pops up when search results go full-screen, giving you an easy way to weigh in on how useful they are.</p>

<p>As per 9to5Google, this little feature is basically borrowed from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-lens">Google Lens</a> search experience, so it should feel pretty familiar to anyone who’s used that before.</p><p>Users can quickly share their thoughts on search results by tapping “Yes,” “No,” or “Close,” mirroring the user-friendly setup already in place with Lens.</p><p>Both changes are apparently part of the Google app beta, version 16.6, but there’s a chance they could also be rolling out server-side. So, even if you’re not on the beta, you might still see these updates pop up.</p><p>Google has been all in on boosting Circle to Search this year, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-overviews-expands-galaxy-s25">addition of those upgraded AI Overviews</a>. The search giant is clearly working hard to keep improving the feature.</p>

<p>On paper, the brand-new OnePlus Watch 3 seems fit for competition with the Google Pixel Watch 3. They're both Wear OS watches with a focus on health and fitness sold at around $350. However, these two smartwatches take completely different approaches to making a Wear OS wearable. The OnePlus Watch 3 is big and bulky with a ton of battery life, whereas the Pixel Watch 3 is slim and stylish, with a dainty 41mm option and a bigger 45mm option.</p><p>So, which one is right for you? It's going to come down to whether you like a giant watch on your wrist or if you'd rather keep a lower profile. It also depends on which features you prioritize since they're not equal. Here's the full breakdown of how the OnePlus Watch 3 stacks up against the Pixel Watch 3.</p>

<p>The design and build of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> and Pixel Watch 3 immediately set the two wearables apart. The OnePlus Watch 3 looks similarly to its predecessor, with the notable exception that the crown actually rotates this time. It's available in Titanium Obsidian or Emerald stainless steel chassis, and retails for $330. The OnePlus Watch 3 only comes in one size, 46.6mm, and it's larger than both sizes of the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, you get a circular, pebble-shaped smartwatch with a minimalist design language. It's available in two sizes, 41mm and 45mm, starting at a price point of $350. For the larger screen or LTE connectivity, you'll have to pay more. This smartwatch is made with either matte or polished aluminum, and there are more color options available.</p><p>That's a key differentiator between the OnePlus Watch 3 and the Pixel Watch 3. The former includes a larger display and battery, but that comes at the expense of size. Meanwhile, you have more choice with the Pixel Watch 3, but get less battery life.</p>

<p>Aside from size, the OnePlus Watch 3 is also more rugged than the Pixel Watch 3. OnePlus certified its smartwatch for  MIL-STD-810H, a grueling military-grade standard, and uses sapphire-crystal glass. Google used Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the Pixel Watch 3's display by comparison. Both watches are water and dust-resistant, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">certified up to IP68</a> and 5ATM.</p>

<p>Of course, the display sizes of the Pixel Watch 3 and OnePlus Watch 3 will vary, but both watches use similar display technology. They're both equipped with LTPO AMOLED displays with high brightness capabilities. The OnePlus Watch 3 supports up to 2,200 nits of peak brightness, while the Pixel Watch 3 supports up to 2,000 nits.</p><p>Let's put the size and weight of each watch into perspective. The OnePlus Watch 3 measures 46.6 x 47.6 x 11.75mm and weighs 49.7 grams, whereas the similarly-sized (45mm) Pixel Watch measures 45 x 45 x 12.3 mm and weighs 37 grams. That's a sizable difference, and the smaller Pixel Watch 3 (41mm) measures just 41 x 41 x 12.3 mm, weighing only 31 grams.</p><p>Finally, the OnePlus Watch 3 uses standard 22mm watch bands, whereas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-watch-3-bands">the Pixel Watch 3 uses a proprietary system</a>.</p>

<p>Both the OnePlus Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 3 are powered by Wear OS 5, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-tips-and-tricks">each have their own tricks</a>. OnePlus uses a combination of Wear OS and its own RTOS, which helps it provide multi-day battery life. It can last for up to five days in smartwatch mode, and even longer in battery-saver mode. The Pixel Watch 3 relies on the Pixel-ified version of Wear OS, and can last up to a full day on a single charge. Sometimes you'll get more than that, though.</p><p>In terms of processors, both watches use Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 wearable system-on-a-chip</a>, which is the best you'll find. Both also have 32GB of onboard storage. The similarities continue for charging, as both watches use proprietary pucks or cradles to power up. OnePlus has a slight advantage here, as its cable and cradle are separate, so you can use any USB-C cable you'd like with the cradle.</p>

<p>The Pixel Watch 3 has the advantage in terms of connectivity. It supports the optional LTE add-on, and also supports NFC, ultra-wideband (UWB), and Bluetooth 5.3. By comparison, the OnePlus Watch 3 supports Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and Wi-Fi, but lacks an LTE option.</p>

<p>OnePlus has come a long way with fitness and health tracking. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> wasn't very consistent, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> was a step in the right direction. Now, the OnePlus Watch 3 continues the progress, and it might be better than the Pixel Watch 3 in some areas.</p><p>Both watches are loaded with health sensors. The OnePlus Watch 3 includes a wrist temperature sensor, optical heart rate sensor, and optical pulse oximeter sensor. That enables sleep monitoring, heart-rate monitoring, blood-oxygen sensing, and temperature monitoring. Notably, it doesn't have electrocardiogram (ECG) support.</p><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 uses the OHealth companion app for health and fitness tracking, whereas the Pixel Watch 3 uses a combination of apps, including the Pixel Watch app, Fitbit app, and others.</p>

<p>Smartwatches are more personal than, say, smartphones — choosing one over the other won't come down to which has better specs. There are a lot of other intangibles, and it's best to approach this comparison with a process of elimination depending on what you value. If you need ECG support, for example, you <em>have</em> to get the Pixel Watch 3, and the same goes for LTE support. Meanwhile, if you need multi-day battery life, you <em>have</em> to get the OnePlus Watch 3.</p><p>There's also the size consideration. If you like a smaller watch or have a tiny wrist, the 41mm size of the Pixel Watch 3 might be a better option. For those who want a giant, durable smartwatch, the nearly-47mm OnePlus Watch 3 is there. Aside from the nitty gritty details, it's clear that both the OnePlus Watch 3 and Pixel Watch 3 are two of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> you can buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>With MWC 2025 around the corner, Honor has given us an early look at its AI-powered upgrades before the full Alpha Plan reveal.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-alpha-plan-mwc-2025-tease">introducing the Alpha Plan last week</a>, Honor is now sharing more details about its vision. The company sees its AI-driven strategy as a game-changer for cross-platform compatibility, aiming to make iOS devices work more seamlessly within its ecosystem.</p><p>This technology beefs up Honor’s push for an open, intelligent, and seamlessly connected AI-driven future.</p><p>That’s pretty much all Honor has shared for now. Unfortunately, the company is keeping the juicy details about the new cross-device feature under wraps.</p><p>Honor’s earlier hints suggest the Alpha Plan revolves around building an open, collaborative AI ecosystem through global partnerships. This could mean potential integrations with major large language models like Gemini.</p><p>While Honor has already brought Gemini into its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>, its use of the DeepSeek LLM in the YOYO assistant shows a broader, multi-layered AI strategy. This makes the future of the Alpha Plan pretty flexible and open-ended.</p><p>Honor has set March 2 for the big reveal, with the press event kicking off at 16:30 CET, 15:30 BST, 10:30 EST, and 07:30 PST.</p>

<ul><li>Google is beginning to offer one-time payment options for Preferred Care plans.</li><li>These plans were previously only available for Fitbit products, but can now be purchased for new orders of Pixel phones, tablets, and watches.</li><li>The one-time fee nets buyers Preferred Care coverage for two years at a discount compared to the subscription cost.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google">Google</a> is changing its insurance partner for Preferred Care plans as of today, Feb. 24, and is adding a new payment option as part of the move. The company updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/store/answer/7528518" target="_blank">official support page</a> with the new insurance provider, as well as the one-time payment option that covers a Pixel phone, tablet, or watch for two years (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-two-year-warranty-3529155/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Previously, all Pixel devices had to be protected with Preferred Care via a subscription.</p><p>Google's Preferred Care plans are a means of insuring a Pixel or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">Fitbit device</a>, just like AppleCare Plus or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-samsung-care">Samsung Care</a>. Starting today, there are two different ways of purchasing a Preferred Care plan. You can either insure the device for two years with a one-time payment, or choose a monthly subscription for up to 60 months of total coverage.  In the event your screen is cracked, you'll pay $29 for a repair or up to $129 for a replacement.</p><p>The new offering coincides with a notice that Google changed its insurance provider for Preferred Care: "If your device is shipped on or after February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Asurion Warranty Protection Services, LLC, or one of its affiliates," the company explains in the support document. "If your device is shipped prior to February 24, 2025, your Service Contract Provider will be Assurant."</p><p>The only apparent consumer-facing change as part of the switch is the addition of the one-time payment option. Like the monthly plan, you can either add a plan during checkout at the Google Store or within 30 days of your purchase.</p><p>The prices for the two-year Preferred Care plans are as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Google Pixel 9: $159</li><li>Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL: $249</li><li>Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: $279</li><li>Google Pixel Fold: $279</li><li>Google Pixel 8 Pro: $249</li><li>Google Pixel 8: $159</li><li>Google Pixel 8a: $109</li><li>Google Pixel 7a: $99</li><li>Google Pixel 7 Pro: $199</li><li>Google Pixel 7: $149</li><li>Google Pixel Tablet: $99</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 3: $89</li><li>Google Pixel Watch 2: $89</li></ul>
<p>The above prices offer buyers a slight discount on Preferred Care compared to the cost of subscribing monthly for two years. Of course, the downside is that you can't insure your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Pixel device </a>with Preferred Care beyond 24 months if you use the upfront option.</p>

<ul><li>Nothing released a YouTube video explaining the design process for the Phone 3a series, including the big camera bump.</li><li>The move comes just after key official videos of the Phone 3a series were leaked — some of the same shots from the leak are in this 10-minute video.</li><li>Nothing also shared a teaser on X showcasing the smartphones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing's official reveal of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-renders-leak">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> is nearing, with a date set for March 4. However, the design of the two midrange smartphones leaked in its entirety over the weekend, leaving little to the imagination. The company followed that up with multiple teasers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1894007732044259657" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1ieD5Vwj8A">YouTube</a> today, Feb. 24, that provide further insight into the design of these phones.</p><p>The full-length video posted to Nothing's YouTube channel lasts more than 10 minutes and shows off the design of the Nothing Phone 3a series. While not specified, the device discussed and showcased appears to be the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, based on recent rumors and leaks. It has a large, circular, and centered camera bump with three rear camera sensors and a flash.</p><p>In an earlier teaser, Nothing revealed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-to-offer-50mp-periscope-lens-with-3x-optical-zoom">two of those three rear camera sensors use 50MP lenses</a>. There's a 50MP main camera, a 50MP periscope telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom, and an 8MP ultrawide camera.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Meet Phone (3a) Series.

<p>Nothing says it experimented with multiple versions of the Phone 3a design, starting with a camera housing similar to that of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>. Later, the phone's design evolved with the camera housing shown off today. There's also a chance that some of the designs showcased in the video influenced the Nothing Phone 3a, which hasn't been shown off yet.</p>

<p>From the video, it looks like the Phone 3a Pro's camera bump is quite large. You can't really pick up on it from the back, but it's evident from the side, as you can see in the still image taken from the official Nothing video. Around the gargantuan camera housing, there are three light strips that make up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-first-impressions">Glyph Interface</a>.</p>

<p>You can watch the full video above to learn more about the Nothing Phone 3a series. In typical Nothing fashion, the company is tricking out information about its upcoming devices ahead of their March 4 unveiling.</p>

<p>Leaks of the upcoming Motorola Razr Plus 2025 keep coming in, one more revealing than the next. This time, we got to see the device in a whole new colorway, thanks to tipster Evan Blass.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1893303427658141936" target="_blank">Taking to X, </a>Blass posted multiple images of the alleged Motorola Razr Plus 2025, also called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra. We get to see the phone in a new hue, dubbed 'Rio Red.' These images didn't just show off the red colorway but also gave us images from multiple angles of what we could expect from the hardware aspect of the device.</p><p>From its looks, the new red Razr will also get a faux leather back, similar to the dark green colorway that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/a-major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-just-revealed-its-sleek-new-look" target="_blank">leaked</a> earlier this month. There also appears to be a new button on one side, which could be similar to the Quick Button found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2024-review">Motorola Edge 2024</a>.</p>

<p>So far, from all the leaks collectively we see that this year's edition will look a lot like last year's phone, however in a more polished look with the leather back. But when it comes to specific design changes, previous leaks have hinted that the right edge houses the volume buttons and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner similar to the above images. At the bottom, we see a SIM slot, mic, USB-C port, and speaker next to each other.</p><p>On the display front, the device will supposedly stick with its 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch OLED cover screen like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>. And like any new or upcoming phone on the market, the Moto Razr Plus 2025 could be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, with the seven-core version specifically made for foldables.</p><p>On the camera front, the images indicate that it'll have a dual camera array. While we don't know much about the exact specs of the lens, we assume it could be a combination of a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens, like its predecessor.</p><p>Other than that, the clamshell is rumored to get a 4,000mAh battery that will maintain support for 45W wired and 15W wireless charging speeds like its predecessor, which remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> on the market.</p>

<ul><li>A Korean news website recently stated that Samsung Electronics is expected to release a 'double-folding' phone along with the upcoming Galaxy Z series.</li><li>Several industry sources claim that the phone will be sent in for mass production by the end of April.</li><li>Samsung is set to produce 200,000 units of the 'G Fold,' which will allegedly be launched as a small batch to gauge how this will be received.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250224000261" target="_blank">Korean news site</a>, Samsung is planning to launch its rumored multi-fold phone, reportedly dubbed the "Galaxy G Fold," along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 later this year. The site claims that the company is ready to send these devices in for mass production as early as April.</p><p>Looks like several internal sources told the ETNews that "The double-folding multi-fold phone is being developed and produced simultaneously with the Z series" and that it will be released at the same time.</p><p>Additionally, since this is the first multi-fold phone by the company, there seems to be chatter that it will only produce around 200,000 units at first to see how the public will receive this phone. “As this is a form factor that is being introduced [by Samsung] for the first time, only a small quantity will be produced in some countries, just like when the Fold SE was released last year,” an industry insider told ETNews.</p><p>What we have known about the phone up until now is that it will feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>Another important detail that came out of this leak is that this phone may not come with an S Pen. This is likely due to the lack of a digitizer, a magnetic field that allows for a pen-like accessory to interact with the screen.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-double-folding-device-production-details-rumored" target="_blank">rumor surfaced in January</a> that stated the phone could have a "G-shaped fold style" with an inward folding mechanism. This could mean that the phone will fold the screen inward twice, which could be built off of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://global.samsungdisplay.com/29253/">Flex G screen prototype</a> that surfaced at the CES back in 2022.</p><p>Other specs of this foldable are still unknown. However, if it's impending launch later this July, we could hopefully expect to see some leaks soon.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus (2023)</a> may be getting on in years, but it's still an impressive flagship phone with a stunning 165Hz pOLED display, two-day battery, and the efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset. You even get 512GB of storage!</p>
<p>I certainly wouldn't buy it at full price, but thanks to this 43% discount at Amazon, the Edge Plus (2023) has suddenly become one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap Android phones</a> on the market. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2W7YYHM" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ed360a7a-80cb-4975-a64e-ff2feab50541" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$699.99" data-dimension48="$699.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want an unlocked smartphone with a gorgeous display, over two days of battery life, and solid performance for under $400; you don&apos;t mind using a last-gen device. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a phone with all of the latest features; you take lots of pictures or videos with your smartphone; you can afford a newer device. </p>
<h2 id="is-the-motorola-edge-plus-2023-still-worth-it-2">Is the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) still worth it?</h2>
<p>Despite its age, the Edge Plus (2023) remains one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phones</a> on the market, and this new discount only makes the phone more agreeable for folks who have been on the fence. The 165Hz display is still fantastic to look at, and the two-day battery can easily match the best modern devices from Samsung or Google.</p><p>Sure, if you&apos;re accustomed to using something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra or the Pixel 9 Pro, you&apos;ll probably notice that the Edge Plus&apos; Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset isn&apos;t as fast as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around, but it could easily hold its own against a midrange device like the Google Pixel 8a. Motorola&apos;s software promise also guarantees that the Edge Plus (2023) will receive OS updates through Android 15, so you don&apos;t need to worry about the phone feeling obsolete any time soon.</p><p>If money is no object and you want all of the latest technology and AI features, then the Motorola Edge Plus (2023) isn&apos;t the phone for you. But if you simply want a reliable, stylish device with great performance and battery life for under $500, then you simply can&apos;t beat this Motorola discount.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-107">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google confirmed today (Feb 24) that it will soon fade out its SMS code sign-in method for Gmail in favor of QR codes.</li><li>The company says QR codes will offer a little more robust security as SMS codes are more prone to "phishing."</li><li>Google reiterated the same sentiment during its first introduction of passkeys for personal accounts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Today (Feb 24), Google states it is moving to remove SMS security codes for Gmail in replace of something a little stronger.</p><p>A statement via a Gmail spokesperson to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2025/02/23/google-confirms-gmail-to-ditch-sms-code-authentication/">Forbes</a> reads, "...we want to move away from sending SMS messages for authentication." As a result, Google is now interested in displaying a QR code for users attempting to securely sign in to their Gmail accounts. Spokesperson Ross Richendrfer informed the publication that this will begin "over the next few months."</p><p>QR code sign-in will be a part of Google's new vision for "verifying phone numbers." While users will need to scan the code with their phone's camera, the company states this new security method will assist users in two ways.</p><p>First, Google says a QR code will help reduce the risk of phishing as users won't be "tricked into sharing their security codes with a threat actor." The company adds QR codes will also reduce the "reliance" users have on their "phone carrier for anti-abuse protections."</p><p>This second point was highlighted by Richendrfer and Google's Kimberly Samra, who state SMS with a security code isn't all that safe. They add that, with SMS codes, users run the risk of a malicious person gaining a hold of their phone number. If that's done, all "security value of SMS goes away." Google says SMS codes are at the "heart" of many criminal operations around the world, forcing this issue (in its eyes) even more.</p><p>Aside from "over the next few months," Google didn't tell Forbes when users can see this change rollout. However, there will likely be more obvious statements/announcements from Google when it happens. The company teased more will happen "in the near future."</p>

<p>Google's been kicking its security strength up a notch ever since it made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-account-passkey-access-by-default">passkeys the default option</a> for personal accounts. The company touted passkeys were 40% faster than passwords and were developed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-fido-passwordless-security">FIDO Alliance</a>. More importantly, passkeys rely solely on your device's various authentication methods like fingerprint, face ID, or PIN. Like what it's trying to do with the SMS, QR code swap, Google says passkeys can't be phished or stolen.</p><p>In short, your credentials won't be stolen over an internet connection.</p><p>Google rolled out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-tools-for-cybersecurity-awareness-month">few more enhanced security features</a> for users a few months before passkeys, involving a Dark Web report. The feature arrived for Gmail and let users lean on it to see if their email addresses had been leaked/exposed on the dark web.</p>

<hr>
<p>Microsoft is reportedly beginning to test an experimental search results mode for users backed by its AI software.</p><p>In a statement, Microsoft confirmed the start of this "AI-powered search mode" to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/02/24/exclusive-microsoft-bing-tests-ai-search-that-replaces-blue-links-like-google-ai-mode/">Windows Latest</a>; however, the company declined to explain further (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/microsoft-bing-copilot-search-google-ai-mode/">9to5Google</a>). The publication turned to an unnamed source, which provided more insight into how Bing's "AI Search" could work once it's rolled out.</p><p>A key aspect of this mode is the engine will leverage Microsoft's Copilot software for a view that's loaded with all the information a user could want for a subject.</p><p>The publication states <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-default-assistant-beta-rollout">Copilot</a> will "summarize" everything about the user's question without the user needing to scour the web. When receiving answers, AI Search will provide a brief explainer before diving into organized pieces of information. The post states when asking about the safety of "Windows 11 24H2," AI Search broke things down by "update safety, risks, and compatibility checks."</p><p>Bing's AI Search view will supposedly be clean, offering only your question with the AI and the results that follow. Early tests show the right side will offer tabs for "Images" and "Video," while the UI's bottom gives you suggested (relevant) follow-up questions and the ability to write one yourself.</p><p>The publication's source highlights another key aspect of "AI Search:" the removal of all website links. Supposedly, the Copilot AI will do all of the heavy lifting, sourcing information for users and displaying it in a digestible format.</p><p>Moreover, Copilot will cite <em>where </em>it got its information at the end of its summary. Users can click on them for fact-checking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-global-language-support-expansion">similar to what Google's done</a> with AI Overviews.</p>

<p>The biggest thing about Microsoft's confirmed "AI Search" development is that it mirrors what Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-mode-gemini-backed-search-reported">is reportedly creating for Search</a>. Earlier this month, a report surfaced stating Google was working on an "AI Mode" for Search, which mirrors a typical conversation with Gemini. This "alternate" mode will supposedly offer organized answers with defined headers for "complex questions."</p><p>Users can swap to this mode, likely in the same manner as you would switch to see image results or news.</p><p>The rumored example of Google's AI Mode is reminiscent of what we've seen rumored for Microsoft Bing. The page will be void of site links, only offering the information discovered/summarized by a "custom" version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini 2.0</a> model.</p><p>Regarding Microsoft, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/microsoft-copilot-play-store-launch">launched Copilot</a> in January 2024 with OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALLE-3 models as its backbone. It's also worth noting Microsoft nabbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-deepmind-co-founder-joins-microsoft">Google's DeepMind co-founder</a> last year to further its new journey into AI. Mustafa Suleyman was brought on to oversee everything dealing with Microsoft AI, meaning what's coming up via "AI Search" could be the fruit of their hard work.</p>

<p><em><strong>Milo asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why are smartphones not getting better? It seems like we have so many places to get better, but all phones are essentially the same now.</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Milo, and thanks for asking! This is a polarizing issue, but I can see where you're going — almost every phone is a rectangular sandwich of glass running software that does the same things as other phones. It seems like they all came from a clone factory.</p><p>On the other hand, a lot of people are going to disagree. This is because some phones are outliers, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> or phones with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-samsung-ditch-the-s-pen-in-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">S Pen</a>, and the small software features can make a big difference for the people who use them regularly.</p><p>Still, if you put 100 new phones in a box, most of them are just like the others, so I get it.</p>

<p>There are reasons for this, of course. A phone maker has two goals when it offers a new product — it wants it to be popular and sell in the millions, and it wants to make a bit of profit from every unit sold. To do this, they have to offer what they're sure people want to buy.</p><p>If you look at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9</a>, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13,</a> or any other "normal" smartphone, you can see they seem alike, especially at a glance. However, the small differences add up and are what makes people choose one over the other.</p><p>If you want to take amazing photos without fiddling with anything, buy a Pixel 9. If you want to do the same for video, buy an iPhone 16. Want the ultimate set of specs and hardware for a good price? The OnePlus 13 is for you. And, of course, the Galaxy S25 further refines the software people love with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI</a>. There are differences even though they seem the same at a glance.</p>

<p>But there are other phones out there, especially on the Android side. It's hard to say the industry is stagnant when you can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally">a phone that folds out three ways</a>, a phone that flips open like a Star Trek Communicator, or a phone that silos an integrated smart stylus. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-2-reveal">Techno Phantom Ultimate 2</a> (these names are getting terrible) or a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a> (see?) aren't anything like a Pixel or an iPhone. Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> and its S Pen are very different from the base model S25 or any slab phone.</p><p>I think phone makers <em>are</em> innovating but in a different way than they used to. We see fewer gimmicks like an IR blaster or a tiny ticker screen and more focus on the things that seem to sell. You and I might have loved the IR blaster or the LG V10's small ticker tape screen, but they didn't add to the overall sales numbers in a way that justifies their inclusion. And that's the real deciding factor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a5HLcCVC7Cf8Z9y3pKP53g" name="lg-v10-second-screen-in-hand.jpg" alt="LG V10 Second Screen settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5HLcCVC7Cf8Z9y3pKP53g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Phone makers are also working on ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">make their phones thinner</a> and batteries that last longer. These aren't flashy innovations that stand out from the pack, but they're something that people demand. Remember, making a thin device even thinner or packing a bigger battery in a tighter space isn't easy.</p><p>We all won't appreciate the design and hardware innovation in the smartphone world of the past few years. I want a thicker phone with a big <em>removable</em> battery, made of quality plastic with enough bezel to hold it without my big, thick thumbs hitting the screen. Better yet, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/blackberry-key2-second-opinion">BlackBerry</a> could rise from the ashes and build me what I loved to use.</p><p>None of this is happening because what I want isn't as important as what most people want. I think phone makers are delivering what people want, and these small differences make a world of difference when it comes to using your phone.</p><p>Eventually, some company will fire off something nerdy, goofy, and weird that enthusiasts love. If it sells, then the other companies will copy it. Until then, we'll see the small differences and minor revisions between models to make them consumer-friendly.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster claims to have revealed the renderings for the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 and a few of its changes.</li><li>The foldable is supposedly slimming down as Samsung removes its S Pen digitizer while also sporting a larger 8.2-inch internal display and 6.5-inch cover.</li><li>A recent South Korea report suggested Samsung was moving away from the digitizer to shave roughly 0.6mm off the device's thickness.</li><li>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to debut later this summer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Starting the week is a pack of alleged renderings depicting Samsung's upcoming book-style foldable.</p><p>The leaks were surfaced by X tipster OnLeaks in conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Android Headlines</a> who've compiled a list of its supposed specifications. According to the tipster, the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature a "larger" 8.2-inch internal and 6.5-inch external display. Additionally, early rumors claim there's a slight dimension change, which could mean the "front screen" is "even wider" than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">its predecessor</a>.</p><p>Overall, the leaked renders show a Galaxy Z Fold 7 that looks pretty identical to the Fold 6. The cover display boasts relatively thin bezels while its internal display offers even slimmer borders.</p><p>The back of the device is rumored to receive an upgrade as the tipster claims the primary lens will arrive at 200MP. Rumors add it could be joined by a 12MP ultrawide lens and a 10MP telephoto with a 10MP selfie camera. The internal display is supposedly receiving a 4MP UDC (under-display camera).</p><p>The leaked renders don't indicate much change for the rear panel. The triple camera array remains as a vertical, pill-shaped housing for the three lenses. That housing also provides a small bump, as the post claims the device rises to 9.5mm when factoring in the camera array.</p><p>Without it, the device is 9mm in thickness when folded; however, the tipster states the phone is only 4.5mm when unfolded. Curiously, the renderings don't show a slot for the Fold 7's S Pen.</p>

<p>Other specification rumors state the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and a 4,400mAh battery. The device is expected to launch later this summer, perhaps in "mid-July," per the recent leak.</p><p>There are some specifications here that have remained consistent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-design-s-pen-digitizer-south-korean-rumors">following a South Korea report</a> on Samsung's planned changes. It was stated earlier this month that the Korean OEM was considering a display increase for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, potentially pushing its internal screen to 8 inches while its cover display could see a 6.5-inch change. More importantly, creating a slimmer book-style device was also a key aspect.</p><p>The company has played with the removal of its S Pen digitizer, meaning consumers could no longer store/charge the stylus within the device. It was rumored that this would shave off roughly 0.6mm. As previously mentioned, the current renderings don't show an S Pen slot, so this <em>might </em>be the way the next Fold will go.</p><p>As a result, Samsung could make the S Pen a little bulkier and with a series of "improved" functions.</p><p>A chunkier S Pen was reiterated today (Feb 24) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/looks-like-the-galaxy-z-fold-7s-fan-favorite-feature-is-here-to-stay">in a separate leak</a> that claimed Samsung is working on an upgraded stylus with a revamped tip for better writing. It was speculated that this newer version may only work with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p>

<hr>
<p>Oppo just unveiled its latest creation, the Find N5, which is the slimmest foldable phone they’ve ever made, and for the global markets. However, it seems like Oppo might not be expanding its release to other countries like Europe.</p><p>The company has confirmed in a statement given to a YouTuber, The Tech Chap (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/22/oppo-find-n5-europe-global-launch/">9to5Google</a>), alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.computerbase.de/news/smartphones/faltbares-smartphone-das-oppo-find-n5-kommt-nicht-nach-europa.91488/">ComputerBase</a> publication indicating that it isn’t bringing its thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, to Europe. It also means the device is highly unlikely to be available in Germany as well.</p><p>Here’s the statement given by Oppo:</p>
<p>“At OPPO, we carefully tailor our product launchers to each region based on in-depth market research and strategic priorities. The Find N5 will not be launching in Europe. Instead, in Q1 2025, we will introduce the Reno13 series across Europe on February 24, offering consumers more choices with cutting-edge AI features and stylish, trend-forward designs. Stay tuned for updates.”</p>

<p>The latest update should be quite disappointing for consumers across Europe and the U.K. region as the Find N5 has been one of the most anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> the tech industry has witnessed recently. Oppo’s sibling OnePlus has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-not-launching-the-open-2-is-a-massive-win-for-samsung">recently announced</a> that it isn’t bringing any foldable this year, closing the gates of the OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>It has also been the highly anticipated device, and ever since the Find N5 surfaced on the web, rumors were floating around that it could be dubbed the OnePlus Open 2 in global markets including Europe, the U.K., and the U.S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to predecessor" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QH2Pc5qGSmJ2kLAKXZ9ix4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Oppo Find N5 made its debut on February 20 in Singapore, marking a global launch. Even in the accompanying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oppo.com/en/newsroom/press/find-n5-global-launch/">press release</a>, the company noted that the Find N5 “marks a new phase in Oppo’s global expansion.” On the contrary, the device is skipping markets like the U.K., the U.S., and Europe.</p><p>Other than the availability aspect of the Find N5, the foldable phone turned out to be a great handset, making the competition sweat. The device’s ultra-thin design, ability to easily hold and use, and no visible crease, alongside a great display, battery, and IPX9 ingress protection, happen to be the key takeaways of the Find N5, which is about to go on sale in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>The Pixel 9a is expected to arrive next month. Despite many leaks, hands-on photos, specifications leaks, and so on, the latest one is out of the box.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a> was surprisingly showcased in a recent Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge leak video. The video, which has now been deleted —showcased the alleged Galaxy S25 Edge camera samples in which the Pixel 9a was supposedly lying around a table.</p>

<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/22/pixel-9a-real-world-leak/">9to5Google</a> points out, the Pixel 9a was spotted for only a few seconds in, and according to the publication's screenshots,  it certainly appears to be Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range handset</a> featuring a pill-shaped dual camera visor flushed into the rear panel — as we've known from previous leaks. This means Google is letting go of its usual Pixels’ popular raised camera visor. The search giant’s “G” logo was also visible on the back panel indicating the same design as we have seen in several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/massive-pixel-9a-leak-reveals-official-looking-renders-color-options">leaked renders</a> and hands-on images.</p>

<p>On the other hand, another leaked hands-on video (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/24/latest-pixel-9a-hands-on-leak-shows-a-very-cheap-looking-handset/">9to5Google</a>) of the Pixel 9a has emerged, giving us a closer look at the mid-range handset. Since the phone doesn't look much more attractive than its predecessors, the choice to use a pill-shaped camera visor instead of the raised camera bar design should either help or go the other way for the public when they choose to buy it.</p><p>The new visor is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-major-specs-render-design-changes-leaked">tipped</a> to include a 48MP primary lens, accompanying a 13MP ultra-wide lens. Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">expected specs</a> per the earlier leaks include a Tensor G4 SoC, a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, and HDR10 Plus support. We might be seeing 128GB and 256GB storage options, and a 5100mAh battery capacity powering the handset. The device is also tipped to start at $499.</p>

<hr>
<p>Turns out, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn’t <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">ditching the S Pen</a> after all, but it’s tipped to be getting a bit of a makeover. A new rumor suggests that Samsung is making the stylus thicker than the one on the Fold 6.</p><p>Leaker PandaFlash claimed in a post on X that a new version of the S Pen is in the works. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-7-s-pen-redesigned-rumor/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> points out that this doesn’t necessarily mean the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> will have the stylus built in, it does hint that a revamped S Pen could be on the way soon.</p>

<p>This rumor is pretty interesting because it goes against what we’ve heard before. Earlier rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-design-s-pen-digitizer-south-korean-rumors">suggested the S Pen might get scaled back on the Fold 7</a>, with Samsung possibly trimming down its features to make the phone itself thinner. It seemed like a classic design trade-off (slimmer device, less capable stylus). But now, it looks like that might not be the case after all.</p><p>On the flip side, new reports are hinting that Samsung is working on a revamped S Pen packed with more features. While the details are still under wraps, the stylus is said to be a bit thicker.</p><p>This change might also tie into rumors of a new stylus tip in the works, as mentioned by the same source.</p><p>If the tipster’s info is on point, the new S Pen might not work with older Galaxy Z Fold models. At the same time, there’s still some uncertainty about whether the stylus will lose any features.</p><p>Samsung is rumored to start S Pen production in June. If tradition holds, Samsung's next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> will make their debut at a Galaxy Unpacked event in July.</p><p>While the Galaxy Z Fold 7 might not completely reinvent the foldable wheel, it’s shaping up to bring some pretty tempting upgrades. Rumor has it we’ll see a sleeker hinge and a less noticeable screen crease, among others.</p><p>Even with all the upgrades, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 seems to be playing it safe, focusing more on fine-tuning than breaking new ground. Rumor has it that the phone will stick with reliable hardware, like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, instead of pushing for anything too radical.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung threw us a curveball by showing off the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate"> Galaxy S25 Edge </a>at the recent Unpacked event. However, people present there were not allowed to get too close to the phone, let alone get a hands-on of the device.</p><p>YouTuber <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8I6XJPnji3o" target="_blank">Alexis Garza</a> was lucky enough to take this new phone for a spin. In a now-deleted video, Garza shared a short tease of the alleged device, confirming the supposed specs of what we can expect from Samsung's upcoming slim phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/galaxy-s25-edge-youtube-video-3528938/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>The publication further adds that in the video, Garza seems to have placed the Galaxy S25 Edge next to the unfolded Galaxy Z Fold 6, which measures 5.6mm in thickness when unfolded. The S25 Edge visibly seems a tad thicker than the Z Fold 6, which means it could be just under 6mm.</p><p>Still measuring thinner than the Galaxy S25 lineup, the S25 Edge's specs were also shown in the video with the help of the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.finalwire.aida64&hl=en"> AIDA64 app</a>, which provides hardware and software information as well as diagnostic information for Android devices. The AIDA64 app says that the Galaxy S25 Edge will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, similar to the Galaxy S25 series, and will have 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First hands-on of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge!

<p>Other than that, it will allegedly support Bluetooth 5.4 and have a 4,000mAh battery, which is similar to the standard <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> model. The app spilled some details about the expected camera array of the device, revealing three 12MP cameras. Since we know that the phone will have two rear cameras, the third sensor could refer to the selfie camera.</p><p>According to Android Authority, the AIDA64 shows the resolution at which images are saved and doesn't take into account the sensor’s full resolution, so the phone could still feature a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs">200MP primary camera</a>, as rumored, and a 50MP ultrawide.</p><p>While we can't fully corroborate all the details in the video since it was taken down, we could piece together what to expect out of Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge. Regardless, we anticipate knowing more about the phone closer to the device's official release, which is expected later this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>You probably didn't use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-appstore-good-and-bad">Amazon's Android Appstore</a> because very few people do. Outside of Kindle and FireTV devices, the Amazon Appstore is simply an afterthought; one that isn't as good as what you already have installed from Google. That's surely a big reason why the company is dropping the stand-alone version for "regular" Android devices. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-will-suspend-support-for-its-appstore-on-android">Come August 20, it's gone</a>. I wish it weren't.</p><p>Not because I think you get a better experience from Amazon than you do from Google or because I can't find what I want on the Play Store. I hate to see it happen because it's a giant tech company with seemingly infinite resources that <em>isn't</em> Google.</p>
<p>Normally, I would say one faceless tech super-corporation is the same as any other. That's still true; these companies prosper and seem to have no regard for what is best for consumers. This is a special case, though, because Google is in a special position when it comes to the smartphone.</p><p>Google owns this space. You might look around and see so many people using an iPhone that this sounds silly, but close to eight of every 10 phones worldwide use Google's Android OS. Apple has a foothold in a few places, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheaper Android phones</a> are what powers most of the world.</p><p>I don't want to see any company in that unique position get stronger.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM" name="amazon-prime-box.jpg" alt="Amazon Prime Box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon )</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Amazon is equally as bad in many ways. It's a business designed to find ways to profit from us all and they're really good at it. If we were talking about commerce or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-ai-store-reviews-blurb-spotted">online shopping</a>, I would find the same reasons why Amazon should be reigned in. However, we are talking about smartphones and the Android platform in particular.</p><p>Amazon is one of the few companies that could have found a way to compete with Google. This wasn't one of the company's primary goals and the Amazon Appstore is in place to bolster Amazon's own Android-powered devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-you-should-buy-amazon-fire-hd-8-plus-instead-echo-show">Kindle Tablet</a>. If the company had wanted, it could have invested and tried things that would attract consumers to its storefront, stealing potential purchases and control away from Google.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead" target="_blank">alternative app markets</a> for Android, and some of them are very good; they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://f-droid.org/en/" target="_blank">more open and more secure,</a> and that's tough to pull off. None of these companies are in a position to make a difference in how Google exercises control. At least not the same way Amazon is. And control is 100% the meat of the issue.</p><p>Google is not your friend. I know sometimes it feels that way, and the informal language and friendly onboarding make Google seem like someone you would want to hang out with. It really isn't. As a U.S. corporation, it has only one purpose: to maximize profits for shareholders. This is because the law demands it do everything legal to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/shareholder-value-purpose-corporation" target="_blank">maximize the value of the corporation</a>. In other words, Android only exists to make Alphabet more valuable, and every decision reflects this.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.40%;"><img id="wyPkQmB8xRSNJyNDBwmnPo" name="Linux Distributions" alt="The top Linux distros of 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wyPkQmB8xRSNJyNDBwmnPo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1144" height="691" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also isn't nearly as open as the company likes to pretend. To use Android, you only have to download and build it. To use Android<sup>tm</sup> you have to follow a strict set of rules; yes, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines#:~:text=The%20%22Android%22%20name%2C%20the,the%20Android%20Open%20Source%20Project." target="_blank">Google has trademarked the Android name</a>.</p><p>That's not a bad thing. Without some sort of control, Android would turn into "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Linux_distributions" target="_blank">Linux on the desktop,</a>" where it seems disjointed, and each instance is different from the others. Imagine trying to use a phone where the manufacturer could do anything they wanted to do with the software.</p><p>There has to be some sort of balance. Google can not be allowed to do whatever it wants with no regard for the consumer or the competition. We've seen the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">governmental scrutiny</a> Google has come under quite a few times, but this usually only addresses the most grievous issues. We also need some healthy — and worthy — competition to keep Google in check.</p><p>And now we're going to have less of it.</p>

Never having owned the Casio GMW-B5000 that it's based on — or any Casio watch — the nostalgia factor never affected me. I never expected Casio to offer to send me one, nor did I expect to like it so much. But here we are!</p>

<p>The "Casio ring watch" isn't a traditional <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a>, which sets it up for easy ridicule. The stainless steel design is impressive, but all its heavy components are designed to tell the time and start/stop a stopwatch with tiny buttons, on a screen too small to read easily. It's not breaking new ground.</p><p>Compare that to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> that tracks heart rate, stress, workouts, sleep, and a dozen other metrics while weighing significantly less (16g vs. 3-5g). Putting it in the same conversation with a novelty mini-watch isn't really fair to Casio, especially since both smart rings cost $230 more, but it's a natural comparison to make as smart rings grow in popularity.</p>

<p>Now that I'm seeing Casio's ring in person — instead of looking at press photos that emphasize the display — I have to admit that it's cute, even without the nostalgia factor. It's about the size of a high school class ring, only less garish (apologies to everyone I just offended), and the ridged steel look draws the eye.</p><p>It only ships in one size, but it comes with a few translucent inserts to shrink it down; thankfully, it fits snugly on my right ring finger with one. It's on the noticeably heavy side, so I don't wear it while running. But Casio must have decided it was a necessary trade-off to get the steel, watch-like look and two-year battery life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="p7gPJ8Lu2cyN7hqFER3k3g" name="Casio-smart-ring-display" alt="A close-up of the Casio CRW001-1 ring watch's default time display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p7gPJ8Lu2cyN7hqFER3k3g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The grayscale screen only catches the eye at a direct visual angle; otherwise, it just looks like a flat, glossy layer above the metal, so it's not distracting. I assumed people would side-eye me for wearing a dorky mini-watch, but you don't notice that aesthetic unless you're quite close. Even then, the one or two comments I've received are more out of interest and curiosity than open derision.</p><p>My recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch fashion contest</a> proved that I don't really know what regular, non-techy people think is attractive in wearables; maybe people are silently judging my tastes. But this ring will certainly appeal to a niche crowd that loves the bulky Casio or Garmin Instinct look and already has heart rate tracking from another device.</p>

<p>Frankly, most smart rings besides Casio's look the same to me; their designs are in a race towards getting as skinny and low-key as possible, but they're all these 1-inch-wide metallic bands with a few gold or silver palette swaps. Even this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-rare-luxury-smart-ring-with-premium-materials-massive-price">$1,500 luxury smart ring</a> looks fairly generic, aside from the 18K gold or PT950 platinum materials.</p><p>I've also noticed how many smart rings are pushing to become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade devices</a>, with FDA-approved health sensors meant to target B2B sales and impress doctors instead of consumers. Basically, smart rings aren't <em>fun</em>; they're meant to be taken seriously and to blend in. Everything they give you is passive data that requires staring at your phone.</p><p>In that context, the budget-priced Casio "smart" ring feels like a nice change of pace. I don't need a stopwatch timer very often; a countdown timer would be more useful. But I certainly don't mind having a way to check the time whenever I get smartwatch fatigue and take mine off for the day. It does <em>one</em> gimmick; otherwise, it's just there to look pretty, not sell health subscriptions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="naMCo5feQuGV5VZduR7Kyf" name="Casio-smart-ring-stopwatch" alt="A close-up of the Casio CRW001-1 ring watch on the stopwatch setting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/naMCo5feQuGV5VZduR7Kyf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The stopwatch function on the Casio smart ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't think it's worth getting too philosophical about a 50th-anniversary, limited-time device that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casio.com/us/watches/casio/product.CRW-001-1/">already sold out</a> (though you can sign up for in-stock alerts at that link). We may not see anything like this again, and I'm sure most people would find it more dorky than cool. But I wouldn't mind if we started seeing more <em>limited</em> smart rings that emphasize unique designs over functionality.</p><p>Look at Circular Ring, the rare smart ring with a haptic motor for silent wake-ups, notification buzzes, and even subtle guidance for meditation. We liked the concept, but Circular had to ditch haptics in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Ring 2</a> to add an FDA-approved ECG, until they find a way to fit both. That might be the right business decision, but the need to offer competitive health and wellness data above all else makes the field more monotonous.</p><p>Everyone thinks of smart rings as mobile, 24/7 doctor's offices. But we should shake off that impulse to judge any rings that <em>don't</em> offer health tracking as useless. After all, many people think smart rings are pointless <em>because</em> their smartwatch already tracks the same things.</p><p>I don't know what these new, non-health smart rings would do, necessarily, besides this mini-stopwatch ring. Off the top of my head, we could see ones with phone-connected haptics for alarms and notifications, NFC-based contactless payments, UWB to unlock a specific digital car key or house smart lock, fall detection for seniors and the disabled, and so on.</p><p>Because they'll focus on one or two key things instead of offering every health sensor and the kitchen sink, maybe smart rings can be (A) more affordable and (B) more aesthetically distinct, like the Casio ring. And these niche models won't be in such strict competition with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>.</p>

The phone is about as thin as a standard unfolding smartphone but with much more display. In fact, when closed, the Find N5 feels no different than a regular phone yet still manages to fit plenty of flagship specs and features. It feels too good to be true, and yet it still sets a new standard for phones that I hope to see other OEMs strive for.</p><p>I’ve been using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a> for about a week now, and while I still prefer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> to large foldables, what OPPO has done here is something special. This phone is pretty much the full package; it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> with phenomenal performance, a pretty great set of Hasselblad cameras, impressive displays, and a battery that’s larger than the unit in the much thicker Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>That last part is especially important because OPPO is following Honor’s example by launching a very thin foldable, then <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-honor-magic-v3-packs-a-tiny-message-roasting-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold">calling out Samsung</a> for its embarrassingly thick phone. The company highlights that the thinness was partly a result of its battery technology that recently made its way to the OnePlus 13, sporting 10% silicon to produce a denser battery unit that doesn’t compromise on capacity or charging speed.</p><p>This is a big deal, one that spans not only candybar phones and the current batch of foldables flooding the market but could also have far-reaching effects on more niche form factors and other device categories.</p>

<p>OPPO and OnePlus have shown that with this new way of building batteries, there are essentially two ways they can go about implementing it. Clearly, the OPPO Find N5 took the "less is more" route by aiming for a very thin phone. This is important because we've seen that thin phones are set to make a comeback, and the more battery we can stuff into them, the better.</p><p>This has been a point of contention for some when it comes to upcoming devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. Even among Android Central staff, there seems to be a divide between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/3-reasons-id-instantly-buy-an-ultra-slim-phone-like-the-rumored-galaxy-s25-slim">those who want a thin phone </a>and those who are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-slim-if-its-real-who-asked-for-this">concerned about the sacrifices needed</a> to get there. I'm somewhat in the middle, leaning toward now wanting to deal with a battery that will only get me through half a day of use (I'm past the days of using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Razr Plus 2023</a>).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs">rumors of the Edge</a> also don't leave us with much confidence that Samsung has it figured out, although we still won't know much until the official launch, whenever that is.</p><p>Of course, Samsung isn't the only one shooting for thin. Apple is rumored to have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/iphone/iphone-17-air-renders-give-us-a-close-look-at-the-possible-design-of-apples-rumored-super-slim-model">very slim iPhone</a> set to launch this year, which gives credence to the return of the thin phone trend of years past. After all, Apple rarely does anything without a ton of market research and a solid plan, so either this is something that customers are yearning for, or it's something Apple <em>wants</em> them to want.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> went with the "more is more" route. Instead of aiming for thinness, the phone arrived with a battery that's 600mAh larger than its predecessor. That's no small feat, especially given that the phone is <em>still</em> thinner and lighter than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a>.</p><p>What this tells me is that companies may no longer have to choose between providing a svelte design or good battery life; you can have your cake and eat it, too. Of course, it may take a generation or two before other companies actually catch up. Batter tech is slow to evolve and catch on, and Samsung learned the hard way that rocking the boat in that department can lead to some explosive outcomes.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-bottom-view-alt.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 bottom view comaprison" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zJqhoAzS9Z47p72SjR3sSV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While this is a great way to mark the OPPO Find N5 as the thinnest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>, the implications go beyond OPPO and the devices we currently have on the market.</p><p>Multi-fold devices have begun cropping up, mostly as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">concept phones</a>, but with one commercially available device from Huawei hitting the global market. It's a magnificent feat of engineering, one that seems like overkill until you get one in your hands. You start to see the benefit of having a phone that could turn into a full-blown tablet... that is until you close the thing.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-reaction-is-a-tri-fold-phone-necessary">Huawei Mate XT</a> is nearly 13mm when folded, which admittedly feels pretty ridiculous, even compared to the 12.1mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. What's more is that Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">rumored to have a multi-fold phone</a> in the works, with the company showing off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-foldable-display-concepts-ces-2022">various concept devices</a> over the years. Unfortunately, given Samsung's track record with foldable design and the downward trend of its sales in the segment, I could see this being dead on arrival. No one wants a 14 or 15mm-thick phone protruding out of their pockets.</p><p>This is why the Find N5 gets me excited. I can see this as the precursor to an eventual multi-fold phone from the company, with OPPO shaving a few millimeters off the 12.8mm thickness of the Mate XT. That would help make this new type of foldable a more palatable option for consumers in the market for a versatile smartphone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1482px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="beejucHabxp52LGyttbNwj" name="huawei-mate-xt-promo-2.jpg" alt="Huawei Mate XT promo image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/beejucHabxp52LGyttbNwj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1482" height="834" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Huawei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Other devices and form factors also stand to gain from this. We've already seen what OnePlus and OPPO can achieve with the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">OnePlus Watch 3</a>/OPPO Watch X2, which can last a full five days in smart mode and 16 days in power save mode. That's more than any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a>, and it's the result of OnePlus and OPPO squeezing in a much larger battery without the watch becoming too unwieldy.</p><p>I'm particularly excited about how this can improve flip phones. Despite being my favorite smartphone form factor, I recently laid out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-android-oems-can-improve-flip-phones">my grievances with flip phones</a> and the compromises that come with them, including the thick was of the devices when folded. After all, what's the point of having a compact phone when it's literally double the thickness of a normal smartphone when folded?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-review-13.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 folded on a ledge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vbzXkAgieD2nDxmoFAFZfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4149" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During a briefing at the Find N5 launch, OPPO hinted that the advancements we see in its battery tech could arrive in a future flip phone. And while we have no official word on a long-awaited successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a>, this all but tells me that we could be in for a thinner, more impressive flip phone sooner than I had hoped. Motorola had better watch out!</p>
<h2 id="no-more-excuses-2">No more excuses</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to other foldables" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g96pvBZ3R3rWGXCVzMYXv4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has been very vocal about making foldables mainstream and has invested a lot of money into making that happen. The Z Fold and Z Flip series had a few years of impressive growth thanks to refined design, enhanced durability, and improved durability. However, we've seen growth slow down lately, which seems to coincide with Samsung's perceived slowdown in innovation.</p><p>As a result, Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">reportedly lowering its shipping targets</a> for its upcoming foldables. However, its recent quarterly earnings report hints that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-q4-2024-earnings-report-detailed">Samsung is confident</a> that its foldable offerings this year could help drive more demand as the competition seemingly surpasses it in terms of design, innovation, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://huaweicentral.com/huawei-dethrones-samsung-as-global-foldable-leader-in-q4-2024/">shipments</a>.</p><p>There's really no reason the largest Android OEM should be ceding its foldable crown to others. However, after the launch of the Find N5, there's a lot riding on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 to bring something exciting.</p><p>With OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-not-launching-the-open-2-is-a-massive-win-for-samsung">skipping a 2025 launch</a> of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> successor, Samsung now has the perfect opening to take back its foldable crown without too much competition getting in the way. And with any luck, Samsung will take a page from competitors like OPPO when it comes to design to give us thin, durable, and exciting foldable phones. Because if it won't, we can be sure <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/only-apple-can-save-foldables-now-after-oneplus-bows-out-this-year">Apple's eventual foldable will</a>.</p>

Well, it's interesting if you enjoy eBooks or copyright law, or just like to watch huge tech companies do stupid things. You might even enjoy all three; if so you hit the jackpot.</p><p>On one side we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-kindle-users-to-loose-download-transfer-via-usb-feature">Amazon cracking down</a> on people who move Kindle books to a computer. There are legitimate reasons you might want to do this, but one of the biggest reasons is so that you can strip the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-kindle-scribe-review">Kindle</a> DRM away from the document and can use any reader software to enjoy your book.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div>
<p>The issue is that once you've stripped away that DRM (Digital Rights Management) you can also upload and share that work with someone who didn't give Amazon any money for it. That's stealing and against the law no matter how you or I feel about it. More importantly to Amazon, it means the company loses a potential sale.</p>
<p>On the other side, we have Meta. You know, the company that used to be Facebook but has morphed into an AI company that happens to own WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram among others. Their AI is pretty good, too. On par with the offerings from Google and OpenAI, Meta's Llama AI models are open source and used by other AI companies like DeepSeek.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1888019174133276846" target="_blank">According to court records</a>, Meta allegedly illegally pirated 82TB of DRM-free eBooks to train <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">Llama</a>. That's 8.2e+13 bytes of data, a number that's basically unfathomable to normal people who don't love math. These court records show that Meta knew it was wrong, did it anyway, and made jokes about it.</p><p>Way back in October of 2022 senior AI researchers said things like "<em>I don’t think we should use pirated material. I really need to draw a line here</em>” and “<em>Using pirated material should be beyond our ethical threshold.</em>” One even added, “<em>SciHub, ResearchGate, LibGen are basically like PirateBay or something like that, they are distributing content that is protected by copyright and they’re infringing it</em>.”</p><p>After some gentle nudging from Mark Zuckerberg himself, things changed. The company took steps to make sure the torrenting couldn't be traced back to Meta's network infrastructure and began sailing under the black flag.</p><p>The tone of the messages between employees changed from stoic refusal to things like "<em>torrenting from a corporate laptop doesn’t feel right </em>😂." Emoji included.</p>

<p>It's alleged — remember Meta hasn't been found guilty of anything yet — that this shows both evidence of the unlawful activity and how Meta took deliberate steps to try and get away with it. The case against Meta is still ongoing so we have no idea if the writers who are suing the company will be able to get some sort of satisfaction.</p><p>In any case, Android Central has reached out to Meta for a comment regarding the allegations against it and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>"Stealing" content to train AI isn't anything new. Google scrapes every bit of free content on the internet and much of it is used to train <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-experimental-advanced-is-googles-best-ai-model-yet-and-its-available-now">Gemini models</a> which often plagiarize the actual source. OpenAI and Microsoft have faced several lawsuits similar to the current one against Meta, including an ongoing case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/27/24016212/new-york-times-openai-microsoft-lawsuit-copyright-infringement" target="_blank">brought by the New York Times</a> for "billions of dollars in statutory and actual damages" for using millions of NYT articles to build a competitor without paying for it.</p><p>Nvidia allegedly scrapes "A human lifetime" of video every day to train its AI models according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.404media.co/nvidia-ai-scraping-foundational-model-cosmos-project/" target="_blank">documents leaked to 404 Media</a>., and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> is being investigated for allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a0dfedd1-5255-4fa9-8ccc-1fe01de87ea6" target="_blank">obtaining content from ChatGPT illegally</a>. That's a lot of "allegedly" but still very concerning.</p>

<p>It feels like all these tech giants do whatever the hell they please when it comes to copyright, but you shouldn't do the same. The financial penalties are peanuts to companies like Google or Meta but would ruin the average person. We've seen that happen; pirating music <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_piracy#:~:text=The%20RIAA%2C%20a%20powerful%20lobby,to%20a%20dentist%20like%20me%22." target="_blank">can cost you $150,000 for every song</a> you download illegally.</p><p>Equally important is the message this gives. If it's OK for a company like Meta to steal eBooks then you can do the same thing, though the reality is that both are wrong. The difference is that if you have a huge war chest and legal team, you can get away with it.</p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do. I try very hard to pay for all the content I consume, but if it's not easy to pay for it I've fired up a torrent client to get what I wanted or used a web archive to get around a paywall. I think most people are the same.</p><p>In the long run, someone will find another way to strip Kindle DRM, eBook piracy sites aren't going away, and Meta will fight and appeal until Zuck gets a slap on the wrist for doing something that would financially ruin you or me.</p><p>The world keeps turning.</p>

According to Android Central's Michael Hicks, the "active crown, fixed health tracking, eye-friendly display, smarter coprocessor, and larger battery capacity," takes it a notch higher than its predecessor.</p><p>The wearable has a 1.5-inch LTPO flexible display and a stainless steel exterior with a Titanium PVD (Physical Vapor Deposition) bezel. What's more, is that the smartwatch has a dual chipset— the Snapdragon W5 and the new BES2800 MCU Efficiency which helps the WearOS 5 accomplish complex tasks.</p><p>"It not only enhances its operating speed but also significantly reduces power consumption, resulting in extended battery life," OnePlus added.</p><p>The company builds on the watch's battery, promising a 5-day battery life on Smart mode, which Nick Sutrich said has surpassed this limit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">after spending 10 days with the watch</a>, thanks to the larger 631mAh Silicon NanoStack Battery.</p><p>The Watch 3 comes with a new feature called the 60S Health check-in that will give users a physical and mental health report in just 60 seconds and also gains an IP68 rating which allows the device to be submerged in 1.5 meters of freshwater for up to 30 minutes. The OnePlus Watch 3 will have two colorways: Obsidian Titanium and Emerald Titanium and is priced at $330.</p><p>While focusing on what's built into the watch, OnePlus seems to have missed out on a tiny detail. A user on Reddit noticed a minor error with the wearable, where the company ended up engraving "Meda in China" instead of "Made in China," on the first batch that went out. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china" target="_blank">Admitting its mistake</a> OnePlus took to X (formerly Twitter) to put all the chatter to rest around the hilarious typo, stating it was completely unintentional.</p><p>"A typo slipped through and made its way onto your shiny new OnePlus Watch 3," the company said. And if users seem to have received one that says "Meda" on the wearable, they have one of two options. They can either keep it as a 'super limited edition' or return it to the company for a brand new one — minus the typo of course.</p>

Measuring just 8.92mm when folded and 4.21mm when open, the OPPO Find N5 comes with a 6.62-inch cover display and an 8.12-inch inner screen.</p><p>The most powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, is at the core of this foldable which is paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. Out of the box it runs on ColorOS 15.0.1, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Giving it a 4.5-star rating, Jonnaagadda said, "Once you combine all of that (hardware) with fluid software and meaningful multitasking features, it's no wonder that the Find N5 is now my favorite foldable phone."</p><p>When it comes to the cameras,  it looks similar to its predecessor with curved corners— but it is so sleek that the array barely peeps out of the back panel, with 9.0mm thickness.  It comes with a 50MP main camera, an 8MP ultra-wide, and a 50MP telephoto lens for 3x optical zoom. Selfies and video calls are captured with 8MP front cameras on both the outer and inner displays.</p><p>The phone comes with a 5,600mAh battery that supports 80W wired charging and 50W wireless. The Find N5 will cost around $1,867, but won't be seen in the U.S. anytime soon.</p>

In a YouTube video showcasing the device, Nothing says that the Phone 3a series will have a 50MP main camera sensor, an 8MP Ultra-wide, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the rear.</p><p>Additionally, it will showcase another 50 MP front camera consisting of a periscope telephoto lens, that is said to come with a 3x optical zoom and a 6x "in-sensor zoom".</p><p>While boasting about the above, in the same YouTube video, the company mistakingly compared the lower-quality ultra-wide camera of the Phone 16 Pro Max to the Nothing Phone 3a's main camera. After several viewers spotted this potentially misleading comparison, Nothing said this was made as a result of an editing mistake and wasn't intentional. It then put out the following statement in a pinned YouTube comment and on Nothing's community page:</p><p>"Hey everyone, we shot across all lenses throughout the day (sometimes cycling one-handed on a bumpy road), and in editing, a clip shot using the iPhone 16 Pro Max’s ultrawide lens was mistakenly used in the video stabilization comparison instead of one shot using its standard lens. There was no intent to mislead, and we’ll be more careful to ensure even greater scrutiny in future comparisons. Appreciate you all keeping us accountable!"</p>

While Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> is expected to power the Pixel 9a. Colorways seem to be consistent across previous leaks, like Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris. Lastly, the publication suggests the Pixel 9a could see a price hike in the U.S. starting at $499.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Apple is now offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/">a new budget iPhone</a> with something really cool inside of it. I'm not talking about Apple's AI features; the iPhone 16e and its binned SoC prove that Apple could offer more features to older phones if it wanted to do it. I'm talking about something most people don't care about — the modem.</p><p>The 16e is the first iPhone that uses Apple's new in-house C1 5G modem, which the company developed after a lot of expensive R&D and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/07/apple-to-acquire-the-majority-of-intels-smartphone-modem-business/">buying out Intel's 5G business</a>. It's a modem that doesn't match up very well with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-x75-5g-modem">Qualcomm's</a>, at least on paper.</p>
<p>This is a bigger deal than you might think because Apple's C1 has no support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">millimeter-wave 5G</a> frequencies. That means two things — it will never get the hyper-fast 5G speeds we were promised and you might have seen yourself, and the network coverage in many places will be sub-par or fallback to LTE (4G).</p><p>This is because most of the technology to power a millimeter-wave modem is from Qualcomm. The company invented or re-invented it and marketed it in a way that it has become almost mandatory in North America. A lot of network tech is Qualcomm's and I imagine Apple has liscensed a good bit of it for its in-house offering, but it either declined to pay for better millimeter-wave support or Qualcomm is unwilling to license it at a cost Apple finds fair.</p>

<p>I have no special affinity for Apple products but I don't like what I'm seeing here. On one hand, you might think that this proves Apple doesn't need Qualcomm so other manufacturers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apples-c1-modem-in-the-iphone-16e-is-proof-that-we-dont-need-qualcomm-for-5g">might not need the company, either</a>. That's true if you're OK with a sub-par product with missing features found in many devices at all price ranges.</p><p>What I see is that even Apple, a company with more than enough resources to do almost anything it imagines, couldn't break the grip Qualcomm has in North America.</p><p>We have no details about the process or licensing agreements (and probably never will) so we don't know exactly why Apple decided to forgo millimeter-wave 5G but I'm sure it's a decision that wasn't made lightly. Apple does not want its "budget" phone to be worse than a $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-n30-5g-review">OnePlus Nord</a> when it comes to network performance, but it will in places like New York or Chicago.</p>
<p>Apple says it has plans to expand the C1's usage to other models in its lineup. I'm betting it will find a way to integrate millimeter-wave technology before that happens.</p><p>What I know for sure is that Apple and Qualcomm have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/apple-infringed-three-qualcomm-patents-jury-finds-idUSKCN1QW2JZ/" target="_blank">long-standing love-hate relationship</a> and this almost certainly factored its way into the decision-making process. Qualcomm does have competitors like Samsung and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-likely-to-bring-satellite-connectivity-to-pixel-9-series">Exynos 5G modems</a> and there is more to a cellular modem than millimeter-wave support. There's also no denying that Qualcomm does it better. A lot better.</p><p>Qualcomm makes a great line of products, there is no denying that. It's just disheartening to see one company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2017/01/ftc-charges-qualcomm-monopolizing-key-semiconductor-device-used-cell-phones" target="_blank">have such a strong grip</a> that it can stifle competitors or charge exorbitant fees for patented IPs. If Intel couldn't do it, and Apple can't do it, can anyone?</p>

<ul><li>In an interview with Wareable, a OnePlus rep acknowledged that the one-size Watch 3 "remains heavy for a small wrist."</li><li>He promised that they will "fix" the lack of a small option this year, which could suggest a smaller OnePlus Watch 3R or Watch 4.</li><li>He also discussed the reason why the OnePlus Watch 3 only has an LTE version in China.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> has impressed us so far with its incredible battery life, we don't know how long it would last with a lighter, more comfortable case size. But based on statements from Dr. Leo Zhang, the Head of R&D at the OnePlus Health Lab, they're "working on" a smaller OnePlus Watch that should answer that question soon.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/news/oneplus-2025-smartwatch-smaller-case-size-lte-edition">PULSE by Wareable</a>, which interviewed Zhang, quotes him as saying, "It’s true that the [46mm OnePlus Watch 3] remains heavy for a small wrist and that this typically affects women, but we will fix that this year. We value our customer’s voice and we’re working on that."</p><p>As much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2">OnePlus Watch 3 improved on the Watch 2</a>, a smaller model was one of the few requested changes that OnePlus <em>didn't</em> deliver this year. The Watch 3 weighs about 50g without the strap or 80g with it; that's lighter than the 60g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but significantly heavier than the 34g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> or 37g <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> with comparable display sizes.</p><p>Given that OnePlus will "fix that" in 2025, we could theoretically see a smaller OnePlus Watch 3R this summer — a successor to the sporty <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a> — but the Watch 4 in 2026 seems more likely. Either way, we think plenty of people would lose a day or two of battery life and swap from a 1.5- to 1.3-inch display to make the OnePlus Watch 4 less distractingly hefty.</p>

<p>In this same interview, Wareable asked Zhang about the lack of an LTE option in North America and Europe.</p><p>"The technology isn’t a problem, that part is quite simple," Zhang explained. "In China’s domestic market, we have an LTE version. In an overseas market, we need to work with the carriers—and that’s a big hurdle. We need to work with carriers so users can put in an eSIM and have a data plan."</p><p>Zhang continued on to tell the site that they're also "working on" adding LTE by speaking with carriers, "especially in Europe."</p><p>Unlike his promise about a smaller OnePlus Watch, he didn't give a timetable for adding LTE, whether to the Watch 3, Watch 4, or a later model. And based on his words, it appears OnePlus's first priority will be to bring LTE to Europe before it focuses on the United States, where its wearable sales may be lower.</p><p>OnePlus has had a slightly messy Watch 3 launch week, given its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-cant-use-meta-in-china-but-the-oneplus-watch-3-is-meda-in-china">"Meda in China" typo</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-has-set-interesting-standard-with-wear-os-5-and-oneplus-watch-3">disappointingly short update promise</a>. Despite this, we're highly encouraged to see OnePlus prioritizing a smaller watch design, in order to make its watches more competitive with the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Google revealed the date of I/O 2025 last week with an interactive puzzle game.</li><li>Later, it shared that key parts of the game were made using the Gemini API and Google AI Studio.</li><li>Google says leveraging AI to build the game saved time creating things that otherwise could've been done manually.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>By now, you probably know that Google I/O 2025 — the company's annual developer conference — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-date-official">is happening May 20 and May 21, 2025 at Shoreline Amphitheatre</a> in Mountain View, California. The company announced as much last week, by way of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/you-can-help-reveal-google-i-o-2025s-date-with-prism-shift-puzzle-game">a fun puzzle game with lasers, prisms, and mirrors</a>. But you might not know that Google used the Gemini API and the Google AI Studio to make the "Save the date" puzzle for the first time this year.</p><p>Google created secret levels for the puzzle game this year for the most passionate completionists out there. When a puzzle is loading, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini API</a> adds a secret tile on the game's board and presents a clever riddle to help players find it. You'll need to solve these Gemini-created riddles to unlock the bonus levels. Google says this kind of thing is something it could've manually coded, but the Gemini API and Google AI Studio helped it save time.</p><p>"Google AI Studio helped us integrate the feature faster in a unique, creative way," said Jay Chang, a senior product marketing manager at Google, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-io-2025-puzzle-ai/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. "We programmatically generated the prompts for Gemini 1.5 Flash, using code, and then let it get creative in how it crafted the riddles."</p><p>It's a unique preview of what can be done with the Gemini API and Google AI Studio to save app developers time while creating new experiences. It's also very fitting for the Google I/O 2025, since the event's main focus is to help developers learn and try the new APIs and AI features Google introduces each year. That's what I/O is all about — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everyone-is-talking-about-google-i-o-but-what-exactly-is-it-and-who-is-it-for">it's not really for the average Android user</a>.</p>

<p>There's also a bit of deeper meaning behind Google's choice of lasers and mirrors, beyond looking like the "I" and "O" in Google I/O.</p><p>“Prisms and mirrors are integral tools in quantum computing, used to manipulate and analyze light and quantum states," explained Kacey Fahey, a Google senior product marketing manager. "This year's puzzle design was inspired by these concepts, challenging players to use reflections and refractions to solve complex puzzles."</p><p>You can still replay the Google I/O 2025 puzzle game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/puzzle" target="_blank">here</a>, as you wait for the developer conference to start in late May.

<ul><li>T-Mobile is using a private 5G network to power Major League Baseball's ABS system in Spring Training this year.</li><li>Free MLB.tv access is available for T-Mobile customers for the 10th straight MLB season.</li><li>You can claim your season-long MLB.tv subscription for free in the T-Life app late next month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>For the first time, Major League Baseball players in Spring Training will be able to challenge a ball or strike call on a thrown pitch using an automatic ball-strike (ABS) system. It won't impact the 2025 regular season — the ABS system is currently in the testing stage at Spring Training for about 60% of games — but it is a big deal for the sport. As it turns out, the ABS system is powered by a private <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile 5G network</a>, as the carrier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/offers/t-mobile-and-mlb-bring-5g-powered-automated-ball-strike-system?norewrite=UUapUeUpU1025421" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 21.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> is the official wireless parter of MLB, and thus it's using a private network under its Advanced Network Solution (ANS) umbrella to provide a 5G connection for the ABS system. Hawk-Eye cameras set up by MLB are positioned around Spring Training stadiums to "triangulate" the strike zone, T-Mobile says. From there, the private ANS network from T-Mobile transmits data to and from parts of the ABS system over 5G.</p><p>Corporate use cases like this one are part of the reason 5G exists. The technology can elicit fast, secure connections between wireless devices. Recently, T-Mobile announced plans to use another private ANS system to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-5g-miller-electric-partnership-autonomous-vehicles">power a self-driving car project in Jacksonville, Florida</a>. Now, a similar 5G network will facilitate the ABS system at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Florida, starting today.</p><p>For T-Mobile customers and baseball fans, the more exciting announcement might be that MLB.tv is free for the 10th straight season. Subscribers of T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Home Internet and Small Business plans will be able to redeem season-long MLB.tv access in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-old-t-mobile-app-is-officially-gone-for-good-time-to-download-t-life">T-Life app</a>. Keep your eye out, because a MLB.tv plan typically costs $150 and you can only claim it between March 25 and March 31.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hSPCfN9yKubtVzuTDG6jiL" name="T-Mobile-MLBTV" alt="T-Mobile is working with MLB for the ABS system and MLB.tv" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hSPCfN9yKubtVzuTDG6jiL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the MLB.tv subscription doesn't offer most in-market games due to blackouts. You'll still need cable for that, but MLB.tv will work with all out-of-market games during the 2025 season. Considering it's free with your T-Mobile cellular or internet plan, there's no downside to claiming it. And one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPN apps for Android</a> might just solve that blackout problem.</p><p>According to T-Mobile, MLB.tv access is one of the most popular free perks offered by the carrier. It says T-Mobile customers streamed 58 million hours of live baseball during the 2024 season, which is a record.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-157">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Meet has swapped some of its in-app controls in an attempt to "organize features more intuitively."</li><li>Emoji reactions will now be visible in the bottom bar, while the hand raise option takes a back seat in the three-dot menu.</li><li>These changes will reflect on both Android and iOS devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google seems like it is focused on creating a more seamless experience for its users on Meet. In a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-call-control-updates.html">Workspace update post</a>, Google said it is rearranging some of its in-app controls on Meet so that its most used features are easily accessible, "this will help you to navigate the Meet layout faster and more intuitively," the post added.</p><p>To start, Emoji reactions that were once hidden in the three-dot menu will now take position front and center, within the bottom bar on the Meet call screen. This will help users quickly react to conversations, by Simply tapping the Emoji toggle to access or hide the reaction picker.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="73RBn7aLF5MfVgzYVd3QeH" name="Google-Meet-Emoji-Reacts" alt="Gif showing Emoji Reacts on Google Meet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/73RBn7aLF5MfVgzYVd3QeH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="288" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Secondly, the 'hand raise' feature has now been moved to the triple-dot menu, from Meet's bottom access bar, swapping it with the emoji reactions. It's unclear why Google would choose to hide the hand raise option since most people tend to use it on work calls.</p><p>Seems like the company was focusing on the personal meet conversations while making this change. It is important to note that these changes will only reflect on mobile devices, if you’re using a larger screen device, such as a tablet, the 'Hand Raise' icon will remain in the bottom bar or the main call menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="bZ6KZSGY7p8Boinx2zzVsi" name="Google-Meet-Handraise" alt="Hand Raise on Google Meet moved" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bZ6KZSGY7p8Boinx2zzVsi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="288" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, Google is cleaning things up with the overflow menu on the app so that it looks a little less cluttered. With the redesign, the 'Host management controls' will now be moved deep within the settings menu, under the “General” section. The option to 'report a problem' will also be seated in the Settings menu, giving the main call menu a less cluttered look.</p><p>These changes have already started showing up on Android devices, as of Feb.20, and will be seen on iOS devices starting Feb.24. For Android phones, the minimum build required to see these updates is:</p><p><strong>Meet: 291.0.722438190.duo.android_20250202.14</strong></p><p><strong>Gmail: 2025.02.02.722438226</strong></p><p>Lastly, Google switched the end call button to the bottom right instead of the left side, only for iOS users. Along with these redesign changes, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/google-meet-call-control-updates.html" target="_blank">recently announced </a>that the transcripts for Live Captions and Translate on Meet that only remained on the screen briefly will now be available for 30 minutes.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's delays bringing One UI 7 to older devices have been well-chronicled, and that continues as the company seeded its fifth beta update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24</a> series today, Feb. 21. The minor update is appearing for U.S. users on AT&T and Verizon to start, and is available as an OTA update for users in the One UI 7 Beta program, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s24-one-ui-7-beta-5-update-usa/">SamMobile</a>.</p><p>This update comes just days after the fourth One UI 7 beta, and carries a version number of <strong>S92xU1UEU4ZYBB</strong>. It's available for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, and Galaxy S24 Ultra if the device is enrolled in the beta program already. It's relatively small, with an update size of roughly 450MB, according to SamMobile. The exact size of the update may depend on your device and carrier. The patch might arrive in other regions and networks in the future.</p><p>To see if your Galaxy S24 is eligible for the update, open the <strong>Settings app</strong> and navigate to <strong>Software update </strong>> <strong>Download and install</strong>.</p>

<p>The latest One UI 7 beta update comes a few weeks after Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">acknowledged that the operating system's release for older phones would be delayed</a>. In a community post Feb. 6, the company said it planned to release a fourth beta update fixing a bug that "causes the display color temperature to appear more yellow than intended." Of course, if you're keeping track at home, the update released today is the <em>fifth</em> One UI 7 beta update for Galaxy S24 owners in the U.S.</p><p>According to the patch's release notes, this update includes a fix for a Visual Voicemail crash problem reported by testers.</p><p>It's unclear when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> will reach stability for the Galaxy S24 lineup and other Galaxy phones. Shortly after the Galaxy S25 debuted, Samsung pledged to bring it to older devices "imminently" and that users should expect it sometime in Q1 2025. We don't know if that timetable has been pushed back due to the latest round of delays.</p>

<hr>
<p>Reports are springing up from Fitbit's past-gen smartwatch owners about a severe battery life issue following a recent emergency update.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/616719/fitbit-versa-3-sense-overheating-battery-wearables">The Verge</a>, users on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/td-p/5718530">Fitbit forums</a> have started voicing their displeasure regarding a drastic drop in smartwatch battery life. The thread's original poster (OP) states that following Google's mandatory patch for the Versa 3,  version 36.128.6.21, their device lasts "less than a day." While this is coming off a full charge, the OP explains they turned "everything off" on the device, too.</p><p>This means their Versa 3's notifications, snore detection, vibrations, and more were all disabled to try and squeeze as much battery life out of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, the patch is causing the watch's battery to drop and (the wrong) record speeds. The user adds it's made their watch virtually "useless" as they're unable to accurately capture sleep data or go for a run.</p><p>Several other users chimed in, stating their Versa 3 is experiencing the same downward trend following Google's mandatory patch. One user claims they had to charge their watch "twice in one day" as it can't make it without doing so.</p><p>Similar to the OP, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/m-p/5722672/highlight/true#M321458">one user said</a> their Versa 3 would last roughly five to six days without needing another charge. Following the patch, they're experiencing disconnects, a lack of notifications, and more frequent required charges.</p><p>The publication spotted reports about the Fitbit Sense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1ip7m4u/fitbit_sense_battery_suddenly_very_poor_dies_in/">on Reddit</a>, too.</p>

<p>It's not like the sudden battery changes are coming from left field as, in January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-sense-versa-3-battery-overheating-warning-reported">Google sent a warning</a> to all Sense and Versa 3 owners about severe overheating issues. Both devices were getting far too hot to the point that they could cause physical harm to the user wearing them. The company informed users that it was working on a patch to "reduce the risk" of the issue.</p><p>More importantly, Google stated in its announcement, "the battery will last for shorter periods between charges."</p><p>Granted, the company was never clear as to how short "shorter" means for either device. Versa 3 owners are reportedly struggling to even go a full day on a single charge after reaching a maximum of six. Fitbit Moderators on the forum have reiterated the same statement made by Google in January, as well.</p><p>Further, one moderator <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Other-Versa-Smartwatches/Versa-3-Battery-issues-after-firmware-update/m-p/5726359/highlight/true#M321580">recently instructed a user</a> to Google's Sense and Versa 3 compensation page due to their battery life issues. Like the company's original warning, it told users to provide information, and if their device qualifies, they would deliver $50 in compensation for the issues. If your device's battery life draining severely, perhaps you could do the same.</p><p>Fitbit has a long history of overheating devices, beginning with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-is-recalling-over-1-million-ionic-smartwatches-heres-why">its old Ionic smartwatches</a> from 2022. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-hit-with-another-lawsuit">second lawsuit</a> came in 2022, as well, a couple of months after the first as users were getting burned by overheating devices.</p>

<p>The supposed Galaxy Z Flip FE is bearing the SM-F761B model number. The model number corroborates with an earlier spotting of the same device bearing F761BXXU0AYB1 firmware from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-indirectly-confirms-cheaper-galaxy-z-flip/">last week</a>.</p><p>Aside from the model number and the new firmware, very little is known about the Galaxy Z Flip FE. Early rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-is-likely-coming-in-2025">have indicated</a> that the clamshell phone is likely to debut alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7 foldables later this year.</p>
<p>The expected specifications of the handset comprise a 6.7-inch AMOLED panel with Full HD+ resolution and 120Hz refresh rate. Additionally, the display, that is likely to be utilized, is the Ultra-Thin-Glass (UTG). One UI 7.0 is expected, which is Android 15-based. The device is also tipped to use an Exynos chip, possibly an Exynos 2400, per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-fe-s24-internal-chip-rumors">previous leak</a>.</p><p>The Fan Edition flip phone is also expected to have a 50MP primary camera and support for 25W fast charging, although there is no word about the battery capacity yet.</p>
<p>From all the Galaxy foldables that Samsung makes every year the Flip series is significantly cheaper than the book-style phones, and the company choosing a clamshell phone as an affordable option, comes as no surprise.</p><p>With the model numbers and firmware popping up, we could see more of the Galaxy Z Flip FE in the coming months.</p>
