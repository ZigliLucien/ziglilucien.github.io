If something broke, like a cracked screen or worn-out battery, your only option was to replace the entire unit. That changes with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-hands-on">Pixel Watch 4</a>.</p><p>Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">latest and greatest smartwatch</a>, the Pixel Watch 4, is making headlines, not just because of its software or fitness tracking, but because it’s finally something you can realistically repair yourself.</p><p>For the first three Pixel Watch generations, a cracked screen or dying battery meant you'd likely get the whole device replaced, not fixed. But when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/113620/the-pixel-watch-4-is-the-most-repairable-smartwatch-on-the-market" target="_blank">iFixit</a> tore down the Pixel Watch 4, the site concluded it’s the most repairable smartwatch on the market.</p><h2 id="screws-over-glue-2">Screws over glue</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3pQWBFBIU2U" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The teardown reveals design decisions that prioritize access over obfuscation: two Torx T2 screws under the band let you pop open the case without ripping through adhesives. The battery and display themselves are secured with screws (T2 and some T5s) instead of glue.</p><p>Reassembly still retains the watch’s IP68 / 5ATM water resistance thanks to a silicone O-ring seal. Of course, this more open approach comes with some caveats. The repairability offered applies primarily to the battery and display.</p><p>Also, to facilitate easier opening, Google appears to have changed the charging method. The Pixel Watch 4 comes with a side-charging cradle rather than the old magnetic or pogo-pin style used in prior models.</p><p>That means older chargers won’t work, and there’s concern this is just another proprietary twist. Still, the side-charging layout might help by giving repair technicians unobstructed rear access.</p><h2 id="parts-and-warranty-no-strings-2">Parts and warranty, no strings</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Quick-Charge-Dock" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 held in hand with the Quick Charge Dock magnetically attached to the bottom." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G4GtXkThPfe5ifEhCKQzGm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This matters beyond repair. Google will sell spare parts via iFixit, not just to authorized shops.

The change also highlights how far the Pixel line has come. Earlier models scored poorly in repairability.</p><p>By contrast, the Pixel Watch 4 gets a very high mark: 9/10.

However, one often overlooked category is hybrid smartwatches, which blend a traditional mechanical watch with smart features.</p><p>These "smart" watches may seem boring and not very smart at all, but there's actually a lot more to them than meets the eye. Inside their often small displays is a host of features for owners to utilize while keeping things minimal. It's part of what makes these watches so versatile, and among the reasons why you should consider a hybrid smartwatch as your next wearable buy.</p><h2 id="form-over-function-2">Form over function</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe" name="Withings ScanWatch Nova" alt="Withings ScanWatch Nova against green background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8mwc4eXw8WkS7G8gVJDXoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One complaint many have about smartwatches is that they <em>look </em>like smartwatches. Unlike the Apple Watch, which is the farthest from a traditional watch by design, Android smartwatches often try to emulate the traditional watch style, with varying degrees of success.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch</a> is unapologetically a smartwatch, thanks to its bulbous design and domed display, particularly on the latest model. Then there's the Galaxy Watch, which recently updated its design, but still retains a very "smartwatch" design. The closest we've gotten to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> that resemble traditional watches are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> and the Fossil watches of yore, both of which emulate the look and feel of a watch while retaining a rotating crown.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AjASiMALJuaqzT8eUv3XAQ" name="smartwatch-beauty-pageant-all-candidates" alt="A side view of thirteen smartwatches sitting side-by-side on a desk.

If it weren't for the display found in some shape or form on a hybrid watch, you likely wouldn't know there was anything "smart" about it.</p><p>For some, this is a benefit. When I go out and want to look particularly nice, I normally leave my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> or Galaxy Watch at home, and instead reach for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/withings-scanwatch-2-review">Withings ScanWatch 2</a>. This is one of the best-looking "smart" watches I've used, and my opinion was validated during a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> held by Android Central's Michael Hicks. Out of 13 smartwatches, the ScanWatch 2 won the most votes, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> came in second place.</p><p>Meanwhile, the more mainstream <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> came in second to last place, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> was in 8th place. The results suggest that, to the everyday person, the classic watch style is the best design option.</p><h2 id="keep-it-simple-2">Keep it simple</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj" name="Garmin-vivomove-trend-notifications.jpeg" alt="The notifications screen on the Garmin vívoactive Trend" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GpkUFxtS3gxXouBCobMWFj.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from a classic design that almost anyone can get into, one of the best aspects of a hybrid smartwatch is its simplicity. Compared to the large, vibrant touch screens on a regular smartwatch, a hybrid smartwatch normally has a smaller display with minimal navigation. There are no apps to download, no watch faces to customize; you just have a set of features and settings that you can turn on or off.</p><p>Even a hybrid watch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-vivomove-trend-review">Garmin Vivomove Trend</a> has a full touch screen, but it only provides very basic menus while giving you more room to read messages and notifications.</p><p>Some may prefer this minimalism, as it offers much less distraction compared to smartwatches, which always seem to invite you to look at them. After all, if the point of a smartwatch is that you're glancing at your phone less, then that becomes moot if you're constantly looking at your watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-3" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open to a workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nv6FVK3he4rcEynmWwzKRm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4021" height="2262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A hybrid smartwatch will still get things done in the background. They can measure health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, and even ECG on some models. Think of it as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring</a> with a watch face that still gathers important data and pings you for notifications you might want to pay attention to. The minimal displays are best used for glanceable information, forcing you to decide whether something is worth grabbing your phone for or if it can wait.</p><p>You can still track workouts on something like the ScanWatch 2 or Garmin Instinc Crossover, but the menus are often simplified and options are fairly limited, so you're not spending all your time navigating.</p><p>Basically, a hybrid smartwatch isn't begging for your attention; it's for anyone looking for a more passive health tracking experience. Otherwise, it'll function as a pretty normal watch.</p><h2 id="battery-life-for-days-or-weeks-2">Battery life for days (or weeks)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm" name="Withings-ScanWatch-2-review-5" alt="The Withings ScanWatch 2 next to a phone with the Withings app open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DCqBBueQe9EtWcG7at75cm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Because there's no big, battery-sucking touch screen to deal with, some hybrid smartwatches will usually have better battery life than the average smartwatch. Take the ScanWatch 2; on average, it can last just over a month before you need to find your charger. Meanwhile, the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch</a> or Pixel Watch models will only last a few days at most.</p><p>The Vivomove Trend lasts only five days, likely due to its large touch screen, but that's more than you'll get from an Apple Watch or most Wear OS watches. The exception is the OnePlus Watch 3, which also manages up to five days of battery life, although it is quite large.</p><p>That said, the less you have to charge your watch, the better it can function effectively as a watch, especially when it comes to performing its primary function: telling time. It's kind of dead weight if it's constantly dead.</p><h2 id="just-one-problem-2">Just one problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q" name="Fossil-Gen-6-Hybrid-Wellness-Edition-review-indoors.jpg" alt="The Fossil Gen 6 Hybrid Wellness Edition lying on a flat surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y5jrdeXpHBE5yYqXgHmX8Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3580" height="2014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, when it comes to hybrid smartwatches, the selection is pretty small. Fossil had a pretty solid selection, but when it bowed out of the smartwatch market, it took all its brands with it, including Skagen. That left a huge gap in the hybrid smartwatch market (not to mention the Wear OS market), which is mostly filled by Withings and its various ScanWatch models.</p><p>There's also the Garmin Vivomove Trend or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-instinct-crossover-amoled-hybrid-watch-announced">Instinct Crossover</a> series, but it really depends on the style you're going for.

They're not coming back, either.</p><p>Since the smartphone revolution in the mid-00s, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/facebook-was-most-downloaded-app-decade">Facebook</a>, YouTube, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/instagram-extends-its-ban-self-harm-depiction-fictional-posts">Instagram</a>, Snapchat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-registers-2-billion-global-downloads-according-latest-data?region-switch=GB">TikTok</a> — a cascade of platforms have migrated from desktops to pockets. Suddenly, social connection is immediate and inescapable. The age of entry has also plummeted. Despite age restrictions, kids routinely navigate these digital waters, often unsupervised.</p><p>Social media does offer an opportunity for connection. For children geographically isolated or those seeking kinship around niche interests or identities, online platforms can be a lifesaver. The internet fosters creative expression, allowing kids to become filmmakers, artists, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-storybook-gem-is-proof-google-can-make-ai-good">storytellers</a>. It provides access to information, facilitating learning and even civic engagement. It allows people to stand up for causes they believe in and organize social movements. It's not all bad.

Some say we're seeing a rise in anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, fueled by trying to create the perfect online life. Experts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://renucounselling.ca/tiktok-brain/">express concerns</a> about the impact of constant stimulation on developing brains, particularly impulse control and emotional regulation.</p><p>The internet's anonymity fosters cyberbullying and harassment. Late-night scrolling can rob children (and adults) of sleep, leaving them tired and emotionally vulnerable. And perhaps most worrying, an over-reliance on digital interaction can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newyorkbehavioralhealth.com/the-impact-of-social-media-use-on-social-skills/">stunt the development of crucial real-life social skills</a>.</p><p>Then there is the question of exposure to harmful content and the addictive nature of algorithmically curated content.

The Pixel Watch 1 launched in October 2022 with Wear OS 3.5 and is currently running the April 2025 Wear OS 5.1 update.</p><p>Google initially told us it had no comment about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">Pixel Watch 1</a>, but a Google spokesperson sent us a statement on Friday that clarified its update strategy:</p><div><blockquote><p>We’re committed to providing a great experience across the entire Pixel Watch portfolio to make your devices get better over time, which includes three years of essential support to deliver new features, enhancements, and security updates. Pixel Watch 1 did not get Wear OS 6 with the October update and will continue to run on Wear OS 5.1. Please be on the lookout for any future security and bug fixes for Pixel Watch 1.</p></blockquote></div><p>The quote included a link to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/12799779?hl=en">official Pixel Watch update page</a>, which confirms the October 2025 deadline for Pixel Watch 1 updates.</p><p>While the spokesperson didn't definitively say, "No," the statement suggests there won't be a second October update for the Watch 1 with Wear OS 6, and that any updates after October will be limited to security patches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We had reason to hope that the first Pixel Watch would receive a third major update. Samsung promises four years of software updates, and it has apparently confirmed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/surprise-one-ui-8-watch-update-is-reviving-this-legacy-galaxy-watch">bring One UI 8 Watch to the Galaxy Watch 4</a> in late 2025, which will be its fourth major update.</p><p>Instead, it appears that Pixel Watches will stick to two version updates and three years of security updates, with occasional security patches after the three-year window.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 1 uses an outdated Exynos 9110 chip originally used in Tizen OS Galaxy Watches. Perhaps Google didn't think Wear OS 6 could run smoothly on older hardware, even with 2GB of RAM. But when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-5">Pixel Watch 5</a> launches next year, the Watch 2 may not receive Wear OS 7 even though it shares the Watch 3's Snapdragon hardware.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-is-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-pixel-watch-4">Wear OS 6 has impressed us</a> so far with its stylish scrolling animations, revamped Tiles, dynamic color theming, custom watch faces, and other functional fixes. It's arguably the best smartwatch update Google has released, which makes it a shame that Pixel Watch 1 owners may never see it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a> launched on October 9 with Wear OS 6; based on Google's update strategy, it seems we can expect it to receive Wear OS 8 in 2027, but not Wear OS 9 in 2028.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In uncharacteristic fashion, Google made Magic Cue easily accessible, and that should allow a decent chunk of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> customers to use the feature.</p><p>What is Magic Cue, you ask? It uses machine learning to serve up contextual details. All of this is done automatically, and all you'll need to do is just use your phone as you would anyway. In my use, I found Magic Cue to be useful at pulling up order emails while talking to a brand's customer care, or location details of an event while messaging. It's things like these where it shines, and the best part is that it stays hidden away when you don't need it.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-magic-cue-2">How to set up Magic Cue</h2><p>Activating Magic Cue is about as easy as it gets:</p><ol start="1"><li>Go to your phone's Settings.</li><li>Scroll down and select the Magic Cue sub-menu.</li><li>In this page, toggle the available features to On.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4092px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.12%;"><img id="ppepPUNFze4trrJ4Ga5b7U" name="Magic Cue" alt="Magic Cue on the Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ppepPUNFze4trrJ4Ga5b7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4092" height="2992" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That's all. If you don't immediately see a difference after enabling Magic Cue, that's also by design; the feature takes a day or two to learn your usage habits, and it'll then start suggesting relevant actions. While I don't use many AI utilities on my device, I found Magic Cue to be quite handy — it saves me the hassle of digging in my mailbox, and it has been reliable in the month I used my Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><h2 id="what-data-does-magic-cue-access-2">What data does Magic Cue access?</h2><p>Magic Cue is a Pixel 10 feature, and as such it's limited to the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and Pixel 10 Pro Fold. While it shows contextual information outside of Google apps, it only pulls in data that's tied to your Google account. You can see what apps it is using to surface information, and on my Pixel 10 Pro XL, it is using Gmail, Messages, Keep, Contacts, Calendar, and Pixel Screenshots to provide actions.</p><p>Note that you have the ability to toggle data sources. Don't want Magic Cue to access your Gmail? You can disable it from the feature's settings with ease. Google notes that Magic Cue data is stored in a "secure, isolated environment" and that the data is kept private.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These days, most phone launches (at least on the Android side) are filled with how AI is going to overhaul how you use your phone.</p><p>The reality isn't quite so grand, but brands like Google and Samsung are doing a great job integrating AI-assisted features in a meaningful way on their phones. So if you got a recent phone and haven't looked into all the AI utilities yet, this post should be a good starting point.</p><p>I'm going to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> to showcase AI features on Android. While most brands have a suite of AI offerings, Samsung does the best job both with the number of features available, and how they're organized. In short, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> makes it extremely easy to see which features are actually available on your phone, and how to use them.</p><p>Google also has a strong suite of AI features, but trying to find out what's available on a device like the Pixel 10 Pro XL is like a hidden objects game — you have to constantly dig through the interface to uncover features, and if you're lucky, you'll find a few you'll end up using. Thankfully, Samsung doesn't make things anywhere as convoluted, and given that it is the biggest Android brand by a lot, its features get the most mainstream usage. With that out of the way, let's dive in.</p><h2 id="search-anything-with-google-2">Search anything with Google</h2><p>Google's Circle to Search is highly useful as it lets you search what's on your screen. It's extremely easy too; all you have to do is hold down on the navigation bar, and circle around the object you want to search. The idea is to make it easier to search; if you're scrolling through Instagram and see an interesting pair of shoes (it's basically my entire feed now), you can just draw around the object and search on Google with minimum effort. Here's how to do it:</p><ol start="1"><li>Navigate to <strong>whatever you want to search</strong>.</li><li><strong>Press down</strong> on the navigation bar (the horizontal bar at the bottom of your screen).</li><li>Draw around the <strong>object of interest</strong>.</li><li>Google automatically surfaces details.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi" name="Circle to Search" alt="Circle to Search on a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/foNgfqpV8Xrd86krKrrXNi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a nifty utility, and it's there when you want it and hidden away if you don't ever intend to use it.</p><h2 id="translate-anything-with-ease-in-real-time-2">Translate anything with ease — in real-time</h2><p>Another good use of AI is real-time translation. Samsung phones have a few ways where they leverage translation features. The one that I think is the best is Interpreter, as the name suggests, it offers real-time translation, so if you're traveling abroad or don't know the local language, you can use this to get around with ease. Using it as easy as it gets:</p><ol start="1"><li>Pull down the <strong>notification shade</strong>.</li><li>In the quick settings tiles, select <strong>Interpreter</strong>.</li><li><strong>Choose the language</strong> (you can select from over 30 languages) you want to translate, and just hit the record button.</li><li>You'll see a <strong>real-time translation</strong> into the target language you've selected, and it automatically narrates as well.</li></ol><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4380px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.53%;"><img id="7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n" name="Interpreter" alt="Interpreter in Galaxy AI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7hhqvurpqyjxHoxnQDTP7n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4380" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="edit-your-photos-the-way-you-want-2">Edit your photos the way you want</h2><p>My biggest AI-related use case is image editing. Whether it's taking out unwanted objects from the background of photos or tweaking colors, you get plenty of useful features around this area.</p><ol start="1"><li>Go to the Gallery.</li><li>Choose the image you want to edit.</li><li>Choose the AI icon (the one with the stars at the bottom of the page).</li><li>You'll see the Generative edit window, and here you can draw objects you want to erase.</li><li>Hit the Generate button.

This feature is reportedly automatic and will alert users to it via a notification on Android. According to Google, Safety Check will soon remove the permissions for notifications from websites that users don't typically interact with.</p><p>The browser will deliver the following alert: "Chrome unsubscribed you from notifications."</p><p>If there are multiple websites whose notifications have gone without interaction for a long time, the alert will tell you how many. The notification lets users say "Got it" to dismiss it, or they can "Review" it. Reviewing the alert drops you into Safety Check's menu within the browser's settings. From there, you'll see a "permissions removed from X site(s)." Users can, again, see which sites Chrome automatically revoked permissions from, and redistribute them if necessary.</p><p>The publication highlights an exception, such as Chrome on Android won't revoke notification permissions from web apps on your phone. Google states, "We’ve already been testing this feature. Our test results show a significant reduction in notification overload with only a minimal change in total notification clicks."</p><h2 id="keeping-things-clean-2">Keeping things clean</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:798px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.27%;"><img id="zjhjXf6MA5pJL5gMVeBB3i" name="google-chrome-safety-check-auto-notification-revoked" alt="A snapshot of Chrome on Android's automatic permission removal alert for notifications from websites a user rarely interacts with." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zjhjXf6MA5pJL5gMVeBB3i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="798" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company reportedly hadn't explicitly stated <em>when </em>users on Android can expect this feature to arrive. However, considering the timing of the announcement, a Friday (Oct 10), we may not see this until next week, if anything. But there's also a chance this waits until the next major Android feature drop. It also seems this update is headed for Chrome on desktop, too, per the post.</p><p>Safety Check <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chrome-safety-check-defense-boost-android">was a huge update</a> that hit Google Chrome last year, and since then, updates have continued to roll out for Android users. The most recent update that regarded notifications in Chrome <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-android-scam-spam-notification-gemini-protection">had to tap Gemini for a little help</a>. Google wanted to increase the browser's ability to ward off potential scams through notifications.

Well, there have been a ton of Galaxy S26 leaks lately, and we thought you'd want all of it in one spot! From how to watch to what we're expecting, we've got you covered right here.</p><p>This year, we expect to see a possible shuffle in the Galaxy S26 lineup with rumors about Samsung<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup"> giving up the S26 Plus variant</a> for a more premium Edge model. Other than that, we expect to see some software upgrades, possibly the Galaxy Buds 4, and of course, we're hoping to see Samsung's most hyped tri-fold device, which could launch soon in select countries.</p><h2 id="how-to-watch-the-2026-galaxy-unpacked-2">How to watch the 2026 Galaxy Unpacked</h2><p>This one seems simple and most predictable. While a lucky few journalists and influencers get to attend Samsung's Unpacked events in person, the rest of us have to make do with a live stream of the launch on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_3571213889837284912&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2F&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-unpacked-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">official website</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung" target="_blank">YouTube platforms</a>. Samsung will likely release its live stream link in the days leading up to the event, and you can click the "notify me" button to receive a heads-up before the live stream begins.</p><p>While it's too early for us to know exactly when and where the event will take place, if Samsung sticks to its usual schedule, it'll probably be in the second or third week of January. The "where" is still a secret!</p><p>So, what can we expect from the Galaxy Unpacked event, and will Samsung's new offerings level up this year? Let's "Unpack" it for you.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-pro-plus-ultra-and-edge-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro, Plus, Ultra, and Edge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung could be switching things up with its next flagship lineup, as several leaks have indicated so far. For what it's worth, it won't see a drastic shift, as it will allegedly hold onto its basic trio — the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra. We've heard chatter that Samsung could potentially rebrand the base model as the Galaxy S26 Pro.</p><p>There are also rumors of a fourth phone joining the party this year. The Galaxy S26 Edge was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">thought to replace the Plus</a>, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">recent rumors</a> suggest Samsung is now considering adding both phones to the lineup.</p><p>As for the trio's design, Samsung doesn't seem to be making drastic changes to it, at least according to the latest leaks. The devices appear to resemble their predecessors; however, they might feature a thinner profile, similar to the recent Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.  If the Korean OEM is chasing thinness, it could end up using thinner camera modules that are integrated with the rear panel, making the frame sleeker. CAD-based renders of Samsung’s upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> lineup back the fact that the Pro and Ultra models won't look different.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle" target="_blank">Galaxy S26 Edge</a> could show up with its rear panel dominated by a camera island that spans nearly the phone’s entire width, much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple" target="_blank">Apple</a>’s iPhone 17 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.93%;"><img id="unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-Edge-Leak-4" alt="A leaked render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/unZnRYwhUK29vb85wttHVZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1938" height="1084" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of cameras, the Galaxy S26 Pro would retain its predecessor's camera array. On the other hand, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might get a fresh set of lenses. Leaks suggest that there could be a larger 200MP Sony main sensor, while others suggest minimal hardware changes for the quad-camera setup with a new 200MP main, 50MP ultrawide, 10MP 3x telephoto, and 50MP 5x periscope lens.</p><p>Rumors also indicate that the new<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5"> Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 </a>chip could power phones in some regions, while others could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-might-rock-the-exynos-2600-chip-but-only-in-this-region">Exynos 2600 processor</a>. All models are rumored to feature a base of at least 12GB of RAM, with a possible jump to 16GB as an option. The series will launch with Android 16 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">Samsung's One UI 8.5.</a></p><p>As for the battery, the base version could feature a 4,300mAh battery, the Edge variant might have a larger 4,200mAh battery, and the Ultra is expected to get a massive 5,500mAh battery. S Pen fans can also breathe a sigh of relief as the phone will likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-s-pen-isnt-going-away-at-least-on-the-galaxy-s26-ultra">keep the S Pen</a>, adopt a slimmer build, and support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging">faster 60W charging</a>.</p><p>But it's important to note that these are still preliminary leaks, and all these features may not make it on the actual device. We'll know more about these flagship models in the coming months.</p><h2 id="one-ui-8-5-2">One UI 8.5</h2><p>Samsung launched the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner"> One UI 8 much earlier</a> than scheduled with its foldables this year, considering the Korean OEM usually drops major UI upgrades with its flagship devices. That said, the next lineup is said to get some major features with the rumored One UI 8.5.</p><p>On the UI front, users can expect an expanded dark theme, a forced icon theming option, lock screen widget support, and a universal cursor when using external displays. For media, Samsung is bringing in improvements like new Audio APIs, an HDR/SDR brightness slider, enhanced media router privacy, and personal audio sharing via the output switcher.</p><p>One UI 8.5 is also expected to heavily leverage AI, as the company is supposedly developing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-5-get-to-the-point-faster-ai-notification-summaries">"Notification Summaries"</a> feature that will provide quick recaps of lengthy messages and group conversations, which could be done with a simple toggle.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8iPcphrR4njNRT7omAaEZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1235px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.45%;"><img id="ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ" name="One-UI-8.5-new-features" alt="new features spotted in One UI 8.5 builds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziRCzrVZ4gM6ScLpDdykCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1235" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:270px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.22%;"><img id="8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk" name="samsung-one-ui-8-5-ai-notification-summaries" alt="Samsung is reportedly testing AI-powered notification summaries for long texts in One UI 8.5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Df6eBGKwKyGnWxt63qKrk.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="270" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:208.74%;"><img id="Czt7zRbnf8pwrcsRgT4kKX" name="One-UI-8-5-navigation-style-picker" alt="Navigation style picker in One UI 8.5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Czt7zRbnf8pwrcsRgT4kKX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="412" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What really excited us is the rumored "privacy display" feature that is allegedly in the works. This could be what makes the Galaxy S26 series' big product stand out from everything else out there right now.  We first saw mentions of this feature back in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tech.yahoo.com/phones/articles/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-shield-101906989.html">September</a>; however,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display"> just a few days ago, another tipster</a> posted screenshots showing the toggle option for this "privacy display."</p><p>As the name suggests, this feature could limit how much of your screen is visible to those standing next to you, especially when you're in a crowded area and entering your banking details on your device.</p><p>That said, this feature is said to be embedded within the workings of the new flagship.  It will automatically turn on when you're using sensitive apps — like banking, messaging, or payment services — or when the phone detects you’re in a crowded place. It will apparently use what Samsung calls "Flex Magic Pixel technology," which tweaks how pixels behave in real-time, probably with AI, to make screen content super hard to read unless you are the owner of the device.</p><p>There also seems to be multiple levels of privacy, including a “Maximum Privacy” mode that heavily dims the screen for stronger protection, and manual settings for people who prefer full control.</p><h2 id="galaxy-buds-4-2">Galaxy Buds 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Buds 4 Pro Software testing has started ‼️Build test :R640XXU0AYI1/R640XXU0AYI1 pic.twitter.com/lvSL008Srd<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1969164703273287826">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>As for the next-gen Galaxy Buds, we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">have a few leaks so far</a> that hint at their existence. Last month, a leak suggested that the Korean OEM has started naming its next buds, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds 4 Pro, using what appear to be internal code names. The test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about the alleged earbuds, with hints to base and Pro model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>Since they were found in the strings in Samsung's test server code, there's not enough information about them, so nothing on specs or features as yet. But we do know that they exist and are in the works. In another leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826" target="_blank">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>, it claims the company has also started developing the firmware for these alleged Buds 4 and 4 Pro models. We'll probably see more as we get closer to the launch, allegedly in January.</p><h2 id="galaxy-g-fold-tri-fold-2">Galaxy G Fold (Tri-fold)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi" name="Samsung Foldable OLED" alt="Samsung Foldable OLED demo panels at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yJF6kbcTg82QcDvhLffvCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has repeatedly dropped hints that it is working on a tri-fold device. Be it during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">January Unpacked</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC</a> this year. A Korean news website reported earlier this year that Samsung Electronics was working on launching the "Galaxy G Fold" and the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but that didn't happen.</p><p>We haven't seen official renders or even leaks of the Galaxy Z TriFold; however, animation videos have been popping up quite a bit. The recent one shows the device sporting a U-shaped fold, all but confirming that Samsung’s Trifold features a central cover display flanked by two panels that fold around it. The animation also shows another interesting detail about the alleged cameras on the device, which lets you shoot selfies with the main rear cameras.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1595px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold" alt="unfolded form of the Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5gcMhGUVnj4LUQKN7dWncK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1595" height="897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, it could feature a "newly developed display and film." Other alleged specifications are that the device's main internal display will be around 9.96 inches, and the external display will be 6.49 inches, which is slightly larger than the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally" target="_blank">Huawei</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huaweis-tri-fold-mate-xt-puts-all-other-foldables-to-shame-and-its-now-available-globally"> Mate XT.</a></p><p>In terms of design, it is said to sport a titanium frame, 16GB of RAM, and a Snapdragon chipset, and without a doubt, it will come with a hefty price tag.</p><p>More recently, a "person familiar with the company's plans" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">told CNN that the U.S.</a> has been a part of their launch discussions. Samsung was rumored to launch its Trifold phone first only in South Korea, before expanding it across other regions based on how the phone fares in the domestic market. However, it might be switching things up with the Trifold by launching it simultaneously in both its home market and the U.S., rather than staggering the release.</p><p>However, it's unclear if a U.S. launch will happen at the same time, if at all. A staggered release could happen, which means we'd have to wait a bit longer to see the Trifold stateside, possibly during the Galaxy S26 launch.

But this leak from Android Headlines just leaked every single detail of the headset, including its UI. According to several images posted on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xr" target="_blank">website</a>, the alleged VR headset will have six cameras on the front and two lenses internally.</p><p>Several sensors will be fitted around the front of the device to make sure the device detects gestures and eye movements. Additionally, the leak claims that the headset will have microphones and speakers, advanced enough to detect the difference between the user's speech and someone speaking to them.</p><p>The leak claims that this headset will run on "One UI XR," which sounds like a skin of Android XR. The screenshots posted by the publication show apps like Camera, Gallery, Google Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Netflix, and more.</p><h2 id="wear-os-6-finally-lands-on-older-pixel-watches-2">Wear OS 6 finally lands on older Pixel Watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EaPHnRCfooBcNtH78pHgoG" name="Wear-OS-6-scroll" alt="A GIF showing the Pixel Watch 4 app drawer with a finger scrolling it up and down, revealing the "List View" Edge button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaPHnRCfooBcNtH78pHgoG.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="338" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-major-wear-os-6-upgrade-rolls-out-for-the-pixel-watch-3-2"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Older Pixel Watch models got a much-needed upgrade OS-wise this week.

The most recent tease shows the OS in action, calling it "smooth." The company demonstrates that the UI is much more fluid and fast for swiping between applications and menus. OnePlus says, "Move through your screen like playing your favorite tune."</p><p>In the clip, the model is swiping their finger across several OnePlus devices, all with their background apps screens open. The OS seems incredibly swift, without any visible lag or hitch, though it is just a teaser clip. However, just from this brief glimpse, OxygenOS 16 seems to resemble <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/apple">Apple</a>'s iOS.</p><p>In a subsequent clip, the company demonstrates how users can easily pull and expand their folder previews on their home screen, creating small, circular folders to save space or folders that can stretch horizontally and expand to more boxy shapes.

The X200 Ultra continues to deliver the best cameras of any phone I used this year, and the X200 Pro is still my go-to choice when it comes to daily use.</p><p>If anything, Vivo is now my favorite Android brand, and I enjoy using Funtouch OS over other Chinese skins. It's a good thing, then, that Vivo introduced a small phone to take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>. The X200 FE comes with a smaller 6.31-inch panel, and it doesn't have much in the way of similarities to the regular X200 or X200 Pro — it has a distinct identity, and it looks great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSvvEPhDGfAnAuF6kKQvjQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo still doesn't sell its phones outside Southeast Asian markets, and as a result, the X200 FE is limited to select regions. The good news is that it is available in India, where it currently costs ₹54,999 ($620) for the 12GB/256GB model. That's in line with what the OnePlus 13s costs in the country as well, so there isn't much to differentiate either device in that regard.</p><h2 id="clean-design-with-usability-in-mind-2">Clean design with usability in mind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gnfDKBvVGVoLXFdPLwWkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the design of the X200 FE. The phone has flat sides, but they're comfortable to hold and use, and at 186g, it isn't anywhere as heavy as the X200 Pro. In fact, it is a smidgen thinner than the 13s as well, and the in-hand feel is one of the reasons why I enjoy using this device so much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GnNMEY5VJ2wofXhLq8rihQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnNMEY5VJ2wofXhLq8rihQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I got the Frost Blue color of the device, but the Amber Yellow is the variant to get if you need a device that grabs attention immediately. The frosted glass finish at the back ensures it's easy to hold, and the mid-frame gets a matte texture. If anything, the X200 FE is better than the X200 Pro when it comes to usability, and I'm guessing that was the point.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4966px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="XVMzoTAQUkLGW8FPm9WddQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XVMzoTAQUkLGW8FPm9WddQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4966" height="2797" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5017px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="7AzSv4QunGJqGbaV3bc7dQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7AzSv4QunGJqGbaV3bc7dQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5017" height="2826" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="e8LMuMWJh4CaYvhVQgTqcQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8LMuMWJh4CaYvhVQgTqcQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="oKjhnJrASjCHamieorEtfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oKjhnJrASjCHamieorEtfQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Vivo did a good job in this regard, and the build quality is rock-solid — not that this was an issue on any Vivo phone in recent years. And just like the regular X200 models, the X200 FE gets IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance. Now, I haven't tried shooting jets of hot water at any of these phones with IP69 ingress protection, so I'll have Vivo's word that the phone withstands pressurized jets up to 80 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5172px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eVWPomyqUpYpfyEi6bqNfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5172" height="2913" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only issue I have with the design is the camera island at the back; the oblong design meshes well with the overall aesthetic, but the island protrudes from the body, and makes the X200 FE wobble quite a bit when using it on a table. Of course, it isn't anywhere as extreme as the Galaxy Z Fold 7, but this just wasn't an issue on the X200 or X200 Pro because of the massive camera modules on those devices. Vivo should have retained a similar design at least, albeit a smidgen smaller.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-you-need-2">The hardware you need</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4961px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCnVJQbaqoYakeEwUnKStQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4961" height="2794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo knows what it's doing with the hardware, and there isn't much to talk about in this area. The 6.31-inch AMOLED panel has good color vibrancy and contrast levels, and you get the same level of customization as the other X200 devices. It has the Shield Glass that Vivo has been using for a while instead of Corning's Gorilla Glass solution, and it has proven to be reliable in my usage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pdVp3qFyUusf6B5E7k5VkQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I had the X200 FE for just over two months now, and in that time, the phone took a few tumbles thankfully, it came away unscathed each time. The panel gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming along with the usual 120Hz refresh, and it is fluid — just like other Vivo phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wrMC4i8jG8t6Nc7vUJMseQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4939" height="2782" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In short, there are no issues with the smaller-sized panel. It may not have the real estate of the X200 Pro, but it's just as good to play games on, and it gets bright in outdoor use. On that note, the Dimensity 9300+ platform powering the phone is a known quantity, and it does a good job handling visually-demanding games. I would have liked the same Dimensity 9400 as the rest of the X200 range, but the older platform still has a lot to offer.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7njJ6okK2ceWpkQcAWsdbQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My main annoyance in this area is that Vivo is using UFS 3.1 storage modules; while I get that the X200 FE doesn't cost as much as its siblings, even mid-range phones are now coming with UFS 4.0, so I don't really understand why the brand didn't use those modules. Thankfully, there's 12GB of RAM as standard, and the 512GB model I'm using comes with 16GB of memory.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4807px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ToZC6RwSbrouPHWRBXvLdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4807" height="2708" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X200 FE gets a 50MP main lens alongside a 50MP 3x tele and 8MP wide-angle, and honestly, it does a fabulous job taking photos.

Vivo somehow managed to slot in a huge 6,500mAh battery in the phone, and it is even bigger than what you get on the X200 Pro. The result is that the X200 FE lasts two days between charges, and even after pushing the phone, I comfortably got a day and a half.</p><p>Battery anxiety is a thing of the past on Android — unless you're using the S25 Edge. Other than that outlier, any phone should last a day with relative ease, and I didn't have to worry about the battery running out before the end of the day on any of the 50 or so devices I tested this year. If anything, the only device that was problematic in this area is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, but that's an entirely different entity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ" name="Vivo X200 FE" alt="Vivo X200 FE review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHtJEu3ZkTHDNuoEzSC8qQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the X200 FE, you don't need to worry about the battery whatsoever. It takes an hour to charge even with the bundled 90W charger, but that's not a problem at all.

The post suggests that Samsung has been pushing ahead with its SF2 process, otherwise known as the 2nm process for an SoC.</p><p>According to its source, Samsung has given Qualcomm "samples" of its 2nm technology for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.</p><p>This would, essentially, become a "For Galaxy" chip that's using Samsung's technology, instead of purely Qualcomm's 3nm. However, there's a rumor that the overclocked chip could find a home in the Galaxy Z Flip 8 next year. This reportedly comes from a rumor that Samsung is "internally considering" producing the boosted Snapdragon chip within its Foundry for its foldable.</p><p>The publication speculates that this could be due to a potential partnership between TSMC and the Samsung Foundry to get this completed. We're in a bit of a no man's land with these rumors, as a previous report tells a different story.</p><h2 id="the-flip-8-and-the-galaxy-s26-2">The Flip 8... and the Galaxy S26?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 Different Colors hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EDViSRgQkr6UKcF7r9wHA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There were rumors about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-true-snapdragon-8-elite-2-2nm-process-qualcomm-chip-rumor">a new "For Galaxy" chip</a> in the air; however, that was during the summer and only mentioned the Galaxy S26 series. Those rumors said that Qualcomm was looking to get Samsung to create a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 2 alternative using its 2nm process. Qualcomm would continue to provide the chip using the 3nm process to all other OEMs.</p><p>This chip, which would be "For Galaxy," an overclocked version, would only concern the Galaxy S26 series next year. There was some hope around this rumor, as Samsung reportedly achieved ~30% production yield early on. This has been echoed recently with today's South Korean report.</p><p>It's unclear just where we're going following the latest rumor. Whether Samsung brings its 2nm Snapdragon variant to <em>both </em>series remains the sole question. It would be nice if the Flip 8 would see it, considering the Flip 7 had to settle for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-benchmarked-exynos-2500">Exynos 2500</a>.</p><p>The idea of Samsung working with Qualcomm to create 2nm chips takes us back again to a 2024 rumor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tsmc-qualcomm-2nm-chip">that such a reality could unfold</a>. Qualcomm was also reportedly interested in tapping TSMC to do the same.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With an industry-leading audio profile, active noise cancellation, and fast charging via the USB-C cable, these headphones have just about everything you could ask for in a modern pair of Bluetooth headphones. They also feature multi-point connection, eight built-in mics for clear calls and access to voice commands, and they feature an easy to use mobile app for optimal customization options.</p><p>Although Sony has a newer-gen version of these headphones in the WH-1000XM6s, they're pretty pricey and these will boast pretty similar hardware. All that to say, the WH-1000XM5 headphones are still some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> out there, and especially with an extra 25% discount on their normal purchase price.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6" name="Sony-WH-1000XM5-render-with-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rdySiDNHum7Zj77MVRogz6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5/dp/B0BXYCS74H" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$298.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is currently offering the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones for $100 off, marking a 25% overall discount and bringing them down to under $300. To be sure, we've seen this deal before and, we're likely to see it again.

They also feature eight built-in microphones for voice assistants and phone calls, and they offer USB-C fast charging that will restore around 3 hours of playback time per 3-minute charge, according to Sony.</p><p>Users can also utilize touch controls on the headphones to manage playback, volume, and phone calls, while the Sony Connect app lets users access EQ settings, sound modes, 360-degree audio, and more.</p><p>The Sony WH-1000XM6s come with 12 microphones, instead of eight, and they also feature upgraded drivers for even better audio quality. However, it's also worth noting that they retail for $450, and you won't see them getting big discounts like this WH-1000XM5 deal very often.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But after Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold put the rest of the market on notice, the same can be said about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, but for a completely different reason.</p><p>We've lamented on numerous occasions about how the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was an eyesore and behind the 8-ball as soon as it arrived. It was awkward, had thick bezels, and a hinge that may or may not have opened all the way. It made the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> look futuristic, despite using a design that was already getting a bit long in the tooth.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-fold-hinges-2" alt="Google Pixel Fold vs. Pixel 10 Pro Fold hinges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DyuViJDrBfrwwH4rMZLJHW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google then surprised us all with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, managing to beat out the rest in the race to become as thin as possible. Fast forward to now, and Google has "recycled" this design for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, skipping the "thin" factor in favor of other specs, such as a larger battery and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Qi2 magnetic charging</a>. However, there's another reason why the added thickness doesn't bother me, and it's one we probably don't think about enough.</p><h2 id="where-the-pixel-10-pro-fold-stands-apart-2">Where the Pixel 10 Pro Fold stands apart</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hinge-schematics-design-hero" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold design schematics lifestyle image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fSdhd6NaRgHxEMHyKeUSoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's one thing that Google's flagship foldable has over the rest of the competition: an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof">IP68 rating</a>. Frankly, many wondered if such a rating would ever apply to foldables, given the numerous fail points on a phone with a built-in hinge. Not to mention that Google was the first to achieve this, not Samsung, Oppo, Xiaomi, or any other phone maker.</p><p>In doing so, it provides me (and hopefully everyone else) with a bit more confidence when I get caught in a thunderstorm or take a trip with the family to the beach. No, I'm not saying you should drop the 10 Pro Fold into a bucket of water to test it, but you also won't have to worry quite as much compared to others.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW" name="pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 with Oppo Find N5 and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FqjZHrLV5RZGMdaYe8vaDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially, I didn't really think much about the IP rating, mainly because I'm almost never in a situation that would require me to worry about it. However, funnily enough, that all changed recently when I went to a three-day music festival at the beach.</p><p>Being who I am — a nerd who likes phones and tech — I went to the festival with three different phones. Two were foldables, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> in one front pocket, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> in the back pocket, and the non-folding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> in the other front pocket.</p><p>Day one of the concert festival went off without a hitch, but day two was a completely different story</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP" name="good-charlotte-sum-41-pixel-10-pro-1" alt="Good Charlotte and Sum 41 at concert taken on Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3Dd8wTxXBUjvGs6XzjpGEP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="2295" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was raining off and on all day, and it got worse after my wife and I arrived. We were there to see a few different bands, but the headliner for night two was Good Charlotte, a band that we both love and haven't had the opportunity to see. The problem was that by the time they came on stage, it felt like we were standing in the outer bands of a hurricane with heavy rain and winds.</p><p>Naturally, when you're someone like me, carrying three phones and seeing bands you listened to religiously growing up, you want to take pictures. Throw in the fact that Good Charlotte had a surprise guest in Deryck Whibley of Sum 41, and it's even more of a reason to record a video or take some pictures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-10-pro-galaxy-z-fold-7-oppo-find-n5-1" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5, and Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKqiVPdfvjMmzaMb7VPxBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Not once did I reach for either the Find N5 or the Z Fold 7 out of fear that the conditions might overwhelm them. Instead, I relied on the Pixel 10 Pro to snap pictures of the band as they played through the hits of my childhood. All the while, jumping around and dancing in a downpour that just so happened to let up as soon as Good Charlotte's time was up.</p><p>That hesitation was enough to make me wish that I had the 10 Pro Fold with me, as I would've felt just as comfortable using that over the other two foldables in my pockets. Not only could I have written about that experience, but I also would've been more likely to leave all of the other phones behind and just carry that one.</p><h2 id="compromises-for-the-sake-of-compromises-2">Compromises for the sake of compromises</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-galaxy-z-fold-7-magic-v5-oppo-find-n5-game-boy" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Honor Magic V5, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5 stacked next to original Game Boy DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XKsPPcTYiN3ThWNJL3ktFW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The thing with foldable phones is that they represent the epitome of compromise within the smartphone space. Companies try to cram as much tech as they can into phones that aren't just simple slabs of aluminum and glass, usually to the detriment of one feature or another. It's why the Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't have the same camera hardware as the 10 Pro XL, despite the former being about $800 less expensive.</p><p>This idea of compromise is also why Samsung ultimately decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">ditch S Pen support</a> with the Fold 7, as the digitizer prevented Samsung from making the phone as thin as it wanted. And while I think there's a prototype out there that looks like the Fold 7 but includes the necessary tech to support the S Pen, I suspect that it'll never see the light of day.</p><p>Honestly, I don't even know if I would care at all about the IP68 rating if it weren't for my concert experience. But if anything, it's made me realize that it's time for Samsung, Motorola, and every other foldable phone maker to get on board. Even if that means that the phone is a few millimeters thicker than the current models.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c0ff7ead-c155-4f70-920a-41130f9bd6f5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHw8obrqbC2rRRZUMSq77i.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Jade"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><strong>Don't sleep on it</strong></p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold might not be the thinnest foldable, but Google is relying on other major changes to lead the way, even if they aren't immediately noticeable.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

We love them because it's a cost-effective and convenient way to break the barrier of not understanding what we see or hear around us.</p><p>With the ability to use devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">smartphones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones" target="_blank">earbuds</a> to understand what we see and hear, this technology is within the reach of almost everyone. This allows us to overlook many of the obvious issues of using AI to translate what one person is saying into what another person is hearing.</p><p>AI struggles with the subtle aspects of human language. All cultures use things like sarcasm or humor, along with specific cultural references that can easily confuse a machine (and sometimes even a human). Phrases like "<em>kick the bucket</em>" or "<em>Skibidi Rizz"</em> simply can't be accurately translated without understanding the meaning and context the speaker had in mind.</p><p>There is also still a perceptible amount of lag. We call it real-time translation, and it is very fast and impressive, but using "chunk detection" to guess when a person is done speaking often leads to awkward pauses or even misinterpretations.</p><p>Finally, there is the issue of bias. AI "learns" from the data it collects, which reflects numerous gender, race, and accent biases. This leads to AI doing things like using male pronouns for a doctor while using female pronouns for a nurse. Other bias issues are more apparent; when most of the data collected comes from males aged 18-40, things can have a specific outlook that ignores many cultural aspects, as well as alternative points of view.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="56LZiGRL7mdXgFsChVFU67" name="Gemini-replaces-Assitant" alt="Hello Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/56LZiGRL7mdXgFsChVFU67.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1300" height="731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>AI Translation is not a Human Replacement.</strong> Experts and users alike generally agree that human translators are still needed for important situations such as legal or medical contexts. A machine can't have the same cultural understanding and empathy as a human, either.</p><p>AI translation is best viewed as a powerful tool that <em>augments</em> human capabilities, not replaces them. Even as the science and theory behind it all improve, there are things AI can never be capable of doing as well as real flesh and bone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

What’s immediately drawing attention is just how thin this device appears to be. Multiple reports suggest the Edge 70 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/leaked-moto-edge-70-video-new-entry-to-the-thin-phone-squad">could measure less than 6mm</a>, making it one of the slimmest smartphones on the market.</p><p>Even with its slim design, Motorola appears to be keeping performance in mind. According to the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.motorola.com/pl/pl/unlock-the-future" target="_blank">teaser</a>, the Edge 70 will include a 4,800mAh silicon-carbon battery, which offers better energy density than standard lithium-ion batteries. This battery is much larger than those found in other ultra-thin phones, such as Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and Apple’s iPhone Air.</p><p>The phone will also support 68W wired fast charging and 15W wireless charging, which should make battery anxiety a thing of the past. Under the hood, the Edge 70 is expected to run on the Snapdragon 7 Gen 4 chip, backed by up to 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage. On the software side, it will reportedly ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> right out of the box.</p><h2 id="vibrant-visuals-2">Vibrant visuals</h2><p>Display-wise, leaks mention a 6.67-inch P-OLED panel with a 2712 x 1220 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Photography fans can expect a dual 50MP rear camera setup, with the main lens offering optical image stabilization.</p><p>The phone is also said to have IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance, Gorilla Glass i7 protection, and an AI-powered button on the side for smart shortcuts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="auPAQnMw9Haea2tkhFU6dA" name="Moto-Edge-70-render-leak-01" alt="Moto Edge 70 leaked render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/auPAQnMw9Haea2tkhFU6dA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola is also leaning into design flair with Pantone-certified color options, including Bronze Green, Gadget Gray, and Lily Pad, giving the phone a more premium aesthetic. Early retailer listings suggest the device will be priced somewhere between €799 and €899, though some leaks hint at a lower €690 starting price in select regions.</p><p>The main appeal of the Motorola Edge 70 may be its balance of style and performance. If the 4,800 mAh silicon-carbon battery lives up to expectations, Motorola could raise the bar for ultra-thin smartphones. We’ll find out more at the official launch on November 5, but for now, the Edge 70 stands out as one of Motorola’s most promising designs in recent years.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In the video's description box, the user states the Pixel 10 Pro is suffering from an issue within Google's Camera API. The user states they were trying to figure out why their videos always stuttered/jittered when recording, and it seems it's not the camera's fault, but Google's software.</p><p>It's worth noting that these jitters are incredibly noticeable when filming at 5x, and ever-still at 2x. It's no shock that we have micro movements and whatnot when filming or photographing.</p><p>Instead of minimizing those movements, the EIS (electronic image stabilization) is reportedly consistently failing at that zoom range.</p><p>The user couldn't find a solid fix until they downloaded a free app with its own stabilizing capabilities. It is a third-party app, so exercise caution. The video shows the comparison, expanding on how jittery <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">the Pixel 10 Pro's</a> camera is, even with EIS that's supposed to take all of that away. At the moment, there's no concrete fix for this as the phone's EIS is software-based through the Camera API.</p><p>The user did try to record using the wide-angle lens at 0.5x zoom, and that seemed to be better than anything else. They add that using "VideoBoost" only minimizes the jitterness slightly when recording.</p><h2 id="more-bugs-to-patch-2">More bugs to patch</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-camera-viewfinder-exposure-app-2" alt="Exposure settings in the Pixel 10 Pro camera app viewfinder" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saeDocqSHrFEqkKj6WVmg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2024" height="1139" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the publication also assumes, Google will likely (hopefully) see more reports and begin working on a fix that could arrive next month during its monthly security patch.</p><p>There have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-a-small-pixel-camera-9-7-patch-update">Pixel Camera fixes</a> rolled out this year, but an issue like this is something the company should have on its radar to fix as soon as possible.

One of its biggest advantages over other foldables is IP68 dust and water resistance, made possible by a redesigned hinge mechanism. Google has now explained what went into creating this new hinge.</p><p>The hinge is the most important (and vulnerable) part of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>. It's relatively easy for Android OEMs to make regular smartphones sleeker and more durable since they have no moving parts, but a foldable phone is a different story. Its two halves constantly move, relying on a hinge to keep everything working smoothly.</p><p>Most foldable smartphones use a hinge design with tiny gears inside. However, Sangsoo Park, an industrial designer at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-gearless-hinge-design/">explained in a blog post</a> that these gears often cause problems over time. "They can be damaged and dust can get stuck between them," he said, which can lead to a degraded opening and closing experience.</p><p>That's why Google opted for a "gearless hinge" in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Park noted that typical hinges use four gears to allow the two halves to rotate symmetrically as the device opens and closes, but Google replaced those with a more advanced mechanical component called CAMs. This new approach helped save internal space and improve reliability.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-pro-fold-s-hinge-uses-cams-instead-of-traditional-gears-2">Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge uses CAMs instead of traditional gears</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NjKXaA2ajYV3ARhff6rqTD" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-impressions-7" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Pixel Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NjKXaA2ajYV3ARhff6rqTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google claims this new hinge of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is more reliable and will "continue to work flawlessly over time," which is especially important for a premium device with long-term software support.

The leak claims that the headset weighs only 545 grams.</p><p>Additionally, in the front, the headset will be equipped with sensors under the glass,  that is said to detect gestures and eye movement. "The ones in the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners are for hand tracking, and two round sensors at the bottom of the headset, next to the nose cutout, will pick up on your hand gestures."  Another "depth sensor" is located close to the user's forehead, which will supposedly help gauge your surroundings.</p><p>Furthermore, the device could showcase four eye-tracking cameras that use infrared LEDs and AI to track the user's pupils "at all times."  The images show that the headset features two top buttons: a volume control and a "Top button." This launches apps and the UI, or long-pressed, accesses Google Gemini.</p><p>The headset's bottom seems to feature air vents, various sensors (including hand movement), and multiple microphones that will be advanced enough to detect the difference between the user's speech and someone speaking to them.</p><p>The headset will supposedly come with two controllers, with 6 DoF and analog sticks. It will also have haptic feedback for accurate 3D movement tracking and enhanced immersion.</p><h2 id="one-ui-for-xr-2">One UI for XR</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.19%;"><img id="GT5UoBVzRLa7jAFeCZpF8C" name="Samsung-XR-hreadset-leak-UI" alt="One UI XR on Samsung's VR Headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:27,l:245,cw:1392,ch:783,q:80/GT5UoBVzRLa7jAFeCZpF8C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leak claims that this headset will run on "One UI XR." The screenshots posted by the publication show some Camera, Gallery, Google Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Netflix, and more. It seems from the screenshots that users will be able to customize some icons that they need handy above the larger list of applications, as seen in the "top menu, which has home, Google, and Gemini, with other icons for controls.</p><p>As for its specs, the website states that the headset will feature a 4K micro-OLED display across two screens. Powered by a Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 processor, it will allegedly support spatial audio, gestures, AI, and tracking. Navigation is via a right-stem touchpad (long tap to recenter, double-tap for VR/Pass-Through modes) and a left-side power connector for a brick battery. It offers 2.5 hours of video playback and 2 hours of general use, with spatial audio via 2-way speakers (woofer and tweeter) on each side.</p><p>While this is an incredibly detailed leak, it should be taken with a grain of salt.

TeamGroup now has a new external SSD dubbed the PD20, and it's designed to look similar to traditional portable SSDs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4TgopfEgfuEb9emyKnXVHh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4TgopfEgfuEb9emyKnXVHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It has similar dimensions as Seagate's One Touch SSD, and weighs just 22g — it's small and light enough that you can take it anywhere.

That's broadly similar to what you'd pay for most portable SSDs, and the advantage with the PD20 is that you get a 2,000MB/s bandwidth — double that of Samsung's T7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7govZ7b8EwzpZydEBL6WHh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7govZ7b8EwzpZydEBL6WHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TeamGroup also has a generous five-year standard warranty, and I like that about the brand. Okay, let's talk about the SSD itself. The PD20 is designed to be portable, and it fits into a pocket with ease. The hanging hole design means you can attach it to your bag, and the aluminum chassis is designed to be durable. The PD20 gets a pre-installed silicone case as an added source of protection, and it doubles as a cover for the USB-C port.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="L3PYor37J8sWTuTRRSHrEh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L3PYor37J8sWTuTRRSHrEh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The PD20 is clearly built to last; I used it for the better part of four months, and it's pristine. I have no doubt that it will hold up just as well in long-term use as the X1 Max and other external SSDs I have. It gets IP54 dust and water resistance as well (provided the USB-C cover is closed), so it should weather any spills without issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="p6MEJP9Gvmxy5PCJ6TSqLh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6MEJP9Gvmxy5PCJ6TSqLh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A big selling point of the PD20 is that it connects via the USB 3.2 Gen2x2 standard, offering double the bandwidth of most external SSDs. I used Crucial's X10 Pro quite a bit in the last two years, and like the PD20, that drive also uses the same standard, and the only downside is that not all Windows machines can leverage the additional bandwidth.</p><p>TeamGroup touts 2,000MB/s bandwidth, and in my testing, I saw reads of 1,800MB/s and writes of 1,630MB/s, with the drive outmatching the X10 Pro. Basically, outside of LaCie's rugged drives, the PD20 is the fastest SSD I tested, and it doesn't cost anywhere as much. In fact, it is at the lower end of the scale when it comes to Gen 2x2 SSDs, and that alone makes it worthy of consideration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YFSsVPafGugmG5AWCCPBEh" name="TeamGroup PD20 Mini" alt="TeamGroup PD20 Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YFSsVPafGugmG5AWCCPBEh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I would have liked a built-in USB-C cable as I tend to lose these tiny cables that are bundled with the drive, but other than that, I didn't see any issues with the PD20.

If Samsung does add native Qi2 support, there's a possibility of losing the reverse wireless charging feature, like with the Pixel 10 series.</p></article></section><h2 id="is-not-having-native-qi2-charging-on-the-galaxy-s26-a-deal-breaker-2">Is not having native Qi2 charging on the Galaxy S26 a deal-breaker?</h2><p>Magnetic wireless charging using the Qi2 standard on Android phones has gotten trendy only this year, thanks to a lot of hype drummed up by companies like Samsung and Google. This is essentially the same tech that Apple introduced back in 2020 with the launch of the iPhone 12 series. Of course, charging speeds have gotten better since it debuted, but not all Qi2 phones are built the same.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26</a> will most certainly support Qi2 charging, just like the S25 series, but we don't know if this implementation will be native. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">Galaxy S25 supports the Qi 2.1.0 standard</a> that lets it charge up to 15W wirelessly, but magnetic charging is only possible with a case. It's only the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi 2.2 standard</a> or Qi 25W that allows for a maximum charging rate of 25W. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> is the only phone in the series to support this, while the rest of the Pixel 10 series support the older Qi 2.0 standard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">An early release Google Pixel 10 Pro XL case with a Qi2 magnet array inside.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's too early to tell what Qi2 standard will be used in the Galaxy S26; we can only hope it's the latest one that allows for much faster charging. Whether the magnets will be built in or not is still anyone's guess, but given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">Pixel 10's support for magnetic charging</a>, it seems likely. Still, if you plan on using a case with the Galaxy S26 anyway, then you can simply slap on a case to use with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a>. If you're worried about the case adding extra bulk, we're sure there will be options for slim cases with Qi2 magnets as well.</p><p>One reason you might not want built-in magnets in the Galaxy S26 is the possibility of losing the reverse wireless charging feature. The Pixel 10 series had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-goodbye-reverse-charging">this feature removed </a>due to the built-in magnets, although this isn't necessarily a rule, given how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-qi2-launch">HMD Skyline</a> has both native Qi2 and reverse wireless charging.</p><p>Samsung seems to be mindful of what its users want, as it recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-asks-users-sacrifice-thin-phonesbuilt-in-qi2-magnets-survey">conducted a survey</a> asking them if they'd be okay trading slimness for built-in Qi2 magnets. It's feedback like this that led them to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">remove Bluetooth functionality</a> from the Galaxy S25 Ultra's S Pen since it found less than 1% of users actually used Air Actions. It's safe to say that if Samsung sees an overwhelming demand for built-in magnets, we might just see it on the Galaxy S26.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung's Galaxy S26 phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>. </em></p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="8c2a629f-a292-4ec2-bdd2-d1d13b5e60c5">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best compact flagship</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 is currently one of the best small flagships that you can easily buy anywhere in the world.

That said, it's not hard to guess when it might happen, as we have a few years of launches to refer back to.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-release-date">Galaxy S25 launch</a> took place on January 22, 2025, in San Jose, CA. The Galaxy S24 launch occurred the previous year, roughly one week prior on January 17, 2024. Given this trend, we can guess that the Galaxy S26 is likely to be revealed sometime in the latter half of January. Since the last launches occurred on Wednesdays, it seems like a safe bet to expect January 21, 2026, for the official reveal; however, the date, time, and location remain unknown.</p><p>Samsung is expected to announce the official launch date in early January to generate hype for its upcoming devices, so we'll keep an eye out.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 release date</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S26-lineup" alt="CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup including the Ultra and Pro models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xjB8J3TW4uEYHxikamyM6d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Alleged CAD renders of the Galaxy S26 lineup. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S26 release date is likely to occur weeks after the phones are revealed. This gives consumers time to preorder the phones and any accessories they may want, while providing Samsung with invaluable preliminary data on which devices are more popular and may require increased production, as well as those that may not.</p><p>For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a> was released on February 7, 2025, just over two weeks after the official announcement. Therefore, we can expect a similar timeline for the Galaxy S26, with a release date in the ballpark of February 6 (assuming a January 21 launch).</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-preorder-deals-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 preorder deals</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5HJfqRe5YQejgnUedVGnPd" name="Samsung-ready-for-mooore-teaser.jpg" alt="Samsung's Galaxy S23 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5HJfqRe5YQejgnUedVGnPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ahead of the Galaxy S26 Unpacked launch event, Samsung will likely open reservations for its upcoming devices. Anyone interested can simply sign up to reserve a device, and doing so will provide them with a discount when preorders open.</p><p>There's no commitment to reserving a Galaxy S26, so you're not obligated to preorder the device. However, it's always more beneficial to do so in case you want to buy it and receive a credit that you can put towards the phone or accessories.</p><p>Samsung and participating carriers will likely offer additional preorder deals after the phone launches, such as a free storage upgrade or accessory bundles. Some of these offers may require trade-ins, new lines of service, or other prerequisites; however, we'll be sure to highlight the best Galaxy S26 preorder deals when they become available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the rumored design of the Galaxy Trifold is briefly seen in the patent, the real revelation is that Samsung could utilize three batteries, not two. The Dutch publication notes that the patent mentions a battery called "360," which is simply a moniker.</p><p>However, that singular "battery" is actually broken up into three parts in the leaked patents.</p><p>The patent suggests Samsung will place a battery that contains a portion of the phone's overall capacity in each panel. These are broken down into battery numbers 361 (T1), 362 (T2), and 363 (T3). Per the leaked document, T1 seems to be the smallest battery, as Samsung could have that inside the rear panel, right under the vertical camera array.</p><p>For T2, that battery is shown in the center of the main display when opened. It seems that T2 is the largest of them, as T3, placed in the cover display, is between them all in size. It's not a "strange" change, considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> has a split battery, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>, Samsung's future competition, features one battery, too. Though that battery is quite thin as it is. However, this could be because Samsung wants to raise its battery capacity while maintaining as thin a frame as possible.</p><p>Rumors allege the Galaxy Trifold could rock a 5,000mAh battery capacity or higher, and this could be how it gets it done.</p><h2 id="samsung-enters-the-chat-2">Samsung enters the chat</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:90.91%;"><img id="6AprWjDShJL7tpQ4qwFdWV" name="samsung-galaxy-trifold-three-battery-leaked-patent" alt="A leaked patent alleging that the Samsung Galaxy Trifold could feature three batteries, one in each panel, for a higher capacity." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6AprWjDShJL7tpQ4qwFdWV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="660" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Kipris)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been hearing rumors—waiting, too—for Samsung's first Trifold, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">that seems to finally be a possibility</a> this year. A report in September claimed Samsung was looking at a potential simultaneous launch of its Galaxy Trifold that would bring the phone to its South Korean and U.S. consumers. The device is rumored to feature a U-shape hinge design to further enhance its longevity and protect its displays.</p><p>Moreover, a titanium frame could help create a little more durable device. The Trifold's alleged internal specs state we could see 16GB of RAM. A few reports, even some from this summer, said the device was going to launch during a September Unpacked, but that never happened. Instead, the phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-summit-2025-surprised-crowds-samsung-xr-headset-showcase">now been rumored</a> to launch with Samsung's XR headset in October.</p><p>As far as some more exciting features, an animation leak concerned the Trifold, showing off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-trifold-wants-to-be-tablet-pc-in-leaked-animations">the purported multitasking power</a> of the phone. It looks like Samsung really wants to appeal to those looking to get work done, or chill out with a game and YouTube videos at the same time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For that reason, it's worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Smartphone-Unlocked-Processor-Manufacturer-Whitesilver/dp/B0DP3GP92Z" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon is still offering the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for 28% off</strong>,</a> even after the official Prime Day sale has ended.</p><p>The S25 Ultra is our favorite premium Android phone on the market, in no small part due to its powerful performance, its suite of cameras, the vibrant AMOLED display, and the inclusion of the S Pen stylus. Battery life is also a key factor here, with the large battery pack making it easy to get more than a day's worth of battery per charge. As for cameras, the phone boasts a wide and ultrawide lens, a 3x and 5x telephoto lens, a 12MP front camera, and a wide range of AI and other features.</p><p>While the S25 Ultra normally retails at $1,300, the current discount brings that price tag down to just $935, so it's definitely a deal worth considering if you've already had your eyes on a premium phone.

One of the most recent teaser clips is all about speed. More specifically, the company is teasing how its OS has become much more fluid and fast for swiping between applications and menus. OnePlus says, "Move through your screen like playing your favorite tune."</p><p>In the clip, the model is swiping their finger across several OnePlus devices, all with their background apps screens open. The OS seems incredibly smooth, without any visible lag or hitch, though it is just a teaser clip. However, just from this brief glimpse, OxygenOS 16 seems to resemble Apple's iOS more and more, and that continues in another clip.</p><p>The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@oneplus/post/DPigXtAiAif">next teaser</a>, while it still talks about how smooth the OS will be, highlights the user's ability to "play it your way." The clip briefly shows off how users will be able to easily pull and expand their folder previews on their home screen, creating small, circular folders to save space, or folders that can stretch horizontally and expand to more boxy shapes. AI was the other side of its teasers today, which will arrive to be "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@oneplus/post/DPeBbzhkoqE">Intelligently Yours</a>."</p><h2 id="oxygenos-16-is-on-the-way-like-the-oneplus-15-2">OxygenOS 16 is on the way, like the OnePlus 15</h2><div class="instagram-embed"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned  data-instgrm-version="6" style="width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);"><p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPlIWLkkr0F/" target="_blank">A post shared by OnePlus (@oneplus)</a></p><p>A photo posted by  on </p></blockquote></div><p>OnePlus states OxygenOS 16's AI "adapts to your personality," pushing the new software to become the most "intelligent, personal system" to come from the OEM. The company teases that its AI will "celebrate" the user's "uniqueness, while also bringing cross-device connectivity.</p><p>With so many teasers, OnePlus confirms that its next major OS upgrade will arrive on October 16.</p><p>Yes, we have an all-new OS to look forward to from OnePlus, but there's something we're forgetting: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/first-official-look-at-the-oneplus-15s-square-camera-bump-ahead-of-early-us-launch">the OnePlus 15</a>, which was shown off at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit.

The phone's been redesigned, as it now features a vertical, almost square camera design.</p><p>The phone is suspected to arrive in the U.S. a little earlier than usual, rocking the new OxygenOS 16 in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Craning your neck down at a 6-inch rectangle simply doesn't fit any definition of the term. But one game developer is hell-bent on turning that little black rectangle into a portal that defies expectations.</p><p>Waltz of the Wizard might not be a name you're familiar with unless you own a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> (or an older headset). It's a classic VR title that's been around for a long time but has seen regular updates over the years, often injecting impressive levels of innovation into a seemingly simple formula.</p><p>The game has enjoyed a huge revival over the last year thanks to social media, and developer Aldin Dynamics is launching the first mobile version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waltz-of-the-wizard/id6742191553">on iOS</a> at the end of this month. Yes, I know, it's more than a bummer that it's not available on Android yet, but it's still an impressive way to take a VR game and make it available for a significantly larger audience of gamers to try.</p><h2 id="bash-some-skullies-2">Bash some Skullies</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pt6iFWRfoWQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>After toying around with the game for quite a while, I knew I had to chat with the developers to find out how they ported a VR game so successfully to a mobile platform. After all, Waltz of the Wizard deeply relies on both physical and voice immersion to drive the experience, but it turns out the pace of the game allows this to translate to mobile quite seamlessly.</p><p>Hrafn Thorisson, the co-founder and CEO of Aldin Dynamics, told me the company has always been about "making realities that make you feel like this isn't a game." For Aldin, this means adding a "high degree of interactivity to characters, thousands of reactions for them," and, maybe most notably, "speaking to them verbally by using your voice."</p><p>That last part is something not often seen in the world of smartphone gaming, unless we're talking about having a chat between friends on Discord while simultaneously playing a game. Waltz of the Wizard almost completely revolves around a disembodied human skull named Skully, whom you talk to constantly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mc2JAjpynFRNZBza7GffaQ" name="waltz-of-the-wizard-official-screenshot-03" alt="An official screenshot of Waltz of the Wizard for mobile showing Skully being held over a wizard's pot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mc2JAjpynFRNZBza7GffaQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aldin Dynamics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether it's asking about the properties of an object in the world and what you can do with it, or even asking Skully to conjure up some magic to create items, this sarcastic, borderline rude skull is the key to Waltz of the Wizard's unique personality as a game.</p><p>Unlike some other VR games that have started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/stellar-cafe-job-simulator-hands-on">experimenting with LLM robots</a> to create unique dialogue, Waltz of the Wizard uses a more "classic AI model," as Thorisson puts it. Skully is built to react to things in a specific, hand-hewn way that has required developers thousands of hours to build, complete with a fully-voiced personality.</p><p>Thorisson says Skully is "the most interactive character you'll have on mobile now," with "thousands of thousands of reactions" for you to find. Whether that means bashing him against the wall a few times or feeding him some weird potion you just concocted is entirely up to you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7sjAcqf9weu863UjZW3mXk" name="waltz-of-the-wizard-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Dropping an eyeball into a pot using mixed reality mode on an iPhone in Waltz of the Wizard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7sjAcqf9weu863UjZW3mXk.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="225" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Translating the interactivity component of the VR classic to a mobile touchscreen interface was a better fit than a traditional console. "In some ways, we're able to do things with a mobile device that we can't do with a console, where the standard is to have buttons and joysticks." Plus, being able to utilize the natural "drag and drop" nature of a touchscreen meant the interaction paradigm fit better on a phone than a console.</p><p>Phones also have the added advantage of a front-facing camera and built-in microphones, which allow Skully to not only hear you, but also see you making facial expressions. Make an angry face or wink at him, and he'll probably notice.</p><p>Furthermore, Aldin Dynamics is utilizing the rear camera on the phone in a way I've ever seen before: using your physical hand to interact with the virtual world. Some of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-casual-meta-quest-games">my favorite casual Meta Quest games</a> use hand tracking for simplicity, but Aldin is using it here for something unique in the smartphone world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rcg3U5Cd6sj3vUEWEuGdUQ" name="waltz-of-the-wizard-official-screenshot-02" alt="An official screenshot of Waltz of the Wizard for mobile showing Skully next to a sign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcg3U5Cd6sj3vUEWEuGdUQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Aldin Dynamics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thorisson stresses that this mode is "not exactly like a fully fledged mode yet" and Aldin Dynamics is using feedback to further polish the experience, but he hopes this gives "people a taste of what VR is like."</p><p>There's nothing quite like using your own hand to interact with a game, which is something VR is typically uniquely built to handle. This becomes quite clear as you play around with the mobile game's mixed reality mode, as it doesn't always track your hand perfectly and often doesn't nail interactions like the VR version.</p><p>However, Aldin's quest to deliver a VR game on a mobile platform is surprisingly successful, based on the hours I've put into Waltz of the Wizard on mobile so far, and the experience is impressively full and immersive, despite the relatively small screen. Keep an eye out for Waltz of the Wizard on iOS devices later this month, and hopefully, we'll see the magic land on other Android devices in the near future.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="66bd4884-8832-4de4-b999-f96f00b7fdf0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Meta Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Whether you love social environments, puzzle game, multiplayer shooters, or just checking out the next evolution of technology, the Meta Quest 3s has it all at a lower price than you imagined.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, Samsung is supposedly preparing to launch a beta period for its 8.5 OS software later this year. Rumors suggest that this beta program could start arriving for Galaxy phones late next month, on the week of November 24.</p><p>It's unclear if this beta program will begin for users in the U.S., Europe, and other regions, as it likely would (if true) for South Korea. If anything, other regions would see a gradual rollout at the end of November, rolling over into December.</p><p>It's suspected that Samsung's current wave of devices with One UI 8 will see this One UI 8.5 beta.

It was during that time that tipsters had allegedly found Samsung's early test build for One UI 8.5 on its internal test servers. The company was reportedly testing the software using its Galaxy S25 series, though One UI 8.5 isn't expected to roll out until the Galaxy S26 launches.</p><p>The root of the matter is that there was very little to unpack, as the software had only just appeared.

The platform is the successor to Google Agentspace, which lives on spiritually as one small part of the Gemini Enterprise experience.</p><p>Google explains that there are six core parts of Gemini Enterprise: an agent creation and orchestration mechanism (derived from Agentspace), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">new Gemini models</a>, starter AI agents, integration with company data sources, centralized security and granular permission settings, and an ecosystem of partners. Together, these parts aim to help Gemini Enterprise offer a simplified, code-free experience that employees at all skill levels and in all fields can use.</p><p>Beyond the existing set of available Google AI models, Gemini Enterprise workspaces will now get access to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">better known as nano banana</a>. Other perks include the latest Gemini Code Assist agent, which pairs with two existing core agents for Gemini Enterprise. Looking ahead, Google Cloud is readying a Data Science Agent and Customer Engagement Suite Agent to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-cloud-is-adding-six-new-ai-agents-for-devs-scientists-and-power-users">round out the set of pre-built AI agents available</a>.</p><p>Gemini Enterprise is arriving globally where Google Cloud services are offered, and there are Gemini Enterprise Standard, Gemini Enterprise Plus, and Gemini Business. The latter will be available in the coming weeks, and with a price starting at $21 per seat, per month, it's ideal for small businesses and startups. Meanwhile, the Standard and Plus plans start at $30 per seat, per month and intended for larger companies.</p><h2 id="how-google-cloud-is-streamlining-company-workflows-with-gemini-enterprise-2">How Google Cloud is streamlining company workflows with Gemini Enterprise</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fGt4EMiqr6RespcmXs64RQ" name="Gemini-Enterprise-2" alt="The Gemini Enterprise branding and sample imagery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fGt4EMiqr6RespcmXs64RQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini Enterprise is trying to streamline how companies approach AI usage by offering a jack-of-all-trades solution. There are no-code, low-code, and manually-coded systems for the creation and usage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">custom AI agents</a>, which is ideal for flexibility. The company says Gemini Enterprise can be used by any employee in any department as a result, from IT workers to frontline and retail staff.</p><p>The platform can be built to match a company's individual needs, much like Agentspace. Gemini Enterprise supports integrations with top workspace ecosystems like Microsoft 365 and Salesforce. The data within these ecosystems give Gemini models and custom AI agents the context it needs to accurately assist with queries or automate tasks.</p><p>Gemini Enterprise Standard and Plus plans specifically meet the strict security and privacy needs of larger corporations, with customizable permissions. Ahead of the launch, Google Cloud announced partnerships with major brands — Figma, GAP, Gordon Foods, Klarna, Macquarie Bank, Melexis, Signal Iduna, Valiuz, and Virgin Voyages — that are deploying Gemini Enterprise in their workplaces.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Similar to what it did in July, the Pixel 6 series is missing from this month's security update. The October patch is instead rolling out for the Pixel 7 series up through the Pixel 10 (Tablet and Folds included). The Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 series will see update vBP3A.251005.004.B1.</p><p>Users with a Pixel 10 series model will find update vBD3A.251005.003.W3, while the Pixel Tablet grabs vBP3A.251005.004.<strong>A2</strong>.</p><p>The patch notes this month aren't as extensive as the ones from September; however, there's one persistent issue Google is still grappling with: display problems. The post states the update is rolling out a fix for "screen flickering and sudden shutdown." This fix is specific to the Pixel 7, 7 Pro, and 7a. Another display-related problem, one where some users experienced a "frozen or fuzzy" display, is being patched.</p><p>This fix concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-google-pixel-10-is-eerily-similar-to-the-iphone-and-thats-the-point">Pixel 10, 10 Pro, and 10 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>Regarding its system, Google says it's fixing "system instability" for the Pixel Tablet. The remainder of the fixes are as follows:</p><ul><li>Fix for an issue where a semi-transparent background would persist after the camera was launched under certain conditions</li><li>Fix for issue where the flashlight status does not appear on the At a Glance widget in certain conditions</li><li>Fix for System UI crash when starting or stopping casting with the Media Output Switcher in certain conditions</li></ul><h2 id="the-google-pixel-2">The Google Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3b9naa6TqePWe7JznpjduU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-10" alt="Holding a white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL in front of red flowers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3b9naa6TqePWe7JznpjduU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has been working on display issues for its Pixel devices for a while now, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-september-security-update-pixels-slides-fixes-for-the-whole-series">patch from September</a> addressed one problem for the Pixel 10. The latest flagship series was suffering from a black screen during transitions, per user reports. This problem occurred during transitions from webpages in an in-app browser. That problem was reportedly fixed, as well as a few camera issues for the Pixel 8 and 9 series.</p><p>Android users were also treated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-september-update-brings-music-sharing-and-personalized-android-bots">to a huge drop last month</a>, a drop that brought LE Audio Auracast for synchronized listening.

The company states it expects these new stores to be completed and ready for consumers by the end of the year.</p><p>For this expansion, Samsung's executive vice president of the mobile experience, Dave Das, said, "Samsung Experience Stores are designed to meet consumers where they are — in their towns, near their work, and where they shop." On that note, Samsung highlights that its Experience Stores are there to help potential (or pre-existing) Galaxy users understand the products they see.</p><p>The post states consumers visiting an Experience Store can go hands-on with Samsung's ecosystem of products and view Galaxy AI demonstrations.</p><p>The Galaxy Experts on staff at the Experience Stores will answer customer questions or guide them through the store's "Endless Aisle."

Coming from a Motorola Razr, it was novel to use a phone with a 3.5-inch touchscreen and a built-in app store. Following the 3GS, I switched over to Android (I got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-nexus-4-review">Nexus 4</a>), but I started using iPhones again a few years later — as my secondary phone — starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.</p><p>These days, I get to use every mainstream phone that launches globally (and a few that don't). Over 80 phones cross my desk in any given year, and I got to use the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> this year.</p><p>Out of all those devices, it's the iPhone Air that stood out the most. It isn't the most innovative phone I used — that honor goes to the tri-folding Mate XT — but the ultra-sleek design of the Air is just plain cool. Photos don't really do this thing justice; you'll need to hold it in your hand to understand just how thin and light it is.</p><h2 id="you-ll-need-to-hold-it-to-believe-it-2">You'll need to hold it to believe it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oh498WrgHimCA2ZHTFGGSR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5149" height="2900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had the iPhone Air for ten days now, and it's become one of my favorite phones of 2025. In fact, I don't think there was any other iPhone in the last 15 years that evoked such strong feelings. The iPhone Air isn't unique in being an ultra-thin device — Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge also catering to a similar niche. But the iPhone Air is even thinner, and it just feels better to hold and use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DzBUqeYCoEFgdtTaNxGVQR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Design is obviously the biggest selling point of the Air, and the phone has a great in-hand feel. The frosted glass finish at the back also makes a difference in this regard, and you get the same set of buttons as the iPhone 17 Pro. The phone isn't anywhere as fragile as I initially imagined, and that should bode well for long-term use. While the iPhone 17 Pro switched over to aluminum, the Air retains a titanium chassis.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5058px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9EraZVsBAFxTDdzJjw6yMR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EraZVsBAFxTDdzJjw6yMR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5058" height="2849" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NrytMs7DPPTayGkvuG75PR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrytMs7DPPTayGkvuG75PR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ai6JBACguMAUdH6KG8s3TR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ai6JBACguMAUdH6KG8s3TR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x2wipy7e2FW9rABhyFeMHR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x2wipy7e2FW9rABhyFeMHR.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The iPhone Air has a 6.5-inch OLED screen with LTPO tech, and it is the exact same panel used in the iPhone 17 Pro, albeit a little bigger. You get the same great color vibrancy and excellent contrast, and it holds up incredibly well under harsh sunlight thanks to the anti-reflective coating. It has ProMotion tech, so you get 120Hz refresh as standard, with the panel going down to 1Hz with static content.</p><h2 id="pro-grade-internals-2">Pro-grade internals</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uYLcyfvV7UfdT9KGCLFaTR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uYLcyfvV7UfdT9KGCLFaTR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You don't miss out on the internals either, with the iPhone Air coming with the latest A19 Pro silicon. The situation with the modem is interesting; Apple is using the C1X modem — a derivative of the C1 that debuted on the iPhone 16e — in the device, and it handles 5G connectivity alongside Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 6.0. The iPhone Air differs from the Pro models in this regard, with those devices using the N1 chip along with a Qualcomm cellular modem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dbU8ynJ2xEsxNF5zNtRCWR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another point of differentiation is that the iPhone Air is only available with eSIM — there's no model with a physical SIM card slot. Apple says it did this to maximize internal storage for the battery, and honestly, it isn't as limiting as I thought. I have a secondary number that I ported over to an eSIM, and it has been smooth setting it up on the Air.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LkdaW4f9PU5SiQebpdpjUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LkdaW4f9PU5SiQebpdpjUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, we need to talk about the battery. The iPhone Air comes with a 3,149mAh battery, and while it is decent in the context of iPhones, it doesn't last all day in my use. I had to top it up around evening time with a power bank (I'm partial to UGREEN's Nexode 165W power bank with a retractable cable), and while it isn't an issue when I'm home, I wouldn't want to take the iPhone Air while traveling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5C9DSMUcCEWh6qggMepULR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5C9DSMUcCEWh6qggMepULR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Battery anxiety is not a thing these days, with most phones managing to last a day without any problem. Most Android phones like the Vivo X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro last a day and a half even with heavy use thanks to 6,000mAh batteries, but even the iPhone 17 Pro manages to last a day consistently. However, the thinner size of the iPhone Air precludes it from doing so, and if you're a heavy user like me, you will be plugging it in before the end of the day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GMC65pyRhP6nhCdqdigLUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GMC65pyRhP6nhCdqdigLUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another consideration is the camera; the iPhone Air has a single 48MP camera at the back, and it takes good photos and videos. It may not be at the same level as Android flagships, but it delivers images with good colors and dynamic range, and it holds its own in low-light situations. The problems is the lack of auxiliary cameras; I use the 2x and 3x lenses regularly, and I often rely on these modules to shoot portrait shots. Not having the ability to do that on the Air is limiting.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jywgAtGNT9FP42ovs3T8dR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jywgAtGNT9FP42ovs3T8dR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the front 18MP camera is the same as the iPhone 17 Pro, and it is fantastic. It uses a square module and switches orientation on the fly, so if you end up taking a lot of selfies, there's a lot to like here. The software is similarly identical to the Pro models, and I like the new visual design.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-for-everyone-and-that-s-okay-2">It's not for everyone— and that's okay</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR" name="iPhone Air" alt="iPhone Air on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ug94ZK8FKYyyEaSpBPojUR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the iPhone Air isn't meant for everyone. There are always going to be tradeoffs in a new product line, and with the iPhone Air, those include a single camera and average battery life. I've been carrying an iPhone alongside my Android phone for several years now, so the fact that the iPhone Air doesn't last as long doesn't bother me anywhere as much.</p><p>But if you're eyeing this as an upgrade to your existing iPhone, you'll need to factor in the downsides before purchasing it. If you routinely take photos and videos and need added versatility, you should just get the iPhone 17 Pro. But if you don't mind the single camera and are willing to deal with the average battery life, then the Air is a much more enticing option than the mainline iPhone 17.</p><p>The iPhone Air isn't designed to the best iPhone — it isn't even the best iPhone I used in the last two weeks — but it is my favorite.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="05116724-061f-4532-8224-6bb19d6f1f50">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fmPbGHUfnJhg6TM3t6ypnW.jpg' alt="The iPhone Air in Cloud White against a white background."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Apple iPhone Air</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>An ultra-sleek design combined with powerful internals makes the iPhone Air one of the most exciting iPhones in a long time. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

I enjoyed using the Amp Pro, but I wanted to switch to the Amp Ultra for two reasons: increased power delivery, and the built-in 3.5-inch panel.</p><p>The Amp Ultra <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Streaming-Amplifier-ES9039Q2M-Touchscreen/dp/B0F995W2NG">costs $529 on Amazon</a>, a $150 increase from the Amp Pro. While both amps share a similar design, the Amp Ultra is bigger and heavier, and the inclusion of the screen is a welcome addition. What I like the most about WiiM's products is how straightforward they are to set up and use, and this is the same with the Amp Ultra as well — you'll just need to connect the amp to a wall outlet, and use the WiiM Home app to configure it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="88dgPqzTi3KVqQNZk5fJdL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/88dgPqzTi3KVqQNZk5fJdL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like all WiiM products, the build quality of the Amp Ultra is terrific; it has a minimalist design with belies its price tag, and the aluminum construction is decidedly high-end. It does a good job with heat management as well, and there's a rotary knob at the front to control the volume.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mEuck5WWdr7HXkMEuPYbVL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mEuck5WWdr7HXkMEuPYbVL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I generally like the design of all WiiM products, but the Amp Ultra looks more upmarket than its siblings. It's clear that WiiM paid a lot of attention to the design, and it's safe to say that there are few amps that look as good — particularly in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5ZtqmqEw5sPoHrhEgVj9FL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ZtqmqEw5sPoHrhEgVj9FL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The built-in 3.5-inch panel makes it easy to control music playback and view album art, and WiiM bundles its new Voice Remote 2 with the product, which is what I used to predominantly control the Amp Ultra in the two months I used it. I paired the Amp Ultra with Wharfedale's Linton, and the amp is easily able to drive the speakers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2Gg3gKGVCZLNpAyuCYprEL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2Gg3gKGVCZLNpAyuCYprEL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to the hardware, the Amp Ultra has an ESS 9039Q2M Sabre DAC along with TI OPA1612 op-amps and two TI TPA3255 amps. It delivers 192kHz/24-bit audio, and connects to just about every streaming protocol you can think of: Chromecast Audio, Spotify Connect, Tidal Connect, DLNA, and Roon Ready. It's the Roon integration that I like the most; I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/roon-has-transformed-how-i-listen-to-music">use Roon to play music</a> on all the connected devices in my house, and it's a fabulous platform. Being able to access it on the device makes it all the more convenient.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="i3XJTX2WuJEBxAWKfLkk9L" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i3XJTX2WuJEBxAWKfLkk9L.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, WiiM Home has a clean interface, ties into all mainstream music services, and has plenty of customizability along with granular 10-band EQ control. What I like is that you get the ability to adjust EQ individually for each source mode, which is pretty great. You can do everything from adjusting the brightness of the built-in panel, which clock faces to use, standby time, adjust settings of a connected subwoofer, and so much more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5j2eYrquQvVqtHhzr4VNcL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5j2eYrquQvVqtHhzr4VNcL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to connectivity, you get the standard gold-plated binding posts that let you hook up speakers, and there's a dedicated subwoofer out. The inputs include optical and RCA, along with HDMI ARC; this is another reason why I used the Amp Ultra, as HDMI ARC allows me to connect the amp to my TV.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TGw7bFw2bg4kG8Aey9DUyK" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TGw7bFw2bg4kG8Aey9DUyK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can use two WiiM amps to set up a Dolby 5.1 system, and while I'm using it just with the Linton, I'm eager to use a home theater configuration in this way. Elsewhere, there's Bluetooth 5.3 (to pair with the remote), Wi-Fi 6, and an Ethernet port. The bundled remote has all the buttons I need (including a dedicated mute button), and like the amp, it has a metallic design. It connects over Bluetooth, charges via USB-C, and has four programmable preset buttons. The only quibble I have with it is that the buttons aren't backlit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ygXjfF8cnGnNdBBioRfnPL" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ygXjfF8cnGnNdBBioRfnPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With 100W a channel at 8Ω and 200W at 4Ω, the amp has more than enough power to drive demanding speakers. It's able to drive the Linton with ease, and the sound quality is phenomenal. Granted, I'm just getting started with home audio, so I don't have much in the way of a reference point, but I'll be picking up Denon's AVR-X3800H shortly, and I'll test how WiiM's offering holds up against that.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rWBmpMgKiTw2fEmUmYXGxK" name="WiiM Amp Ultra" alt="WiiM Amp Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rWBmpMgKiTw2fEmUmYXGxK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another feature the Amp Ultra gets is automatic room correction. The brand's RoomFit feature does a great job tuning the acoustics based on the size of your room, and it worked very well with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. If anything, the only feature missing on the amp is AirPlay 2, it's unclear why it isn't available, but it isn't as big a limitation in my own use.</p><p>Outside of that, the Amp Ultra has proven to be a standout streaming amplifier, and it manages to look good while doing it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="477a580a-90f6-46a7-857d-dddbe5c42f37">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Streaming-Amplifier-ES9039Q2M-Touchscreen/dp/B0F995W2NG" data-model-name="WiiM Amp Ultra" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:62.50%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AV3gCpyJv2F2WpKdVDJS7i.jpg' alt="WiiM Amp Ultra"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">WiiM Amp Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Amp Ultra has enough power to drive demanding audio gear, and it has unmatched connectivity.

The Venu 4 is also slightly less comfortable to wear, and while you can offset the weight gap with a nylon strap or the smaller 41mm model, you're still getting a much smaller display in exchange for a lower price and a more traditional watch look.</p><p>We've already broken down the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu 3</a> generational gap; now, let's compare the Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1 to help you decide which exclusive features you'll truly care about.</p><div ><table><caption>Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 4</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu X1</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Case colors</p></td><td  ><p>Slate, Silver, Lunar Gold (41mm only)</p></td><td  ><p>Black with Slate Titanium, Moss with Titanium</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Materials</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless steel and fiber-reinforced polymer case, steel bezel</p></td><td  ><p>Fiber-reinforced polymer with titanium caseback, no bezel</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Strap</p></td><td  ><p>22mm or 18mm silicone Quick Release strap</p></td><td  ><p>24mm Nylon ComfortFit Quick Release strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5ATM, Gorilla Glass 3</p></td><td  ><p>5 ATM, sapphire crystal</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>45 x 45 x 12.5mm, 56g w/ strap</p><p>41 x 41 x 12mm, 46g w/ strap</p></td><td  ><p>41 x 46 x 7.9mm, 40g with nylon strap</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Buttons</p></td><td  ><p>2</p></td><td  ><p>2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch (390x390) or 1.4-inch (454x454) AMOLED touchscreen, 2,000 nits</p></td><td  ><p>2-inch (448 x 486) AMOLED touchscreen, 2,000 nits</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Tracking</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, QZSS, SatIQ, All-Systems GNSS + Multi-Band</p></td><td  ><p>GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BeiDou, QZSS, All-Systems GNSS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, ECG, gyroscope, skin temperature</p></td><td  ><p>Elevate v5 HRM, SpO2, accelerometer, altimeter, compass, gyroscope, skin temperature</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, ANT+, Wi-Fi, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>✔️ 8GB (Music)</p></td><td  ><p>✔️ 32GB (Maps, music)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mic & speaker</p></td><td  ><p>✔️ (Calling, Phone commands, Watch commands)</p></td><td  ><p>✔️ (Calling, Phone commands, Watch commands)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Flashlight</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td><td  ><p>✔️</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p><strong>45mm: </strong>12 days (4 w/ AOD), 20 GPS hours, 19 All-Systems GNSS hours, 18 multi-band GPS hours, 9 hours All-Systems GNSS w/ music</p><p><strong>41mm: </strong>10 days (3 w/ AOD), 15 GPS hours, 13 All-Systems GNSS hours, 12 multi-band GPS hours, 6 hours All-Systems GNSS w/ music</p></td><td  ><p>8 days; 2 w/ AOD, 16 GPS hours, 14 All-systems GNSS hours, 7 hours All-Systems GNSS w/ music</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-x1-what-s-the-same-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1: What's the same?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-compass" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 worn on a wrist showing the ABC app with a compass, altimeter, and barometer data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Npegq62CU6WNjxjmPsjvzB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-4-makes-major-changes-to-garmins-health-and-fitness-coaching-and-were-intrigued">Garmin Venu 4</a> and Venu X1 have two buttons — unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>'s three buttons — making them more touch-dependent than the five-button Garmin Fenixes, Forerunners, or Instincts.</p><p>They both utilize the fifth-generation Elevate sensor suite, which has remained unchanged since 2023.

The 45mm model is closer, and you can buy a nylon strap to try to close the weight gap a bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8190px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-workout-activity-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on an athlete's wrist, showing a Run activity start screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdEHDac7U4xw7fhTFhBetR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8190" height="4607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that makes the Venu 4 heavier is the stainless steel built into both the bezel and the case, giving it a classy look. The Venu 4 45mm is slightly thicker than its predecessor at 12.5mm, and looks bulky compared to the Venu X1, but it's skinnier than most other Garmin watches. It's all relative, in other words.</p><p>The Venu X1 has a titanium caseback and buttons that add some shine, but the body itself is mostly made of polymer, keeping it light. Its skinniness and textured lines around its edge make the Venu X1 look less "cheap" and sportier than thicker, polymer-case Garmin watches, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-2" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole with fairway rough in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eKy3YsTFL9sqaVKkkwrWiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the 2-inch display that's the real Venu X1 standout. It may not have the Venu 4's accessibility features, but the display leaves room to expand widgets and increase text size, so it's cumulatively much more readable. Maps, in particular, look fantastic on the X1, making it fun to use while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/ive-returned-to-golf-after-15-years-and-my-garmin-venu-x1-has-been-a-huge-help">on the golf course</a> and hiking.</p><p>The other X1 advantage is that it uses sapphire glass for the best scratch protection, while the Venu 4 sticks to Gorilla Glass 3. It's a telltale example of Garmin preventing its "mid-range" watches from getting the best features, even though almost any other $500+ watch has sapphire glass or its equivalent.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-x1-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu X1: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise processors, but the Venu 4 and X1 have comparable speed in our testing. Likewise, the mic, speakers, flashlight, connectivity standards, and sensors are mostly the same, along with the same five global navigation satellite systems (GNSS).</p><p>The first difference is that the Venu 4 offers the same dual-band (L1 + L5 signal) GPS as other top Garmin watches, as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.garmin.com/en-US/?faq=wgKpMjTlpV29AQB5PVvTL9">SatIQ</a> mode, which defaults to GPS-only to save battery but switches to better system(s) if the signal is disrupted. The Venu X1 may be the only Garmin watch this expensive to stick to All-Systems GNSS, likely due to limited space and battery life; it still does quite well for accuracy, but the Venu 4 is a better fit if you often work out in urban canyons or mountain forest regions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-glances-battery" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on the author's wrist, showing the current battery percentage (49%) and time left (1 day) in AOD mode, along with glances for Weather and Sunset below." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kDFVYm2E9SoCSDxecEgPcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next, the Venu 4 offers ECGs to detect atrial fibrillation issues, while the Venu X1 does not. Again, this has to do with the X1's unique design, as Garmin's ECG solution relies on a metal ring and a button design that it was too thin (and square) to accommodate. Keep in mind that no Garmin watches have passive irregular heart rhythm detection; you have to actively check.</p><p>The third key difference, of course, is battery life. Depending on whether you choose the Venu 4 41mm or 45mm, it'll last 2 or 4 days longer than the Venu X1, or 1 or 2 days more with AOD. In terms of workouts, the 45mm Venu 4 is rated to last four hours longer in All-Systems mode, while the 41mm Venu is rated for one hour less.</p><p>The gap isn't as wide as it might have been, as the Venu 3 lasts longer than the Venu 4; the 2,000-nit display boost cuts into its capacity. Still, even if the Venu 4 isn't as long-lived as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, it's closer to the Garmin standard you're used to.</p><h2

It's an unconventional design for Garmin, but you might be surprised how much you'll love how light it is and how it makes the dense Garmin UI easier to read, both during and after workouts.</p><p>Neither watch is especially affordable, but the Venu 4 is still the better all-around pick if you don't need maps, while the Venu X1 is the ritzy pick for someone willing to pay extra for niche perks and fantastic comfort.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="509dcf34-f733-4baa-a8e9-0984d6a4b35b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3egxn4mWgBFBcAPJYaZ6uC.jpg' alt="Render of the black 45mm Garmin Venu 4, the display showing Lifestyle logging menu with options like Late Caffeine and Alcohol."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu 4</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Garmin's best mid-ranger</strong></em></p><p>Choose the Garmin Venu 4 for a well-rounded software experience with Forerunner tools restricted from the Venu 3, with new perks like a flashlight and Fitness Coach mixed in with old favorites like ECGs and a mic & speaker.

The sound quality is quite good, and the bass in particular is vibrant. You're getting a good overall value as well.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong> You want easy-to-use controls. The touch-based controls on the HD-360 Pro are annoying to use. It isn't easily portable, so you'll need to account that in.</p><p>Most Bluetooth speakers have a plastic chassis, but the HD-360 Pro uses an aluminum body with a fabric layer and plastic up top. As such, it is considerably heavier than most other 360-degree speakers, coming in at 5lb. The lack of a carrying handle makes things harder when it comes to portability; I just carried it around by holding the slots around the radiators.</p><p>The only other issue is the controls at the top; instead of physical controls, Treblab went with a touch alternative, and it just as isn't as straightforward. Most of the time, I had to press the play/pause button a few times to trigger the action.</p><p>Other than that, I didn't have any issues with the HD-360 Pro. You're buying this for the sound quality, and that's where it excels. It delivers up to 90W of sound, and the 360-degree orientation of the drivers along with the radiators leads to a booming sound that belies its size. It is a bit bass-heavy, but not so much that it bleeds into the rest of the frequencies.</p><p>Battery life is good too, and I got over 16 hours of use without any issues. It has IPX4 ingress protection, and it connected to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a> over Bluetooth 5.0 with ease. The main reason for choosing the HD-360 Pro over other options is the value, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TREBLAB-High-Performance-Radiators-Subwoofer-Bluetooth/dp/B0D4DMNWK4">deal bringing it down to $127</a>, it's a good choice if you're looking to get a new speaker.</p><h2

The F4-424 Max looks much better than its predecessors, but that isn't the reason why it stands out — that has to do with the hardware.</p><p>The F4-424 Max is a beast of a NAS, and it is powered by the 10-core Intel Core i5 1235U platform. That's joined by 8GB of RAM, two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports, and four drive bays in addition to dual M.2 slots. Basically, this is the most powerful NAS server in its class, and TerraMaster's TOS 6 software is much better than previous years. The F4-424 Max usually retails for $899, but it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://Core i5 1235U">now down to $629</a> — its lowest price.

The F4-424 Max has everything you need in a high-end Plex server, and the fact that there are two 10 Gigabit Ethernet ports shows just how powerful this thing is.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want the best software.</p><p>The F4-424 Max is a terrific Plex server; thanks to the powerful Intel hardware and built-in transcoding, it does a great job with 4K transcodes and just about anything else. The TOS 6 software may not be the best you get in this category, but it is much better than earlier iterations, and you get a lot of useful features alongside a modern design.</p><p>Ultimately, if you want a powerful 4-bay NAS server to host Plex and store your photos, videos, and other data with relative ease, the F4-424 Max is a standout choice. The dual 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity is the real differentiator, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">now that

Cuktech is quickly establishing itself as a brand to watch thanks to its GaN chargers and power banks, and having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/cuktech-15-ultra-20000mah-power-bank-huge-potential">15 Ultra</a> for the better part of 2025, it's become clear that the brand has a lot of potential.</p><p>Like UGREEN's power banks, the 15 Ultra has a vertical design that makes it easier to carry around, and it has a 20,000mAh battery, a built-in panel that shows real-time charging details, and three ports — two USB-C and a USB-A port. It works on the USB PD 3.1 protocol and goes up to 140W, allowing it to charge your MacBook with ease. The best part is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CUKTECH-20000mAh-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0DM1RGZHD/">it's now down to $67</a>, undercutting its immediate rivals.</p><h2 id="charge-anything-anywhere-2">Charge anything anywhere</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="4065b8ec-44bb-471b-9c58-9e4d4f176b08" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="I like the Cuktech 15 Ultra; it has a design that's inherently portable, it charges at 140W and comes with a decent-sized 20,000mAh battery, and the built-in panel shows real-time charging info.

The vertical design is easy to take anywhere, and it does a good job charging all of your devices — including MacBooks.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a bigger battery.</p><p>The biggest differentiator with the 15 Ultra is that it goes up to 140W over a single USB-C port. This makes it good enough to charge MacBooks, and in my use, it proved to be great in this regard. I tested it with over a dozen phones and plenty of accessories, and it consistently delivered reliable speeds.</p><p>That's what you need in a power bank, and you also get two USB-C ports alongside USB-A, giving you the ability to charge three devices at once. The built-in panel is a nice touch, and I don't use power banks without this utility. Build quality itself is good, and I didn't see any issues in this area even with long-term use.</p><p>Overall, Cuktech did a great job with the 15 Ultra, and if you're looking to buy a new power bank, you should get it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/CUKTECH-20000mAh-Charger-Charging-Compatible/dp/B0DM1RGZHD/">while it's still down to $67</a>.</p><h2

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The funny thing about tablets is that I was a fan of the form factor long before I made a living writing about them. I usually gravitate towards the flagship models, but I can also appreciate when a cheap tablet offers a well-rounded experience, bringing us to Amazon's Fire HD 10 tablet.</p><p>To be fair, I think the Fire HD 10 is a tough pill to swallow at its $139.99 retail price, but as the latest Prime Day comes to a close, I noticed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BHZT5S12"><strong>that it's still on sale for 50% off</strong></a>. That brings the price down to just $70, and I don't know if there's a better tablet that you can get at that price. But you'll want to move quickly as there's not much time left before the deal expires.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$139.99" data-dimension48="$139.99" data-dimension25="$" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Fp3XuMq4Wwc2fLFGsYdJtY" name="fire-hd-10-tablet.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fp3XuMq4Wwc2fLFGsYdJtY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 10:</strong> <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$139.99" data-dimension48="$139.99" data-dimension25="$"><del>$139.99</del> <strong>$69.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>It's not the most powerful tablet out there, but the Amazon Fire HD 10 does a pretty darn good job at checking a lot of boxes. And at 50% off, it makes an "okay" device look really enticing.<a class="view-deal button" href="" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="66872d8d-5d6a-453b-8561-4c24a84943fd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$139.99" data-dimension48="$139.99" data-dimension25="$">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You're on a budget and don't care about anything but saving money and having a way to consume as much Amazon content as you can. Or you're entrenched in the Amazon ecosystem and want a cheap way to replicate the Google Pixel Tablet experience.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't want to deal with Amazon constantly trying to get you to use its services, and you don't want to spend the time to get the Google Play Store running. It's also not the greatest option for those who want a powerful Android tablet to use for more than just watching shows or reading books.</p><p>Although it's running Amazon's tweaked version of Android, that's probably not much of an issue for a lot of people out there. It gives you quick and easy access to all of your Amazon services, while the Amazon App Store lets you download and install apps and games. And if you <em>really</em> wanted to, there are ways to install third-party launchers and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-sideload-android-apps-amazon-fire-tablet">Google Play Store</a>, provided that you have the time and patience to do so.</p><p>The biggest downside to Amazon's lineup of tablets is that they're traditionally much less powerful compared to some of our other favorite cheap Android tablets. That said, the latest Fire HD 10 is about 25% faster than its predecessor while being equipped with 3GB of RAM and up to 64GB of expandable storage. Oh, and it's rated to last for up to 13 hours on a single charge, which is one of the benefits of using a chip that's optimized for this device.</p><p>At its core, the Fire HD 10 is essentially just a media consumption device, whether it be for books, TV shows, movies, or whatever else you want. It does have the added benefit of doubling as a smart home hub, so long as you are using smart devices within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-device">Amazon Alexa</a> ecosystem. However, you can get non-Alexa devices working too if you're like me and have already set up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/this-one-app-has-made-my-life-so-much-easier">Home Assistant</a> to interconnect all of the smart things in your home.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Famazonprime%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2911510914660593373-20" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-5537348904826820546-20" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.co.uk%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-21%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1143899270712558760-21" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.ca%2F%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-ca-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-2199188137085729072-20" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.in%2F%3Ftag%3Dtech0e7-21%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1078330179185197041-21" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:</strong> <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-3547428887931858450&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Felectronics%2Ftop-deals%2F" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-8437067604758290132&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17070419?sid=ac-us-1189917203389312740&url=https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=44583&u1=ac-us-1345623840917400546&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2F" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-17123350?sid=ac-us-1197418435517286269&url=https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/221109/81938/2092?subId1=ac-us-9991700354149096462&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Ftop-deals%2F-%2FN-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:</strong> <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-4846743479059614165&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-1170897447011388401&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fcp%2Fcell-phones%2F1105910%3Fpovid%3Dweb_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-8098914211323116751&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2Fcell-phone-deals%2F" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fs%3Fk%3Dcell%2Bphone%26crid%3D19CKV7OMEPEMF%26sprefix%3Dcell%2Bphone%252Caps%252C222%26ref%3Dnb_sb_noss_1%26tag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-1268085815373288301-20" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-1460612589454909304&url=https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a> <strong>|</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-1154352533149114139&url=https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It comes with 64GB of storage, a microSD slot for added storage, and around 13 hours of battery life per charge. It also has a 720p selfie camera with a physical privacy switch, a headphone jack, Bluetooth capabilities, and more, making it a worthy contender amongst today's market.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HZVQDL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RBtzuzNfJfWtjm8Ws6NDhC" name="lenovo-ideapad-slim-3-chromebook-abyss-blue-facing-right-square-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RBtzuzNfJfWtjm8Ws6NDhC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 Chromebook:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5HZVQDL" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$219.99" data-dimension48="$219.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$219.99</del> <strong>$178 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>The Slim 3 is just $178 for the remainder of Amazon Prime Day, representing a solid 19% discount from the normal purchase price.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>One of the best things about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> series, including the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, is the inclusion of Qi2. They're the first Android flagship phones to feature built-in magnets, which is a very convenient feature that iPhone users have been used to for years. Better late than never, and the fact that the Pixel 10 is just now getting Qi2 means there are already plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> that it can take advantage of, such as this <strong>Anker Nano Power Bank (5K, MagGo, Slim)</strong>, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8HXYD46">currently on sale for 27% off</a>.</p><p>This power bank normally costs $55, which isn't too bad for a portable wireless charger. The fact that it's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 charger</a> means it's more or less future-proof, at least for the time being, thus giving it more value. You can grab the power bank for less than $40 right now, and, if you ask me, it's definitely worth adding to your cart at this price before Prime Day ends.</p><p>You'll also notice that the description says "Not for Pixel," but I can't help but feel like this is misleading. I'll explain more below so you can decide.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT — see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="a-slim-magnetic-charger-for-less-than-40-2">A slim magnetic charger for less than $40</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="045caf4b-1ffe-4a81-959c-f7bcf12a2faf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Spend less than $40 to effectively double your phone's battery life with this 27% off Prime Day discount on an Anker Qi2 charger." data-dimension48="Spend less than $40 to effectively double your phone's battery life with this 27% off Prime Day discount on an Anker Qi2 charger." data-dimension25="$39.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8HXYD46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DLqTSpvCu8skxWfMQmhXuC" name="Anker-Nano-Power-Bank-5K-MagGo-Slim-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLqTSpvCu8skxWfMQmhXuC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Spend less than $40 to effectively double your phone's battery life with this 27% off Prime Day discount on an Anker Qi2 charger. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8HXYD46" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="045caf4b-1ffe-4a81-959c-f7bcf12a2faf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Spend less than $40 to effectively double your phone's battery life with this 27% off Prime Day discount on an Anker Qi2 charger." data-dimension48="Spend less than $40 to effectively double your phone's battery life with this 27% off Prime Day discount on an Anker Qi2 charger." data-dimension25="$39.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a slim and portable charger for your Qi2-compatible smartphone, which includes iPhones, the Pixel 10 series, and Samsung phones (to some extent).</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You don't have a Qi2 compatible smartphone or you're put off by the "Not for Pixel" notice</p><p>In the era of thin phones, the Anker Nano Power Bank (5K, MagGo, Slim) looks like an ideal companion. It measures only .34 inches and supports Qi2, so you can magnetically attach it to the back of your compatible phone. This would make it easier to charge while on the go, as you wouldn't necessarily have to carry a second device since it would be attached to the phone.</p><p>The Pixel 10 is already a somewhat thick phone, so having a charger that doesn't add too much thickness would be ideal. And since the charger sports a 5,000mAh capacity, you'll essentially be able to double your Pixel's battery life, since it has a capacity of 4,970mAh. Some of the color options might even pair well with your device if you go caseless (although we recommend a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">Pixel 10 case</a> to protect your investment).</p><p>The "Not for Pixel" notice in the description seems foreboding, and Anker's documentation only highlights support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhones</a>. That said, there doesn't appear to be any reason why this Qi2 charger doesn't support a Qi2 phone like the Pixel 10, or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2-Ready</a> phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a> series. One reviewer even highlights how they use the charger with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a>, and it works fine, with the only complaint being heat.</p><p>Also note that this only supports 15W charging, so Pixel 10 Pro XL users may have to look elsewhere for 25W speeds.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-2">Shop All Amazon Deals — Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

If you do need more than that, you can also upgrade to 256GB or 512GB, though 128GB is likely sufficient for most casual users.</p><p>The S25 boasts pretty impressive performance speeds, as backed by its Snapdragon CPU and 8GB of RAM. This largely explains the flagship-level price tag, which is normally $800 without the current Prime Day deal.</p><p>The phone also comes with a seven-year software update promise, a refreshed One UI update, and a broad range of Samsung's latest Galaxy features. Add in Qi wireless charging, 25W wired fast-charging, and all-day battery life for those who aren't using their phone all the time, and you're looking at a pretty decent value proposition with the current discount.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3DB4CW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA" name="samsung galaxy s25 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfcXMYkPcazrcyA9X2i5jA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DP3DB4CW" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$799.99</del> <strong>$599.99 for Amazon Prime Day</strong></a></p><p>As Amazon's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide">Prime Day</a> starts nearing the end, the retailer is still offering a wave of phone discounts, including $200 off the Samsung Galaxy S25, our favorite compact phone.

The phone normally retails at $800, but with this Prime discount it's just $600, offering a pretty great price point for what you get.</p><p>The S25 has a 6.2-inch Dynamic AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, One UI 7, a built-in ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, and a 4,000mAh battery. This model has 128GB of storage, though you can also upgrade to either 256GB or 512GB if you require additional storage. Performance is backed by the powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor, as well as 12GB of RAM.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest downside for the S25 is that Samsung hasn't updated the camera suite for a few generations, though that may not be a deal breaker for some.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-12">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

With up to 75 hours of battery, the Focus A6 are an endurance champ. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/OneOdio-Focus-A6-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0F9YVKQ78/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="de4274da-d5b5-46b6-8520-83c2fdc35755" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$69.99" data-dimension48="$69.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you have a tight budget and want a pair of wireless, over-ear headphones; you need active noise-canceling and transparency modes; you value long battery life with ANC on or off.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you have more to spend and want better sound or ANC quality; you need headphones with a 3.5mm jack.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-get-from-a-55-pair-of-headphones-in-2025-2">What do you get from a $55 pair of headphones in 2025?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXezCUWqxVniiRZYCDiJ7H" name="OneOdio-Focus-A6-1" alt="The OneOdio Focus A6 headphones hanging from a light and speaker." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXezCUWqxVniiRZYCDiJ7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I insinuated earlier, setting the right expectations is crucial to enjoying the OneOdio Focus A6. At only $55, these headphones aren't going to blow you away in terms of sound quality or active noise cancelation (ANC). When you account for the price, they feel much more impressive. There's plenty of volume and the sound signature is actually quite balanced, even if the Focus A6 might benefit from slightly more bass.</p><p>OneOdio says that the Focus A6 use a five-microphone system for ANC that "blocks up to 98% of background hum and engine noise." After testing the Focus A6 for myself, this is the best way to describe the headphones' ANC capabilities. The OneOdio Focus A6 will do just fine and canceling out consistent, low-end sounds.</p><p>Compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">more expensive options</a>, they won't do as well with voices, music, or bursts of noise. You shouldn't expect the Focus A6 to completely block out a noisy coffee shop or a crowded office, but you can expect them to eliminate a loud A/C unit or a running car engine. That said, the passive noise cancelation is decent and turning up the volume certainly helps muffle external noise.</p><p>Transparency mode is solid, too — you can hold a conversation while wearing the Focus A6 with this setting enabled. It's also nice that you can cycle through modes with a physical button, even if the plastic used here feels somewhat cheap.</p><p>There are plenty of redeeming qualities of the OneOdio Focus A6 as well. There's a USB-C port used for charging and wired audio playback, with support for the high-res LDAC audio codec. Additionally, battery life is outstanding, as the Focus A6 offer 70 hours with ANC off and 40 hours with ANC on.</p><p>As long as you don't expect too much for from the OneOdio Focus A6, they prove to be a reasonable set of ANC headphones at a $55 price point that feels too good to be true.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-2">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's particularly well-liked for its low sticker price, but it also features 64GB of storage, a microSD slot for expanded storage, and dual stereo speakers.</p><p>It's worth noting that the A9 Plus isn't compatible with Samsung's first-party stylus, the S Pen.

While this particular model only has 64GB of storage, the A9 Plus also includes a microSD slot for expanding storage up to 1TB, or you can upgrade to the 128GB configuration. With 4GB of RAM and a basic Qualcomm Snapdragon 695, performance isn't going to be anything to write home about on the A9 Plus, but it's still a worthy pick as far as budget tablets go.</p><p>The A9 Plus also comes with dual stereo speakers that get relatively loud, while also featuring 8MP and 5MP rear and front cameras, respectively.</p><p>To be sure, the screen's resolution is only 1920 x 1200, so those in need of a higher quality display will want to look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a great pick for families and casual users, and it's hard to go wrong at such a low price.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-17">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
