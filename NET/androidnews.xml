                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google I/O 2024</a> keynote is over, and if you&apos;re interested in new ways Google can inject AI into its products, you probably think you want to see it if you missed it. Really, you don&apos;t.</p><p>The cool new features and products are there. The problem is they are buried under the most boring and technical I/O keynote presentation ever. Unless you&apos;re a developer who uses Google products and the Google ecosystem, it just wasn&apos;t for you.</p>
<p>Normally, I would be the first to point out that Google I/O is a developer conference that is meant for developers to learn about development. This is true, and if you fit this description, you should find a way to experience it at least once. On that front, Google I/O is amazing.</p><p>But this was the keynote presentation. The part of the week that is supposed to get the "average Joe and Jane" excited about the future so that they <em>want</em> to use the cool new products developers can make using all the new stuff.</p><p>Combine that with the fact that a large number of people attending are there as press or influencers, and it makes the whole thing look really weird this time. Members of the tech press are there to tell you about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">cool new phones</a> and how Google is making things better, not explain the differences between Gemini 7b and Gemini 2b.</p>
<p>If you slogged through it, you did see some cool, even futuristic stuff. Privacy concerns aside, Google can now integrate into your life in ways it couldn&apos;t before and even be useful. An example is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/nXVvvRhiGjI?si=Ih8P4yUJOYXSgPHA">Google&apos;s Project Astra</a> remembering where a pair of glasses were sitting. The days of a lost remote control are over once this goes live.</p><p>For every good example, though, we heard a word salad of things that "normal" people just don&apos;t care about. Telling developers about multimodal inputs or that they have access to two million tokens is fine. Telling everyone about it is silly because almost nobody cares, or most might not even understand what it means.</p>

<p>Regular people, and probably shareholders, too, aren&apos;t interested in how the fudge is made. We only care about the results, whether they are useful enhancements, new products, or new revenue streams for Google itself. In my past life, I spent way too much time trying to get computers and cameras to recognize the things they were seeing, and having this level of tech would have been amazing. But even I stopped being interested about 20 minutes into the program.</p>
<p>The show started right, with Pichai telling people how Google has spent billions of dollars and over 10 years <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">working on AI</a> and its infrastructure. Google is competing with companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-gpt-4o-launch-demo">OpenAI</a> and should remind us that Google has a huge advantage when it comes to experience and scale. It&apos;s how Google will "win" the AI race once all the dust settles.</p><p>It also ended right. Knowing about how Google is managing the risks that come with AI and what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-works-hard-to-make-sure-ai-isnt-evil">its principles are</a>. That&apos;s more important than the products themselves and Google has to lead by example because it is about to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-ai-overviews-test-expansion">dump AI on everyone</a> who uses Google Search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB" name="Google-IO-2024-ai-count.jpeg" alt="AI count of 121 at Google I/O 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bfrvFTcdoqM8oi9GxXUidB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything in between was developer-focused. I know I know, developer conference, but the keynote is also supposed to get everyone excited about what&apos;s coming. Google helped create this situation where a developer conference has morphed into a press event. Abandoning the idea seems short-sighted.</p><p>That isn&apos;t going to happen, and you&apos;re going to have to wait to see how any of this stuff matters when it comes to you.</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (May 15), Sony is debuting its 2024 flagship phone, the Xperia 1 VI, which strongly focuses on gaming, audio, and display functionality.</p><p>Sony detailed the latest Xperia 1 VI in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/presscentre/sony-announces-latest-premium-smartphone-xperia-1-vi">press release</a>, and we&apos;re kicking things off with its "smarter" display. According to the company, the Xperia 1 VI boasts a 6.5-inch BRAVIA-powered screen that is reportedly 1.5 times brighter than its predecessor. Sony has also worked on "Sunlight Vision," designed to give users more screen visibility when outside.</p><p>Powering the device&apos;s capabilities is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a>, however, Sony&apos;s in-house Exmor T sensor with AI processing helps its cameras. The company states that the flagship phone features a 52MP (48MP effective) primary lens, a 12MP telephoto lens, and a 12MP ultrawide lens.</p><p>The telephoto lens uses an x7.1 zoom with an 85mm to 170mm focal length alongside macro technology. Thanks to these advancements, users can go from a 2x zoom to a close 4cm zoom.</p><p>Additionally, the Xperia 1 VI offers AF tracking with "human pose estimation." Sony states this is done via an AI feature created by Alpha series cameras. The feature reportedly "recognizes" a human frame (skeleton) to provide the Xperia 1 VI with "precise" tracking even through objects that could cover a person&apos;s body.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Md6Mhe8ZxU4KjvwyMnkQoU" name="sony-xperia-1-vi-camera-app-ui.jpg" alt="The Sony Xperia 1 VI and the camera app's updated UI." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Md6Mhe8ZxU4KjvwyMnkQoU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new camera app joins the improved camera functionality. Sony states it has pushed an update for the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s camera app that includes a "friendly" UI for seamless navigation. The update is designed to prioritize convenience for the user without tucking away any of its options for more creativity behind walls. Photographers will find color presets like "Creative Look" and shooting modes like PSM.</p><p>Touch tracking lets users customize their brightness and adjust colors, and the new Pro mode provides an array of detailed settings for video capture.</p><p>For gaming, Sony highlights the Xperia 1 VI&apos;s "FPS Optimizer." When used, the optimizer bolsters the device&apos;s CPU usage and frame rate based on the game. Inputs matter in gaming, so Sony has refined it by offering three tracking speeds and two levels of "tap accuracy."</p><p>Sony&apos;s latest flagship features improved sound, courtesy of the Premium Audio Circuit, crafted with 3.5mm headphones in mind. The company adds that the speaker unit&apos;s upgrades help reduce sound distortion at high volumes, and low-frequency output has received a tune-up.</p><p>Select wireless headphones are said to benefit from AAC (Advanced Audio Coding) for enhanced sound quality when outside in the city.</p>

<p>What will get your Xperia 1 VI through the day is a 5,000mAh battery. A new heat-dissipating component and low-power display consumption will aid the device in reaching nearly 36 hours of "continuous" video playback. Sony estimates the Xperia 1 VI can reach a 50% charge (30W) in just thirty minutes. Features like Battery Care and Xperia Adaptive Charging aid the device&apos;s battery to ensure its health.</p><p>Android 14 will await users out of the box, alongside three years of OS upgrades, and four years of security updates.</p><p>The Xperia 1 VI is on the way with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The device is available today (May 15) for pre-order on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.co.uk/smartphones/products/xperia-1m6">Sony&apos;s U.K. website</a> for £1,299 (roughly $1,646). The phone will hit the market in June and consumers can grab it in black, Khaki Green, and Platinum Silver colorways.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Honor has launched a limited public beta test for Android 15, starting with the Magic 6 Pro and Magic V2.</li><li>This release coincides with Google's second Android 15 beta for Pixel phones, and Honor is one of the manufacturers participating.</li><li>Unlike the Pixel phones, the Honor devices are currently receiving the first beta version of Android 15, not the second.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor has kicked off its limited public beta testing for Android 15, beginning with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review">Honor Magic 6 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v2-review">Magic V2</a>.</p><p>Today&apos;s announcement lines up with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-beta-2-just-landed-for-google-pixels-and-non-pixel-devices-too">launch of the second Android 15 beta for Google Pixel phones</a>. Google also revealed that other manufacturers, including Honor, are joining the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> beta program.</p><p>However, the Honor Magic 6 Pro and Magic V2 aren&apos;t receiving Android 15 Beta 2 just yet. Instead, Honor is releasing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">first beta version</a> to these devices, with developers having access to the update since May 10.</p><p>The Android 15 beta release is happening about a month after Honor started looking for testers for the Android 14 beta program on its Magic V2.</p><p>Even though the Magic 6 Pro and Magic V2 launched close together, they started on different Android versions. The former shipped with Android 14 out of the box, while the newer foldable came with Android 15 pre-loaded. This means the Magic 6 Pro is getting its first taste of Android 15 with this beta, while the V2 is getting its second update. That said, both phones get four major MagicOS updates in the end.</p><p>Android 15 is all about putting you in charge and keeping your data safe. The latest release includes an SDK sandbox feature, which restricts ad services in a "sandbox," so they&apos;re unable to reach your private information.</p><p>Additionally, Android 15 gives you a new control panel for your privacy settings, where you can see exactly what&apos;s going on and make sure your data stays under wraps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3GPpKbZFep2F68amBqgQTJ" name="Honor-Android-15-beta.jpg" alt="Honor Android 15 beta program" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3GPpKbZFep2F68amBqgQTJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor conducting trials for a major update is a promising indicator that its phones will have solid firmware support moving forward. Generally, you want these firmware updates to ensure your phone remains compatible with the latest apps and security features.</p><p>For the time being, the Android 15 beta program for the Magic 6 Pro and Magic V2 is closed to the public and is only for developers. Honor will keep giving developers support as it releases the next update to the Android 15 beta program later this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google just unveiled a bunch of new features and apps for cars equipped with Google built-in and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-new-android-auto">Android Auto</a>, including entertainment apps like Max, Peacock, and Angry Birds.</p><p>However, the news that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-cast-chrome">Google Cast</a> will be available in cars with the Android Automotive OS will probably generate a lot of buzz. This comes as software developers are eager to add more features and capabilities to cars.</p><p>Google Cast&apos;s arrival on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-automotive-hands-on">Android Automotive</a> means you&apos;ll be able to stream video content from your phone or tablet straight to your car&apos;s screen while parked, even if the app doesn’t support native casting. Initially, this feature will roll out in Rivian models, with more cars to follow, Google&apos;s announcement says.</p><p>Additionally, the Uber Driver app is now on Android Auto, letting drivers accept rides, navigate deliveries, and get all the directions they need on large infotainment screens.</p><p>Google also makes it easier for developers to bring existing apps to cars. The company will provide guidelines for creating streamlined in-car experiences and new tools to simplify the process.</p><p>As part of this effort, Google is launching a program called "Car ready mobile apps." Basically, the tech giant will check out an existing mobile app to see if it&apos;s already car-friendly. If it passes, Google will automatically add it to Android Auto—no extra work for developers.</p><p>The program will initially include apps for video, gaming, and browsing while parked, with plans to add more categories later.</p><p>Over the past few years, Google has focused on enhancing your in-car entertainment options for times when you&apos;re parked or stuck in traffic. At its I/O conference last year, the company revealed plans to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-apps-features-for-android-equipped-cars">bring streaming video and virtual meeting tools to car infotainment screens</a>. Google also announced that Volvo and Polestar would be the first to offer YouTube on their in-car systems, with more automakers following suit later.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/android-for-cars-bringing-more-apps-to-cars.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Google highlights the growing opportunity to provide safe and seamless connected experiences for drivers and passengers as car technology advances. With this in mind, Google is set to offer more entertainment options for when we&apos;re stuck in our cars.</p><p>However, as infotainment systems grow flashier and more complex, distraction continues to be a significant issue for modern drivers.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced the Wear OS 5 Developer Preview launch at Google I/O 2024. </li><li>Wear OS 5 watch faces will get "Flavors" and exclusive Complications. </li><li>Android Health will add new running data and goals, plus Health Connect upgrades.</li><li>Wear OS watches will now last 20% longer during tracked workouts. </li></ul>
<hr>
<p>To no one&apos;s surprise, Wear OS 5 will arrive "later this year," Google reported at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024</a>. Battery life enhancements are "central" to the update, which you can test today via the Developer Preview. But Google also emphasized health and fitness tracking with this future update — more unexpected and certainly welcome. </p><p>Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/watch-face-format-for-future-wear-os-releases">Watch Face Format (WFF)</a> earlier this year, both of which made Wear OS 4 more efficient. Wear OS 5 piggybacks on these updates, improving watches&apos; efficiency and adding more exciting watch face tricks. </p><p>On the battery front, Android developers Kseniia Shumelchyk and Garan Jenkin explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/whats-new-in-wear-os-io-24.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> how "running a marathon consumes up to 20% less power on Wear OS 5 than on Wear OS 4" with default settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fFKWyEW7dpk5BgQ77Jfykg" name="wear-os-5-promo-image.jpeg" alt="Promo image for Wear OS 5 showing two athletes running with Wear OS watches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFKWyEW7dpk5BgQ77Jfykg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That&apos;s merely one example; all workouts that sample heart rate and GPS should run more efficiently. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2024/05/the-latest-updates-from-android-health-io-2024.html" target="_blank">Android Health upgrades</a> are a significant portion of Wear OS 5&apos;s updates. For starters, the new OS will add four advanced running form measurements: Ground Contact Time, Stride Length, Vertical Oscillation, and Vertical Ratio. </p><p>In addition, Wear OS 5 will support "debounced goals" for fitness workouts. What does this mean? Let&apos;s say you start a workout where you must stay within a certain heart rate range or run faster than 10:00/mile pace. In Wear OS 4, the app will continuously spam your wrist with alerts the moment you fall out of range. With Wear OS 5, devs can program a short delay, preventing false positives and making alerts less obnoxious. </p><p>Guided workouts and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-interview-how-fix-running-form">wrist-based running dynamics</a> are common features on dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a>, so this addition to Wear OS 5 should make devices like the Pixel Watch 3 more competitive. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:114.53%;"><img id="J7c7RZuvYoMPQ4ZqKyyQqf" name="new-wear-os-5-fitness-dev-tools.jpeg" alt="The new Wear OS 5 fitness app widget for developers" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7c7RZuvYoMPQ4ZqKyyQqf.jpg" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="" width="578" height="662" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The new Wear OS 5 Health Services panel </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the Wear OS developer end, Android Studio Koala will "make it easier to test the use of Health Services." Devs will "simulate events" like loss of heart rate data or an auto-pause mechanic, so Wear OS fitness apps become less likely to trigger unexpected bugs. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> — the Google Fit replacement that links 3rd-party fitness apps together — will get one important upgrade. In Wear OS 4, 3rd-party apps will only share up to a month of fitness data, and only when they&apos;re open and active. With Wear OS 5, Health Connect and fitness apps will sync in the background and share all of your historical data, so long as you provide permission first. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1124px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.14%;"><img id="UgB9dWgac7gUKCiuwEBhZg" name="wear-os-5-new-watch-faces.jpeg" alt="A selection of upcoming Wear OS 5 watch faces" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UgB9dWgac7gUKCiuwEBhZg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1124" height="631" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Upcoming Wear OS 5 watch faces </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For everyday Wear OS 5 users, you&apos;ll most appreciate the changes to the Watch Face Format. Developers can add "Flavors" to watch faces, so users can choose between different colors, fonts, complications, and other configurations in one menu.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf" name="wear-os-5-watch-face-flavors.jpeg" alt="New Wear OS 5 watch face Flavors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YvBWR53dEmxCTSjK6KNGxf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1488" height="837" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Two new WFF complications for Wear OS 5 are "Goal progress" and "Weighted elements." You&apos;ll be able to check your percentage towards a fitness target like step count or see specific colored portions that add up to 100% (like a pie chart). </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:823px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:37.79%;"><img id="MkYYrbtNSBRccXDyKLoPKg" name="new-complications-wear-os-5.jpeg" alt="New Wear OS 5 complications for Goal progress and weighted elements" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MkYYrbtNSBRccXDyKLoPKg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="823" height="311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Adding a weather widget to WFF was a "common request," Google reports, and Wear OS 5 will make that happen. You&apos;ll be able to check current conditions, low and high temps, UV index, chance of rain, and other data, set either by hour or by day. </p><p>Google reports that 30% of Google Play watch faces use WFF, and it&apos;s clear that they want to push more devs into this format. New Wear OS 5 complications may not work with old formats, and Google Play will restrict new watch faces to WFF starting in "early 2025," although devs can continue to update older formats. </p><p>Lastly, Google says that there&apos;s a "wider variety of round screen sizes and resolutions" on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> today, which means devs need "responsive UIs for different watch display sizes." Devs are receiving new testing tools to evaluate how their apps will look on different devices, so they should become better formatted regardless of the display size you prefer. </p><p>You can check out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/versions/5">Wear OS 5 Developer Preview</a> at that link. </p>
<h2 id="a-step-in-the-right-direction-with-one-worry-2">A step in the right direction (with one worry)</h2>
<p>Google says that Wear OS users grew by 40% in 2023; evidently, the platform has become more popular than ever. It&apos;s important that Wear OS 5 build on that momentum, and today&apos;s announcements were (mostly) encouraging. </p><p>Wear OS 5 should make Android watches more long-lived in daily use, widening the gap between them and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-series-9-long-term-review">Apple Watches</a>. That&apos;s great, in theory. My concern is <em>how</em> Wear OS 5 consumes "20% less power" during a marathon. </p><p>I suspect Google might rely on the hybrid interface, having watches&apos; energy-efficient co-processors sample your health data to save on battery. That&apos;s how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> handled things, and it led to inaccurate workout data because of its slow, RTOS-running coprocessor. </p><p>This is fully speculative, and perhaps a Pixel Watch 3 fully running on Wear OS 5 wouldn&apos;t have the same issues. But I&apos;m looking forward to testing the OS myself to see whether its heart rate and GPS data can stay accurate while drawing less power. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ" name="oneplus-watch-2-15.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 activity data" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQBqDky2XkE7PBWYDQekpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Activity data on the OnePlus Watch 2 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I originally hoped that Google would announce a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-io-2024-needs-fitness-app-announcement-wear-os-5">universal Wear OS fitness app</a> like Fitbit at I/O 2024. While this never happened, the Wear OS 5 update is putting more power in the hands of developers to make Wear OS watches more viable for fitness activities than they are right now. </p><p>We didn&apos;t get <em>major</em> fitness features, but we can expect the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a> announcements to capitalize on this fitness momentum later this year. For instance, the One UI Watch 6 update will probably include the "My Vitality score" metric that&apos;ll mirror Fitbit&apos;s Daily Readiness Score. </p><p>On the watch face front, the new WFF is very energy efficient but lacks much of the creativity and functionality of older watch faces, which is why many turn to Facer despite the battery life hit. Wear OS 5 will hopefully put WFF on the right track towards being more widely adopted. </p><p>Overall, I&apos;m satisfied that Google isn&apos;t twiddling its thumbs with Wear OS. This looks to be a significant update later in 2024. I only wish that Google had spent a little time showing off Wear OS features on stage during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024 keynote</a> instead of relegating the news to blog posts. </p>

<hr>
<p>A day after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google’s I/O 2024 conference</a>, the company released Android 15 Beta 2. This update packs major improvements in productivity, privacy, security, app performance, and battery health.</p><p>The latest build is up for grabs on select Google Pixel and many of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">favorite Android phones</a> from brands like Honor, iQOO, Lenovo, Nothing, OnePlus, OPPO, Realme, Sharp, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi. We&apos;re nearing a stable release, but if you&apos;re eager for a sneak peek, check out this new beta.</p><p>Just like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-first-beta-milestone-rolls-out">the last beta</a>, Android 15 Beta 2 is packed with loads of new features. One cool addition is <em>Private space</em>, which lets you hide apps in a separate area, similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-secure-folders-your-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung&apos;s <em>Secure Folder</em></a>. Google has been working on this feature since 2023, and it&apos;s finally here.</p><p>Private space uses a separate profile, so apps you hide there can&apos;t be seen by others or run in the background when locked. You can even set a different lock for it than your main phone. Plus, you can keep your private stuff separate but still share it with other apps when you need to.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:210.00%;"><img id="sLNByZ6HXuwJnNYHoNdHVA" name="private-space.gif" alt="Android 15 private space" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLNByZ6HXuwJnNYHoNdHVA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="672" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another cool update is that apps can now ask for access to just your most recent photos, not your whole library. This is handy for those times when apps seem to want your entire life story in pictures.</p><p>Google has also announced that dav1d, the popular AV1 software decoder from VideoLAN, is now available for Android devices that don&apos;t support AV1 hardware decoding. This means smoother playback of high-quality videos, even on older phones.</p><p>Even better, this new decoder will be the default for everyone soon, and some older phones (back to Android 11) can get it too through Google Play updates.</p><p>Android 15 Beta 2 also makes multitasking even easier. You can keep a taskbar handy for switching apps on the fly by pinning it on the screen, and you can even save your favorite split-screen combos for instant access.</p><p>The latest beta also tweaks picture-in-picture (PiP), making transitions smoother when entering PiP mode. Additionally, Google is spicing up widgets by offering personalized previews. Apps targeting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> can now supply <em>Remote Views</em> to the widget picker, updating the content to better reflect what users will see on their screens.</p>

<p>In Android 15, Google has made the predictive back feature a standard option, no longer hidden behind developer settings. This means smoother system animations like back-to-home, cross-task, and cross-activity will now be visible for compatible apps.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-google-health-connect">Health Connect</a> is expanding its support to include new data types like skin temperature and training plans. Skin temperature tracking lets users store and share precise temperature readings from wearables or other devices. Meanwhile, training plans provide structured workout routines designed to help users meet their fitness goals.</p><p>Google has also introduced a new feature in Android 15 Beta 2 that limits the runtime of certain foreground services to six hours. This change is aimed at improving battery health.</p><p>Google is beefing up security in Android 15 by giving users greater control to prevent malicious apps from operating in the background and bringing other apps to the foreground. This update aims to block malicious apps from gaining elevated privileges and exploiting user interactions.</p><p>Since Android 10, restrictions on background activity launches have been in place. However, Google has identified that "task hijacking" attacks can still bypass these limitations. To counter this, Google has introduced a new security measure in Android 15: a flag that prevents apps that don&apos;t match the top user ID on the stack from launching activities, thereby mitigating the risk of such attacks.</p><p>Android 15 has raised the minimum targetSdkVersion required for app installations from 23 to 24. This change ensures that all apps meet newer standards for performance and security.</p><p>Devices already enrolled in the Android 14 QPR beta program will automatically receive an incremental update to Android 15 Beta 2 over the air. If you don&apos;t have a supported device, you can use the 64-bit system images with the Android Emulator in Android Studio to test the new features.</p>

<ul><li>Google is highlighting several ways it's preparing to help users protect their devices and data if it's stolen.</li><li>A new "Private Spaces" feature is set to arrive, letting users create a new space on their device for apps that could contain sensitive information.</li><li>Google's AI also lends a hand in sensing when a user's device has been stolen to lock down and protect your data.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024</a>, Google highlights a few ways it&apos;s preparing to bring more theft protection to users and their Android devices.</p><p>According to a press release, device and data protection kicks off the series of updates regarding the factory reset option. Google states that if a thief attempts to "force" a factory reset on your device, they cannot set it up properly from scratch. The reset&apos;s upgrade will ask for the owner&apos;s Google account, and without it, the device will be "unsellable, reducing incentives for phone theft."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:599px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.17%;"><img id="D6pfZAEsAYnhULWMHgRj9Z" name="google-io-android-security-theft-protection.jpg" alt="Google is preparing to introduce new theft protection features for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6pfZAEsAYnhULWMHgRj9Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="599" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new feature is set to arrive known as "Private Space." Through this area, Google says users can create another section on their phone for apps that may contain sensitive health or financial information. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/files-google-gets-pin-protected-safe-folder-hide-your-personal-files">Safe Folder</a>, users can enter a unique PIN to ensure the space remains secure.</p><p>Altering features on an Android device will change later this year. The post states that users looking to disable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">Find My Device</a> or extend the screen timeout timer will have to input their PIN, password, or biometric (face, fingerprint) to push the change through.</p><p>If a thief knows the PIN, Google is preparing to roll out an "Enhanced Authentication" feature to protect your device. When enabled, the company says the device will demand its owners&apos; biometrics before it allows "critical" Google Account information to be altered.</p><p>With these updates incoming, Google states that Private Spaces and the new factory reset option will arrive with Android 15. The others are set to debut on "select" devices "later this year."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q2S6qMrzq4LRas9GgD3cQX" name="Google-IO-2024-preshow-coffee.jpg" alt="A giant coffee cup on the Google I/O 2024 stage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q2S6qMrzq4LRas9GgD3cQX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>AI was the headliner at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">Google&apos;s I/O </a>event this year, and we&apos;re seeing that influence bleed over into protecting a user&apos;s device if snatched. The company says that a new automatic AI-powered screen lock will soon arrive via "Theft Detection Lock." Piggybacking off Google AI, if the system detects motion akin to a phone being snatched and the perpetrator running off, your Android device will lock itself.</p><p>Joining this is "Offline Device Lock," which will force the Android device to bunker down if a thief takes it offline for too long. Users must enable this feature to protect their device if someone has taken it offline to avoid being located. Additionally, the device will lock down if multiple failed attempts at authentication have been made.</p><p>Both of these features are preparing to arrive on Android 10 devices and above through a Play services update "later this year."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:776px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:77.32%;"><img id="H4RpKMzMAqTzz9bW4nx7fi" name="google-io-android-security-remote-lock.jpg" alt="Google will introduce "Remote Lock" for users on Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H4RpKMzMAqTzz9bW4nx7fi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="776" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The last major theft protection update involves "Remote Lock." Google states users will soon be able to remotely lock their devices with just their phone number after completing a security challenge. The company hopes this gives users time to utilize other tools to relocate their devices and obtain their data. This feature will roll out to Android 10 and above devices "later this year" following a Play services update.</p><p>Alongside these Android device-specific security updates, Google is tacking on a few extra to prevent fraud. The company will look to better protect one-time passwords by hiding them from your notifications. Restricted settings are receiving an expansion, with Google informing that it will require additional approval from the user to enable permissions for side-loaded apps.</p><p>Other security layers are entering to bolster safer logins by hiding your screen during a screen-share session. Similarly, users other than Pixel owners will soon pick up the ability to choose what they share from an app instead of exposing everything they have stored.</p><p>Cellular protections are en route for Android 15, giving users the ability to protect themselves from "cell site simulators" and SMS-based fraud messages. Developers of Play Store apps will receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-io-2024-new-tools">some extra security tools</a>, as well, to monitor for prying eyes and more.</p>

<ul><li>Following I/O 2024, Google is highlighting a few AR experiences on their way to Android.</li><li>Google Maps is picking up an "AR experience" button for Street View and more, giving users a chance to "simulate" an adventure through a city.</li><li>Google Arts & Culture is getting in on the AR fun by preparing a new experience through Paris for the 1900 Universal Exhibition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>AR features provided by Google are staring at some upgrades following its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news/live/google-io-2024-live-blog">I/O 2024</a> event for Maps and more.</p><p>As detailed in a press release, Google Maps is adopting a pilot program that will increase the amount of AR content available to users. Specifically, geospatial AR content will be available on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android device</a> when using Street View or Lens in Maps.</p><p>To get started, Google states that users can discover AR content on maps by searching for a location. If the company features support for it, users can tap on "AR Experience" and lift their phones to view the surrounding area. What this experience does is let users roam around an area remotely. This is also said to extend to uses engaging in Street View.</p><p>There will be an option to share your AR experience with others in Maps by copying a deep link URL or quickly sending a QR code. This early pilot program is said to begin in Singapore before moving to Paris "later this year." Google states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8MxAabn4UHxJsJvqSXCmJ0nhvbR5M9kYa_Jg0oamuYPBB2g/viewform?resourcekey=0-4s51kTAI94KvIj_iS7pjUA">pilot program</a> in those areas will last for roughly six months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vy9wjipiWtnzpbzdancHpd" name="google-arts-and-culture-redesign-hero.jpg" alt="Google's newly redesigned Arts & Culture app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vy9wjipiWtnzpbzdancHpd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="676" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Arts & Culture is getting in on the geospatial AR experience as it partners with Rock Paper Reality. By taking a step back through time in Paris, Google states users can experience the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/story/gQUxlJulFRZmXg">Pavilions of the 1900 Universal Exhibition</a> and visit locations like the Eiffel Tower on their phones. Through AR, Google adds that users can seamlessly and easily hear these past stories and "visit" these locations from comfort.</p><p>More updates are to come for these historical stories later this summer.</p><p>Google is extending its AR experience to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.visitsingapore.com/en/">Singapore Tourism Board</a> alongside its local partners. The company states users interested in engaging can go through Meril&apos;s Immersive Adventure to find new points of interest and "key" tourism spots around the city. Singapore&apos;s Chinatown and Gardens by the Bay are a tap away through its AR experience.</p><p>Users can roam around these beautiful areas in Singapore through Google Maps.</p><p>Lastly, there are a few geospatial updates Google is highlighting following I/O 2024. The first is an announcement for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/aero.html">Geospatial Creator in Adobe Zero</a>, which is now available to all users. Developers can now begin creating their own "world-scale" AR experiences using the software today (May 15). The second update sees the expansion of support for ARCore Geospatial API coverage.</p><p>Google states it now covers India, bringing in more innovation and engagement. Geospatial AR technology is beginning its expansion on Android first, with the company teasing more updates to come.</p>

<p>OnePlus Watch 2 is gaining an update that introduces two new apps for smartwatch users. It further comes with bug fixes and handy new features.</p><p>As spotted by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-update-new-relax-and-barometer-apps-3442315/">Android Authority</a>, the new update bearing  <strong>OPWWE231_11_A.94</strong> version is being rolled out to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> users, bringing new apps dubbed Relax and Barometer and a few other changes. </p><p>The former packs a set of breathing exercises for the smartwatch users, including Mindful Breathing, Bee breathing, and Pre-sleep breathing. Users can set multiple timers to start the exercise and are further guided to perform those exercises. </p>

<p>The Barometer, on the other hand, showcases atmospheric pressure. However, users can only play around with so many settings/ screens. The publication further notes the new inclusion of the “Tap to wake” toggle and a new battery tile on the home screen of the OnePlus Watch 2. </p><p>While the feature is self-explanatory, there is a new setting to turn it off, as it can reduce accidental touches and save battery life. The latest update also brings tons of new watch faces that can be accessed within the OHealth app for the OnePlus Watch 2. </p><p>Here’s the full changelog for the update shared by the publication:</p>
<ul><li>This update introduces several new features and fixes known issues. Update now for a smoother user experience.</li><li>Optimizes data display during workouts.</li><li>Adds support for accessing Music Controller by swiping left during a workout.</li><li>Adds Relax and Barometer apps.</li><li>Adds new features in the Phone app in Power Saver mode, including displaying contacts, favoriting contacts, and displaying call logs.</li><li>Adds support for turning off “Tap to wake.”</li><li>Enhances the experience of removing a watch face.</li><li>Optimizes some workout and health algorithms.</li><li>Fixes other known issues.</li></ul>

<p>Meanwhile, the company has also started rolling out a new <strong>OxygenOS 14.0.0.701</strong> firmware update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus 12R</a> users in North America, which comes in batches. In an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1592896348611411976">accompanying community post</a>, OnePlus shared the full changelog, which includes smoother animations, a touch control experience, and improvements to the system on the latest mid-range handset from the company. </p><p>Across the interface, OnePlus 12R users can experience wallpaper zoom alongside seamless icon transitions during app launch and while exiting apps. There’s a new bounce animation effect while accessing the app drawer, and the Quick Setting icon also gets layer effects. Additionally, animations are optimized on home screen icons, widgets, and even wallpaper zoom, which should look smoother after the new update.</p><p>Here are some more from the changelog that should bring OnePlus 12R users a new touch control experience:</p>
<ul><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping in from one side of the screen to exit an app before it starts up.</li><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping in from one side of the screen to go back to the previous page before a new page is opened.</li><li>Adds a transition animation when swiping inward from a side of the screen or swiping up to exit an app in landscape mode.</li><li>You can now tap the lower right corner of a large folder to view more apps.</li><li>You can now pull down app icons in large folders and then open an app in just one move.</li><li>Improves touch control responsiveness. Tapping and swiping on the Home and Recent tasks screens is now faster and more stable.</li><li>It increases touch responsiveness for app usage scenarios, such as opening and closing apps, entering and exiting recent tasks, or swiping on the gesture guide bar to switch between apps.</li><li>Optimizes animations when using large folders. Dragging apps on the Home screen is now smoother.</li></ul>

<p>On the other hand, system-wide improvements include the ability to adjust volume in Quick Settings. Users can further hide the track pattern when drawing on the lock screen. </p><p>Floating windows can now be resized by dragging them to the bottom.
