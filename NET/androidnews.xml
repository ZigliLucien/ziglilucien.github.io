They're both powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 9500 platform, get the same storage variants, have a similar-sized 6.78-inch AMOLED panel, same ultrasonic fingerprint modules, and a big battery.</p><p>They even share the same 50MP Sony LYT-828 main camera and 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle modules, and a 200MP telephoto lens — albeit one that's slightly different, with the Find X9 Pro featuring the Samsung HP5 module (Vivo uses a custom HPB sensor). Heck, OPPO even has a telephoto extender this year, which is similar to what Vivo provides on the X300 Pro.</p><p>Although there are many hardware similarities, these devices aren't identical to use — far from it. Vivo and OPPO clearly diverge when it comes to their camera tuning, and that was immediately evident when I started using the Find X9 Pro. The software is refreshingly different as well, even if both phone makers chose to "borrow" iOS 26's translucent effects.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rEnj2pkAWgFVbFbzbgbaGM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyway, back to the cameras. OPPO is using a new Lumo camera engine, with the brand noting that it overhauled its imaging algorithms to deliver cleaner and more detailed photos. Interestingly, it's designed to shoot 50MP stills as standard, able to eke out much better quality. Video quality is improved as well, and the phone is now able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision footage — albeit with the main camera and tele lens (wide-angle is limited to 4K60).</p><p>Let's get to the photos. Predictably, the Find X9 Pro does a fantastic job in just about any lighting scenario, delivering detailed photos with good dynamic range and color accuracy. OPPO says it worked closely with Sony and Hasselblad to tune both the sensor and its imaging algorithms this year, and there is a noticeable difference in the resultant image quality over the Find X8 Pro.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span

good as the main camera — it holds its own against the X300 Pro in this regard. The wide-angle lens is the only module that's holding the device back a little; it doesn't quite have the same tonal balance in challenging conditions, and doesn't measure up to the other two cameras.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3072px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="KkmnzsHt3xkr9ckBAkZtXY" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro camera testing in Shanghai, China" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KkmnzsHt3xkr9ckBAkZtXY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3072" height="4096" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ZaG7QSh5wCAEWwnemhW6SY" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro camera testing in Shanghai, China" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZaG7QSh5wCAEWwnemhW6SY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="EoKPmSUrj9xaCKq8jPLeCY" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro camera testing in Shanghai, China" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EoKPmSUrj9xaCKq8jPLeCY.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="7MGKE7gdR2iu8XTM3T4JCZ" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro camera testing in Shanghai, China" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7MGKE7gdR2iu8XTM3T4JCZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>There are no issues in low-light scenarios with the rest of the cameras, and the phone does a great job with portrait shots. This is one of the key reasons why I used the Vivo X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro so much over the course of 2025, and I'm glad to see both brands making positive strides with portrait mode on their latest devices.</p><p>Then there's the <del>telephoto extender</del> err, detachable zoom lens. OPPO went with a similar system as Vivo, but annoyingly, attaching the zoom lens covers up the entire camera island, so you can't use any other lens when it's in use. This isn't a limitation on the X300 Pro, and OPPO should consider tweaking the design with the next generation. The detachable lens does a great job extending the zoom range, and the resultant image quality is similar to that of the X300 Pro. But the associated hassle means I didn't use it anywhere as much as its Vivo sibling.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="v5QePMG2Tqd3PD85cqLSVM" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5QePMG2Tqd3PD85cqLSVM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I still think Vivo has the overall edge with the cameras; I prefer the brand's image tuning and color science, but it's solely a matter of choice.

That's changing now, with the phone maker confirming that it will use a 1.5K BOE display on the device.</p><p>At an initial glance, that may seem like a downgrade from the 2K panel used on the OnePlus 13, but OnePlus' Li Jie Louis <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/ttarticle/p/show?id=2309405222115321446526">took to Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gadgets360.com/mobiles/news/oneplus-15-display-resolution-downgrade-reason-specifications-features-9502611">Gadgets 360</a>) to clarify a few things. Basically, OnePlus wanted to increase the refresh rate to 165Hz on the phone, and that wasn't possible with a 2K panel. So instead of going with the standard 120Hz display, OnePlus chose to "upgrade" the panel.</p><p>The display is still made by BOE, and it should get the usual extras that have been a mainstay on OnePlus phones these last two years, including DC dimming and good color vibrancy. Although the panel resolution is lower, Louis indicated that the display is costlier this time.</p><p>Honestly, this isn't an issue. Having used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, I can't tell the difference between a 2K and 1.5K panel in regular use, and I like that the phone maker is instead offering higher refresh — that's something you can actually notice. In a similar vein, the phone has thinner bezels this time, and goes down to 1nit at night; these are tangible gains that make a difference in regular use.</p><p>Also, while OnePlus says this was done to switch to 165Hz, the real reason might have to do with its BBK siblings. Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro </a>and Find X9 Pro use 1.5K panels as well, and at the X300 launch event in Shanghai, Vivo talked extensively about how it partnered with BOE to set up a production line catered to its devices.</p><p>This is just conjecture on my part, but I believe the Find X9 Pro and the OnePlus 15 use a similar panel, and it wouldn't have been feasible to switch to a 2K resolution just for one device — which doesn't sell anywhere as much as its OPPO and Vivo siblings.</p><p>Anyway, the result is that the OnePlus 15 will have a 1.5K panel, and it shouldn't be an issue. If anything, it may even have better battery life on account of not having to drive quite as many pixels, and I'll take that any day over infinitesimal gains in resolution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states that this new AI button will appear at the top of search results when users are looking for a new smartwatch, clothes, or anything. "Help me decide" gets specific, offering its assistance when users are searching for similar products to their initial search, but haven't made a purchase.</p><p>The post adds that "help me decide" leverages Amazon's LLMs and AWS services "to understand what you need and why by looking at your shopping history and preferences." The AI does a little more work by surfacing the product's details to help inform your decision and digging through customer reviews to further that research.</p><p>When searching for products, users will notice a "help me decide" button at the top right of the results with golden stars. After tapping the button, the AI will run through its processes and finally deliver its result: a singular product recommendation. The AI will surface the product's image, name, rating, price, a brief description from the product's creator, and its AI-compiled "Customers say" box.</p><p>This is what's known as a "Top Pick" within the AI's new feature. However, if you're unsatisfied, Amazon states you can tap two other options: Budget Pick and Upgrade Pick, to see what else is possible.</p><h2 id="amazon-continues-to-bring-speed-with-ai-2">Amazon continues to bring speed with AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA" name="amazon-help-me-decide-top-pick" alt="Amazon's new AI feature, "help me decide," will connect users with products that they may be interested in, producing its image, title, rating, price, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bwJU9Lf68VefG7cbDVk5iA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon states "help me decide" is now available for users on Android and iOS in the app, as well as those shopping in mobile browsers. It states you can check if you have the feature by heading into "Keep shopping for" at the top of the app.</p><p>This feature is in a similar vein <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/amazon/amazon-buy-for-me-ai-agentic-test-start">to a test Amazon ran</a> earlier this spring. The company rolled out an AI test called "Buy for me," which allowed users to grant permission to the AI to purchase a product for them, without much manual input. It arrived for a limited group of U.S. testers and appeared when searching for products in the app. In short, tapping "buy for me" would let the AI immediately run through the usual payment processes, such as name, address, and card information.</p><p>It was an agentic test that leveraged Amazon's Bedrock AI software to handle everything for the user.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Buttons have to be at least 10ft/3m apart, but the trick is that you just need to walk that distance. It doesn't have to be a straight line.</p><p>I asked developer Thomas Van Bouwel about it, and he told me, "So, e.g., if you have a master bedroom with two nightstands, putting the buttons on the two nightstands and walking around the bed is valid." Remember, since the Meta Quest is a wireless VR console, you don't have any wires or cords to trip over, so you can go ham with the playspace size and shape.</p><p>The action begins fairly simply, with the first few levels involving static lasers that stay in one place, making it easy to get into character and slink your way around each laser to get to the end. As you can tell from the video above, those lasers don't stay in place for long, becoming much more like a traditional video game as you progress.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme" name="LaserDance_Screenshot_04" alt="Mixed reality gameplay of a man dodging laser in Laser Dance while wearing a Meta Quest 3S headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CJu9LkE6PVENDcVGSeumme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vanbo BV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I've had access to the game for a few days now and can call it another huge win for Vanbo games. If you're not familiar with the name, this is the same developer behind the uber-popular puzzle game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cubism-vr.com/">Cubism</a>, which is on every VR platform from the Meta Quest to the newly minted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung Galaxy XR</a>.</p><p>Plus, at just $9.99, it's nearly impossible to pass up. This might be called "early access," but it's got over 18 levels to play, all of which scale with your room size and shape and has over 80 laser patterns. That ensures even the same levels feel different when you play them in another room or home!</p><p>And if you've got some accessibility needs, don't worry, the game caters to a wide variety of players with significant adjustments where you might need them.

It sports a 10.9-inch LCD display (the lack of an OLED screen is part of why it's so much more affordable), as well as a large 8,000mAh battery, which Samsung says will get users up to 20 hours of battery life per charge. It also has a microSD slot for added storage, as well as IP68 ingress protection, Android 15, and a durable build quality that users like.</p><p>You can also purchase a first-party keyboard case for the S10 FE, though it's sold separately.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.99" data-dimension48="$499.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZYQT3T" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FLGRKLCi3NCGSTAP4LenpM" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-render-square" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLGRKLCi3NCGSTAP4LenpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="394" height="394" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Processor-Note-Taking-Manufacturer-Warranty/dp/B0DVZYQT3T" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$499.99" data-dimension48="$499.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$499.99</del> <strong>$399.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon is currently offering the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 FE for $100 off, marking a 20% discount.

It offers a cheaper price point than premium tablets in Samsung's repertoire, though it still comes with the first-party S Pen.

Still, the S10 FE also has a microSD port that allows for up to 1TB of expandable storage.

However, if you need features such as an OLED display, higher refresh rate, or premium-tier performance, you might want to consider a higher-end model.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Are there any drawbacks or things to consider before buying?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The display is LCD rather than OLED, so contrast and black levels won’t be as strong as premium tablets. If you want a really high refresh rate (e.g., 120Hz) or flagship-level performance, this model might fall short due to the Exynos chip and only 8GB of RAM. Finally, the deal is for the 128GB version; double-check which storage size you’re purchasing and ensure it's enough for your needs.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

This means that AI will become the primary feature on a phone, pulling information from apps to give users a more intuitive and personalized experience.</p><p>Much like how you can ask <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini</a> to summarize the recent emails from your manager about the 'Q4 marketing campaign' and add a task to your to-do list to draft a follow-up presentation for next week, Gemini will pretty much accomplish these tasks without much of your intervention. But this is still Gemini interacting with Google's apps. Now imagine if it could do the same with the rest of the apps on your phone?</p><p>In the future, AI will essentially function as the brain of your phone, with apps serving as its neurons, all working together to help you accomplish tasks. For instance, you could say, "Hey Google, could you plan my dinner for tonight, send me a shopping list of ingredients, and then book an Uber for 5 pm so I can get supplies right after my Pilates class?" and then simply observe as everything falls into place.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/euRgJMKNN78" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/exclusive-how-ai-will-transform-our-relationship-with-technology">IDC experts told Android Central in an exclusive report</a> that the existing App ecosystem will be forced to adapt. But if these models do change, how will AI determine which specific app to use for a given task? For example, if apps like Expedia or Airbnb are not installed, will the AI prioritize an app based on user history, performance, or a paid partnership? Here's what could likely happen.</p><p>"Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices," IDC notes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC" name="Gemini-Top-Free-App-iOS" alt="Gemini listed as the top iOS app with a Pixel in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yrkDUTqnrTUEAknS32XnEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>App developers and companies may not like the idea of losing autonomy over their products. "Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years," the firm added.</p><p>Ultimately, businesses that effectively use AI will thrive because people these days want things to happen quickly and on the go. And those who resist this change might be caught in an uphill battle. This switch in the overall business model could also let AI act as a filter, and could potentially change the need for users to interact with these apps directly.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And if your headphones don't support LDAC, which Pixels do, you're not getting the most out of your Pixel's audio streams.</p><p>There is a fix for that! New Bluetooth dongles from Sennheiser and Questyle are meant to bridge the gap between phones, tablets, gaming devices, and laptops/desktops that don’t support connecting to the best earbuds via the latest Bluetooth codecs.</p><p>I’m going to show you how to use those dongles to squeeze every drop of audio fidelity out of your device of choice!</p><h2 id="how-these-bluetooth-dongles-work-2">How these Bluetooth dongles work</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="6knWTkH7wkLCmrkp8QaazH" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-dime-scale.JPG" alt="A dime, surrounded by the Sennheiser BTD 700 and Questyle QCC Dongle Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6knWTkH7wkLCmrkp8QaazH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="zBnEJSgai95WCmMq7WuCbF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-retail-packaging.JPG" alt="Retail packaging for the Sennheiser BTD 700 and Questyle QCC Dongle Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zBnEJSgai95WCmMq7WuCbF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aeqKH6hAgFKGGXeBiCr49F" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-group-shot.JPG" alt="Sennheiser BTD 700 and Questyle QCC Dongle Pro on a desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aeqKH6hAgFKGGXeBiCr49F.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2u5eQCfYxci8eDgp9iNLYF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-surface-pro-qcc.JPG" alt="Questyle QCC Dongle Pro connected to a Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u5eQCfYxci8eDgp9iNLYF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>What is LE Audio, LC3, and Auracast?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/androids-september-update-brings-music-sharing-and-personalized-android-bots"><strong>How do I share Auracast streams from a Google Pixel 10?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx"><strong>What is aptX and its various "flavors?"</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Today, we’re taking a look at the Sennheiser BTD 700 and the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro Bluetooth transmitters, both of which were launched in 2025. These Bluetooth dongles bypass your device’s built-in Bluetooth chips to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">transmit the best audio</a> to your Bluetooth earbuds, headphones, or IEMs. That’s it. If you’re up on computer lingo, think of these transmitters as external “sound cards.”</p><p>I’ve been switching between the two dongles for a couple of weeks now, testing them with mobile devices, as well as a Surface Pro 11 and an iMac Pro. With a quirk here and there, I’ve found that they deliver on the promise of providing plug-and-play experiences.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="sZzdjSnk5We94dECLCocKF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-surface-pro-btd700.JPG" alt="Sennheiser BTD 700 connected to a Microsoft Surface Pro 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sZzdjSnk5We94dECLCocKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With each device, you get the transmitter in the box, along with a USB-A to Type-C adapter, allowing you to use it with a laptop, computer, or gaming device that doesn’t have USB-C ports. Other than documentation, that’s it. I’ve plugged both dongles into phones with cases on them, without any fit issues.</p><p>Each unit has a single status LED. For the BTD 700, take a picture of the menu page showing the LED status legend and save it to a folder in your gallery, since it doesn’t come with a smartphone or tablet companion app. It is quite easy to operate, though, as you simply need to press the button at the bottom of the dongle to change modes/codecs.</p><p>The QCC Dongle Pro has a mobile app, making it much easier to know which Bluetooth codec you’re using. It also shows you all of your paired Bluetooth devices.</p><h2 id="plug-and-played-2">Plug and played</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="2gkxbvorfVu7pxPeyiFDTF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-btd700-pixel9.JPG" alt="Sennheiser BTD 700 connected to a Google Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2gkxbvorfVu7pxPeyiFDTF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Android landscape is all over the place when it comes to Bluetooth support for the top-tier hi-res wireless aptX codecs, LDAC, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">LC3 with Auracast</a>.

The QCC Dongle Pro has only one LED color for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res codecs</a>, so you won’t know if you’re streaming aptX Lossless or LDAC, for example. You’ll need to look at the app for that.</p><p>Since the Sennheiser BTD 700 doesn't have a mobile app for pairing, you’ll have to put the dongle and listening device into pairing mode and just wait for them to connect.</p><p>The other thing to note is that almost any time you plug something into a smartphone or tablet's USB-C port other than a charging cable, you’re going to drain the battery faster. In this case, around 10% per hour. Keep that in mind for any long-haul travel, music, or movie-watching sessions.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="U9wZqAW8VbQQM5p6gYepRF" name="btd-700-qcc-dongle-pro-qcc-pixel9-led.JPG" alt="Questyle QCC Dongle Pro connected to a Google Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U9wZqAW8VbQQM5p6gYepRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Still, you really can't go wrong with either. It just depends on your needs. And at $60 for the Sennheiser BTD 700 and $99 for the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro, these aren't terribly difficult decisions to make! Note that if the Dongle Pro's pricing feels a bit steep and you don't need LDAC support, you can pick up the standard QCC Dongle for the same price as Sennheiser's.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f532d76f-f6d4-46e7-a020-7f37f02b2137">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7fXx8pvHUphuMmiwQrzJU.jpg' alt="Product render of the Questyle QCC Dongle Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Questyle QCC Dongle Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Small, but mighty!</strong></em></p><p>Supporting multiple flavors of Hi-Res Wirless Audio, the QCC Dongle Pro is a great way to get the most out of your phone and headphones' or earbuds' Bluetooth connection without spending the money to upgrade your phone.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cec3117c-6915-46d2-8342-1101174732bc">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vitFDSkSdxZE7SNANDx3LU.jpg' alt="Product render of the Sennheiser BTD 700"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Sennheiser BTD 700</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Broadcast to your buds!</strong></em></p><p>Not only does the BTD 700 give you access to top-tier aptX standards, but it comes with support for LE Audio, LC3 and Auracast, allowing you to share audio with a room full of people. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

The design is roughly the same, it doesn't feel any different in daily use, and if you're in Asia, you get a bigger 6,510mAh battery that should last two days between charges. The cameras get a predictable boost, and they manage to take better photos and videos than the X200 Pro, which is all the reason I need to switch to the X300 Pro as my daily driver going forward.</p><p>Oh, and Vivo is bringing the device to western markets, which is a definite positive. Do the upgrades allow the X300 Pro to stand out against its Chinese rivals? I believe so — I used the phone for just over ten days, and this is the best all-round camera available today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BeXjqo5i9P5bJ9QHRkfVJm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeXjqo5i9P5bJ9QHRkfVJm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X300 and X300 Pro at a launch event in Shanghai, China on October 13, with both phones on sale in the country.

I'll update once I have global pricing details, but for now, the X300 starts at CNY 4,399 ($617) in China, going up to CNY 5,799 ($814) for the 1TB configuration.</p><p>The X300 Pro starts at CNY 5,299 ($744) for the 12GB/256GB model, CNY 5,999 ($843) for the 16GB/512GB edition, and CNY 6,699 ($940) for the 16GB/1TB model. There's also a Photography Kit that's bundled with the phone this time, and it is identical to what we got on the X200 Ultra earlier this year. This model costs CNY 8,299 ($1,166), and is the only one that gets satellite connectivity.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X300 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED, 120Hz, 2800x1260, Dolby Vision, 4500 nits max</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OriginOS 6 based on Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 9500, 1 x 4.21 GHz C1-Ultra, 3 x 3.5 GHz C1-Premium, 4 x 2.7 GHz C1-Pro, G1-Ultra, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/1.28-inch f/1.6 Sony Lytia LYT-828, 24mm, 4K120 Dolby Vision video, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>200MP 1/1.4-inch f/2.7 Samsung HPB telephoto, 85mm, 3.7x optical zoom, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50MP 1/12.76-inch f/2.0 Samsung JN1, 15mm wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>50MP Samsung JN1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 global 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS, satellite connectivity (1TB model)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>6,510mAh silicon battery (5,440mAh in select regions), 90W charging, 40W wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>161.2 x 75.5 x 8mm, 226g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Brown, White, Black, Blue</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-design"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Design</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5NXMuxhFgfV4uPGEFpQwLm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5NXMuxhFgfV4uPGEFpQwLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/i-used-the-vivo-x300-and-x300-pro">noted in my X300 Pro hands-on</a>, Vivo didn't change the design too much.

All models get LPDDR5X memory and UFS 4.1 storage modules, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. There's good news on that side of things, with Vivo finally adding eSIM integration to the phone globally; this made an immediate difference as I was able to set up and use an eSIM while attending the phone's launch in China.</p><p>Otherwise, there were no issues making calls, connecting to my home network, or pairing a myriad of devices over Bluetooth.

The phone gets a 6,510mAh battery that's designed to last two days. There's just one problem — the variant I'm using has a smaller 5,440mAh battery instead.</p><p>While the rest of the hardware is unchanged, Vivo is using a smaller battery in the Austrian, German, and Hungarian models of the X300 Pro, and while I usually get the Asian unit of the device, I received the Austrian variant this time. Don't get me wrong; this phone lasts all day as well, but it doesn't measure up to the X200 Pro when it comes to battery longevity, and doesn't have the two-day battery that the Asian model gets.</p><p>That's annoying to say the least, and in my use, there were two days when I had to plug it in before turning in. Thankfully, it doesn't take too long to charge the phone thanks to 90W charging tech, and it even gets 50W USB PD charging, which is just easier. The downside is that there's no charger in the box; again, this isn't an issue everywhere, but the Austrian model doesn't have one. Vivo still provides a charger in Asia with the X300 and X300 Pro.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YuEVbeZBBQ82aeCn8Q4iBm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuEVbeZBBQ82aeCn8Q4iBm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to what Vivo did with MediaTek, the brand collaborated with Sony and Samsung over the imaging modules on the X300 Pro.

The X300 Pro is able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision footage, and video quality is noticeably better than previous years. The interface itself hasn't changed much, and you still get shooting modes at the bottom, along with all the toggles and effects. On that note, Zeiss integration is intact, and you get to choose between various modes — I went with Vivid.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

takes better photos than just about any other device I tested this year. Yes, the X200 Ultra technically does a better job, but the X300 Pro holds its own, and honestly, I prefer the latter. The wide-angle lens is decent enough in its own right, and the tele module is fantastic this year — it takes detailed shots at 10x without any hassle, and I got usable photos at 30x.</p><p>In short, the X300 Pro is my recommendation if you need the best cameras available today.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-software"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="odxc4x6cqRAsFtXsunntYm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/odxc4x6cqRAsFtXsunntYm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The X300 Pro sees the debut of OriginOS 6 globally, and it is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>. The software has a much more modern design, and it is a clear upgrade from Funtouch OS. What irks me a little is the similarities to iOS 26; the translucent effects and other design elements are heavily borrowed from the iPhone, and Vivo isn't the only brand doing this — all other Chinese phone makers are going this route.</p><p>There's no arguing that the software feels better to use on the X300 Pro. There's better uniformity to the UI as a whole, and Vivo did a good job with the smooth animations and transitions; they make interacting with the interface that much more enjoyable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tcCvNCVZTUj29yAHYBrCUm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tcCvNCVZTUj29yAHYBrCUm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But as with every new redesign, there are issues; pressing down on a suggested action in the notification pane pulls up the app instead, and I noticed errant crashes. These kinds of issues usually get addressed, and the kinks should be ironed out by the time the phone becomes available globally.</p><p>Like other brands, Vivo is switching to a split notification pane, but you thankfully get the ability to switch to the older unified option. The pane itself is a clear downgrade from the one on Funtouch OS; pulling down on a notification card doesn't expand it automatically, and you have to use the arrow to do so. Similar notifications are now stacked — just like iOS — and it's just as annoying here as on my iPhone.</p><p>There's good customizability as well, and Vivo essentially "emulated" what you get on iOS. You can set up the phone to look like a clone of an iPhone, and it's clear that this was an intentional move by the brand. I still don't get the allure of trying to mimic iOS — I'd much prefer if brands went all-in on Material You aesthetic instead — but it's evident that all Chinese phone makers just want to make their phones feel like iPhones again.</p><p>Coming to updates, Vivo guarantees four years of Android OS updates, which is on the lower end of the scale as these things go. But like its BBK siblings, it's unlikely Vivo will budge on this front, and the result is that the X300 Pro lags behind Google and Samsung devices when it comes to software updates.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x300-pro-the-alternatives"><span>Vivo X300 Pro: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Find X9 Pro is slated to make its global debut soon, with that device being the obvious alternative to the X300 Pro.

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-one-year-later">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Google finally listened to what the people wanted and introduced a larger 45mm option in addition to the petite 41mm size. Naturally, the Pixel Watch 4 continued the tradition, so it too comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes.</p><p>Since the very first Pixel Watch, Google has always used the same proprietary connector for its bands. Although I was very disappointed with this decision initially, I am not as angry with this decision anymore. Sure, it would have been nice to have a universal connector like the quick-release pins that almost every other smartwatch in the world uses. But now that we're a few generations in, there are plenty of Pixel Watch bands to choose from, even if they use a different connector. That was my main source of frustration; the connector is perfectly functional otherwise.</p><p>Every single Pixel Watch band can be used on every single Pixel Watch model, as long as you have the 41mm size. If you opted for the larger 45mm size on your Pixel Watch 3 or Watch 4, then you can only use the 45mm bands made for both watches on either model. I still have my original Pixel Watch Active Band in Hazel, and it fits the 41mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-early-impressions">Pixel Watch 4</a> perfectly.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/third-pixel-watch-still-doesnt-have-good-third-party-bands">third-party options still pale</a> in comparison to alternatives like the Galaxy Watch 8 or the Amazfit Balance 2, but Google has since expanded its own range of Pixel Watch bands considerably. Then there are brands like Spigen, which offer decent, affordable straps that fit the Pixel Watch connector well. I myself use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Designed-Google-Pixel-Watch/dp/B0C91HRWZN/">Spigen Lite Fit</a> stretchy nylon band on a daily basis. For formals, metal bands like the link, mesh, or slim ones from Google are excellent options.</p><p>So if you're using the Pixel Watch 4, there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/watch-bands/best-google-pixel-watch-4-bands">plenty of diverse watch bands</a> that you can buy, including straps made of fabric, metal, and fluoroelastomer.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="57abfd46-68d4-4f29-a2aa-86fb5be2a9e4">            <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/watch_band_metal_link" data-model-name="Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H6AocMdqKZMqceKZiX8wQN.jpg' alt="Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Time for an upgrade</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel Watch Metal Links Band is a timeless metal links band that immediately smartens up your Pixel Watch 4.

Much like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/samsung-perplexity-ai-tv-experience-thats-more-than-just-shows">Samsung just announced its partnership</a> with Perplexity on its TVs, which allows users to look up shows, movies, and even plan trips with the AI right from their couch.</p><p>Companies like Google and Motorola have been marketing the AI experience on their new phones, more than the actual device itself, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/what-to-expect-from-nothings-ambitious-ai-native-os-and-its-expansion-into-new-devices">Nothing is also putting its $200M</a> funding to create its own AI-native devices. This means, slowly yet steadily, we see a shift in the industry, where it is no longer about the hardware; we've entered an era where the experience with the device matters more than its looks.</p><p>And if this device can communicate with a bunch of apps on your phone with just a voice command, to help you reserve a table at your favorite restaurant, send invites to the guests, and also block your calendar, all in one. This would basically eliminate the need to open up multiple apps, significantly reducing the time spent on these tasks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW" name="Motorola-Edge-2025-Moto-AI-catch-me-up-01" alt="Moto AI running on a Motorola Edge 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ycdkR38ux8uZtf9BbP6sBW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the near future, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-will-your-phone-look-like-in-2035-it-wont-even-leave-your-pocket">the phone will serve as a central hub</a>, functioning as a remote to communicate with other smart devices integrated with AI. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/exclusive-how-ai-will-transform-our-relationship-with-technology">recent report by IDC</a>, this changed only two years ago when GenAI began appearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>.

This will basically allow GenAI to pick the device that is most suited for the task at hand, for instance, if you have to move seamlessly from your phone to your headphones or car dashboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9" name="Android-Auto-Gemini-Live" alt="Gemini Live and Google Maps on Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xQRmeR59cPHuA8WR5yMt9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Devices like AI-powered smart glasses are also contributing to this shift, offering hands-free, real-time assistance, as they can basically see and hear everything the user does.

Each phone has its own unique dimensions, so you can't use any of the cases meant for a single model with another interchangeably.</p><p>It's understandable why a lot of people might wonder whether they can use their Pixel 9 Pro Fold case on the latest Pixel foldable. After all, they seem to share identical sizes and have the same dual-camera bars. However, Google tweaked the measurements a tad with the newest Pixel Fold iteration. Subtle changes in the camera bar placement and size, as well as the entire foldable phone itself, make it impossible to reuse last-gen cases on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 9 Pro Fold</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folded</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 77.1 x 10.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Unfolded</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2 mm</p></td><td  ><p>155.2 x 150.2 x 5.1 mm</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1mw7ol1/pixel_9_pro_case_fit_the_pixel_10/">Reddit users have reported</a> that they were able to use Pixel 9 Pro Fold cases on their Pixel 10 Pro Fold units, but the fit isn't perfect. The camera bar and speaker alignments are off. This affects the drop-proofing added by a phone case, defeating the purpose of using a phone case in the first place.</p><p>Purchasing a case along with your new phone is the best way to go, but sometimes shipments don't arrive in time. Thus, you should only resort to using an incompatible case as a temporary solution while you wait for your Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold case to be delivered.</p><p>Poor fit and lack of impact resistance aside, another issue with using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Pixel 9 Pro Fold case</a> is that you miss out on Pixelsnap compatibility.

The company has announced that it's testing AI-powered smart glasses specifically developed for its delivery associates.</p><p>In a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/smart-glasses-amazon-delivery-drivers?ref=uploadvr.com&tag=upload01-20">blog post</a>, Amazon revealed that these glasses, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> that are for all users, are designed to support delivery associates to make deliveries "safer and more seamless." According to Amazon, they allow associates to scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery — all without using their phones.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> are equipped with cameras, computer vision, and AI-powered sensing capabilities. The feature has a fixed green monochrome heads-up display that shows the package details to the delivery associate directly in their field of view.</p><h2 id="amazon-s-ai-glasses-aim-to-ease-delivery-work-2">Amazon's AI glasses aim to ease delivery work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU" name="amazon-smart-delivery-glasses" alt="Amazon's AI smart glasses for Delivery Associates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnJy4t4BzU4R7s9kTWAVhU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When a delivery driver parks, the glasses automatically activate and display package details, helping them locate the correct parcel in their vehicles to the corresponding homes. After that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/level-up-your-tech-game-with-20-percent-off-these-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> then show turn-by-turn navigation to guide the delivery partner to the exact location.</p><p>The glasses are operated by a small controller worn in the delivery vest and powered by a swappable battery for "all-day use." Amazon also says the glasses support prescription lenses and ones that automatically adjust to surrounding light.</p><p>The company adds that it has tested earlier versions of the smart glasses with delivery partners to collect crucial feedback and improve the design. It also mentioned that a "future version" may detect issues — such as if a package is dropped at the wrong doorstep — and even notify the partner if there's a pet in the yard.</p><p>For now, Amazon hasn't revealed when it will fully deploy these smart glasses across its delivery fleet, but a previous report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-reportedly-working-on-echo-hud-glasses/">The Information</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/amazon-building-hud-glasses-for-delivery-drivers/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=threads">UploadVR</a>) suggested that Amazon plans to roll out driver glasses by mid-2026, with an initial production of about 100,000 units.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google is finally making that process easier by selling replacement earbuds, eartips, and charging cases for the Pixel Buds directly through its online store.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/22/pixel-buds-2a-pro-2-replacement/">9to5Google</a>, the Google Store now lists replacement parts for the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>. That means if you misplace one earbud, drop it in water, or your case starts malfunctioning, you can now buy those specific parts directly from Google without having to go through support.</p><p>Previously, users had to go through a lengthy self-service repair process on Google's website to order replacement parts, which often took days and involved multiple steps. Now, you can simply go to the online store, choose the part you need, and buy it straight away.</p><p>For the Pixel Buds Pro 2, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_earbuds?hl=en-US">replacement earbuds</a> cost $70, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_pro_2_case?hl=en-US">charging case</a> costs $95. They're available in Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony, though the new Moonstone color is currently unavailable. For the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-buds-2a-announced">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, both the earbuds and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_case?hl=en-US">case</a> cost $55 each, while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/replacement_pixel_buds_2a_eartip_set?hl=en-US">replacement eartips</a> for both earbuds are priced at $20.</p><h2 id="replacement-parts-are-now-just-a-click-away-2">Replacement parts are now just a click away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ" name="pixel-buds-replacement-parts" alt="Replacement Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 parts on Google Store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8cuHCkWQym8z8oUxEvr6WQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google notes that replacements may not always be available in all regions or at all times. At the time of writing, eartips for the Pixel Buds 2a are already out of stock. It's worth noting that at the time of purchasing, you can also specify whether you want the left or right earbud replaced.</p><p>This move aligns with Google's growing emphasis on repairability and sustainability across its product lineup. The company recently highlighted that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> are easier to repair than ever before and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/get-pixel-repaired-half-price-oct-2025">hosted a repair education session</a> at its New York store last week to promote the effort.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, Google has also made it possible to replace the charging case battery, something that wasn't possible with the previous generation Pixel Buds. And now, replacement parts are available for the rest of the earbuds too — though you might want to wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a>, where a full pair of Pixel Buds might cost nearly the same as these replacement parts.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224477353054299" target="_blank">Ice Universe on Weibo</a> (translated) says "the release of the Samsung Galaxy S26 series has been postponed." There are no other details in the post explaining a potential cause for the holdups, or when the lineup might now release.</p><p>The post, first shared on Tuesday, Oct. 22, came just minutes after the leaker Instant Digital also shared news of the rumored Galaxy S26 delay <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5224475520925890" target="_blank">on Weibo</a> (translated): "In order to present it better to everyone, the release of the Galaxy S26 series may be postponed to March for release."</p><p>As the Galaxy S26 is still in the rumor phase and Samsung hasn't confirmed anything yet, we don't officially know when its next lineup of flagship phones might release. The Samsung Galaxy S25 was announced in January 2025 and became generally available for purchase the following month.

The upgrade is seemingly designed to give the Pixel's AOD a little more smarts when it comes to whether or not the user is around to interact with it.</p><p>Rahman states that the newest Canary build features a new string with the following on-device description: "power down the display when no user activity is detected to save power."</p><p>As Rahman reiterates, Google Pixels already turn off the AOD if your phone is in your pocket or if flipped over (screen down). What "activity" could mean in this case could involve a couple of things. As Rahman mentions, perhaps the Pixel's proximity sensor could come into greater effect here, to determine if the user is near their phone and moving around, or whatever the case may be. Moreover, tracking the user's "activity" could also mean whether or not they've picked up their device to check a notification or not in a while.</p><p>There's no hiding the fact that the AOD can severely drain your battery, which is why Google is supposedly working on this new option. If users left the room, but left their Pixel's AOD on for a while, it'll shut off, saving them from returning to a nearly dead phone.</p><h2 id="refining-the-pixel-2">Refining the Pixel</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-white-back-11" alt="A white Google Pixel 10 Pro XL on a latticework black chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xoYNUpVZSvwfBKGUhj8XwU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google revealed its Android Canary channel during the summer, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">as an avenue for developers</a> to step into the core of its API development.

The back of the tablet is made out of polycarbonate, and while I would've preferred metal, I didn't see any problems with build quality. And at 508g, the tablet isn't so heavy that it's uncomfortable to hold, and I had no problems in regular use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="K8BitT3STG5QLE7GUWPU4N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8BitT3STG5QLE7GUWPU4N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The front camera is integrated into the bezel, and honestly, it isn't even visible in regular use — it's only when you squint right at it that you can make out that it's there. The camera quality is decent enough, although admittedly I only use it while attending briefings. Interestingly, you get two cameras at the back — a 50MP main lens and 8MP wide-angle — and as a result, the rear camera module is bigger than most other tablets.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mMTGmuKgDXgeVdWsQ9b53N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A tablet needs good accessories, and the reason why I'm now using the Xiaomi Pad Mini to control my smart home is because of the custom case and stylus. Huawei does a great job in this area, and the MatePad Pro 12.2-inch comes with a keyboard and stylus as standard. The Glide Keyboard connects using Huawei's NearLink protocol, and it has a cubby to store the stylus. On that note, Huawei doesn't bundle the M-Pencil 3 stylus, but sells it as a free add-on when you buy the tablet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5076px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBSUXipKVVpq9Jib2XD2wM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5076" height="2859" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The keyboard is great to use; the keys have good travel, you get a large touchpad, and it doesn't add much bulk to the tablet as a whole.

While there isn't a charger bundled with the tablet, it uses Huawei's 100W standard, and it takes just over an hour to charge the battery.</p><h2 id="no-google-no-problem-2">No Google, no problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN" name="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025" alt="Huawei MatePad Pro 12.2 2025 on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gWBQ85E8y4aYtzenQ2yULN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's the software where things diverge from traditional Android tablets. The MatePad Pro doesn't have Google Mobile Services, so you don't get the Play Store, Gmail, Chrome, or YouTube pre-installed. While that is annoying, it's extremely easy to get these apps installed via GBox — doing so takes under five minutes. Once they're installed, they're sandboxed within GBox, but I didn't see any difference in usability.</p><p>The tablet runs HarmonyOS 4.3 out of the box, and it is similar enough to EMUI that there isn't a learning curve. If anything, the software is nearly identical to what Honor has on its tablets — make of that what you will.

Rolling out today, users can "set a daily limit" for how long the YouTube app on mobile will allow them to scroll through Shorts. The post states this option will appear in the app's Settings once the update arrives.</p><p>YouTube says that once users reach their daily limit, the app will inform them via a "dismissible" notification indicating their Shorts feed will be "paused" until the following day.</p><p>Users can look at this as a sort of "digital wellbeing" update for YouTube's Shorts, as the post highlights the intent behind encouraging better viewing habits/time management. While older users can utilize this to help manage themselves, YouTube says it will bring this to parents "later this year."</p><p>When this update arrives, parents will be able to set a daily limit on Shorts viewing for kid and teen accounts that they supervise. However, the main difference here is that the alerts for younger users will be "non-dismissible." Parents will be able to activate and set a daily limit for their children at will, and disable it, if desired, all the same.</p><h2 id="shorts-are-popular-2">Shorts are popular</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf" name="YouTube-Shorts-hero.jpg" alt="YouTube Shorts logo on a mobile phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oU5namDbUAVCZENPFa4Wrf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it's up to the user to decide whether or not they need a "daily limit," it's clear that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-shorts-five-trillion-total-views">YouTube's Shorts are extremely popular</a>. Less than two years after the platform debuted its short-form content, it reported that Shorts had already surpassed five trillion views. This number was achieved across multiple platforms, such as Android phones and laptops.</p><p>While Shorts proved quite popular, YouTube was already looking into ways to help short-form content creators gain more revenue.</p><p>On a related note, it also sought ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-starts-rolling-out-shoppable-video-ads-worldwide">push the shopping experience</a> to people watching Shorts. These videos gained shoppable ads, designed to help advertisers bring their product closer to viewers, in an attempt to, of course, get them to buy that new dress or shirt or pair of shoes.

A Pixel 8 owner from Germany chimed in, reporting similar problems.</p><p>Spotify has offered that users can cleanly reinstall the app on their devices, but that hasn't reportedly helped.

The post states that this week, owners of a 2025 Samsung TV will find the new Perplexity AI app available on their set. As an incentive, Perplexity is offering a 12-month subscription to its Pro plan for free after scanning the QR code in the app.</p><p>Samsung states the Perplexity AI app for its TVs is the first of its kind, seeking to deliver "smart, generative AI support to the largest communal screens."</p><p>Ryan Foutty, vice president of business at Perplexity, states, "Curiosity can strike at any time. Perplexity’s mission is to serve the world’s curiosity by bridging the gap between traditional search and innovative AI-driven interfaces." In the name of "curiosity," the Perplexity AI app on Samsung's TVs can reportedly help viewers with queries ranging from simple questions to new shows they might enjoy.</p><p>The post states users can get specific, asking Perplexity AI about "movies directed by the Russo Brothers." Additionally, you can ask the AI to help you plan a trip, if you'd like, without reaching for your phone.</p><h2 id="the-tv-is-the-place-to-be-2">The TV is the place to be</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG" name="samsung-tv-perplexity-ai-launch" alt="Samsung and Perplexity join hands to bring a Perplexity AI app for the 2025 TV experience." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6JQ4RhxgmSQGi3mDW3YyhG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Perplexity AI app should be available on your 2025 Samsung TV home screen. Samsung says you can navigate to the Apps Tab to find it and, if it isn't there, check the Vision AI companion (press the AI Button on your remote). Users can agree to let the AI access their remote microphone, or they can use the on-screen keyboard.</p><p>While only this year's TVs from Samsung get in the fun, that won't last long, as the brand's 2023 and 2024 and set to receive the app, too. However, consumers with TVs from the past two generations will have to wait for an OS upgrade set for "later this year."</p><p>Samsung's been looking to enhance the TV experience since the year started, as it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/google-samsung-come-together-to-introduce-eclipsa-audio">announced a partnership with Google</a> for spatial audio. The two companies stated earlier this year that they were working to create an open-source spatial audio format called "Eclipsa Audio." The purpose of this format was to bring this technology reliably to more people, as well as creators.</p><p>Samsung was preparing to bring it to its consumers later this year (around Q3/Q4) on its TVs, soundbars, while Google sought to expand it to Chrome browsers and YouTube videos.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This particular deal is for the 512GB storage version of the device, and for the Pantone Scarab color.

However, if that isn't a dealbreaker for you, $900 or $1,000 is a pretty solid price on this phone, so it's definitely worth considering.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And while those are all phenomenal reasons to get a Galaxy XR this year, the real “secret sauce” is the software platform that powers everything.</p><p>That's because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>, the operating system running the show, does several things better than any OS before it. Google has taken its time to learn from the mistakes Meta and Apple have made thus far and has designed a brand new version of Android that's changing the paradigm for how an XR headset works.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Since the beginning, the Meta Quest family of devices has primarily been gaming consoles, with apps and non-gaming applications coming second. Meta tried to convince developers that porting their Android apps over to the Quest would be a worthwhile venture, but 99% of Android developers simply didn't answer the call.</p><p>Apple tried to prevent this by building the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-launch-sales-success">Vision Pro</a> to support iOS apps, but the company made a vital mistake in this implementation: it allowed developers to <em>opt out</em> of support for Vision Pro even though iOS apps can run just fine on the headset. This meant thousands of apps haven't supported the headset from day one.</p><p>But Google and Samsung are doing things differently. <em>Every single</em> Google Play app works on Galaxy XR from day one, meaning there's no need for developers to do anything to make their apps work on the headset. That also means that, unlike with Vision Pro, Galaxy XR buyers don't have to worry about their favorite apps likely never making their way to Samsung's headset. They're all there, and they work gloriously.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf" name="Android-XR-infinite-desktop" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5qhEdSGH8kVnjNEpbr7Sf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some apps have even received substantial built-for-XR upgrades, like Google Maps, YouTube, Google Meet, Chrome, Calm, Fox Sports, MLB, HBO Max, Netflix, and more.</p><p>To help find and juggle all those apps, Google has built Android XR with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> integration from day one. This doesn't just mean the usual AI stuff we've become accustomed to on our phones; it means wholly new paradigms of app interaction.</p><p>So while you certainly can say “Hey Google, open Maps” or something equally pedestrian, Gemini is built to actually <em>interact</em> with the apps and windows on your screen and anything you see through the Galaxy XR’s high-resolution external cameras. So if you've got a bunch of apps open on your headset and are getting overwhelmed, you can ask Gemini to organize the windows, and it'll intelligently arrange them <strong>instantly</strong>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nxuFMJF3BJrHA62DcyLxTf" name="Android-XR-circle-to-search-chrome" alt="A mock-up of Android XR showing floating Chrome screens in a mixed-reality space, visible on top of a living room.

I'm not saying you should use this to do your homework, but if companies are trying to convince people to do their jobs using AI, why not homework, too?</p><p>Apple may have pioneered eye-tracking-based UI navigation, but Google's brilliant implementation of Gemini to act more like a virtual secretary (or even a maid) means you can sit back and relax more often and enjoy all of the great things Galaxy XR has to offer. These two big things — apps and Gemini — have transformed the entire XR experience and made it feel like a profound new way to do all of the things you love.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Samsung isn't positioning this as a gaming console the way Meta is, but the headset still features several popular VR games and is slated to get a whole lot more.

XR is smartly using a rigid strap similar to the Meta Quest Pro instead of the uncomfortable cloth strap used on the Apple Vision Pro. This helps better distribute weight and provide stability across your head, complete with a nice thick pad along the back of the cranium.</p><p>The strap's size can be quickly adjusted via a dial on the back, similar to Meta Quest Pro or the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">Meta Quest 3 accessories</a>. A generous forehead pad keeps all the weight spaced out between the user's forehead and the cushion on the back of the head for maximum comfort.</p><p>That also means there's no weight placed on a user's face at all, a significant improvement to Apple's face-heavy design. Samsung is keeping the battery as a tethered accessory instead of packing it into the headset, ensuring that it weighs as little as possible. Thankfully, you can charge the battery pack while using the headset, potentially adding unlimited time to the estimated 2.5-hour battery life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-with-case-and-controllers" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, carrying case, and controllers sitting on four separate plastic pedestals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qTQnUuowCKwjxbCTzqzvnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Hidden behind the gorgeous glass front is a set of six tracking cameras, two high-resolution passthrough cameras, one depth sensor, and one flicker sensor.

Mixed-reality passthrough will enable apps that sit on virtual screens within your real living room, letting you see the world around you while still using virtual apps. It's all powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-announcement">Android XR</a>,  a new version of Android that Google says is "the first Android platform built entirely for the Gemini era."</p><p>This means that the entire UI can be controlled via multimodal input, including eye tracking, hand tracking, controllers, and voice input. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> has full power over the experience and can do virtually anything you need it to do, helping to change the paradigm of how we interact with mixed-reality apps. You can even ask Gemini to organize the windows of apps you have running, making it a very powerful organizational tool.</p><p>When Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p9BtBd-Al8">revealed it on stage</a>, the company said, "You can talk to your device as if you were talking to someone in the physical world." This is because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini can see what you see and hear what you hear</a>, including using the cameras on the headset to help identify things around you. This means you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">circle to search</a> for things using your hands, so it's easy to find great cooking recipes and cook hands-free, for example.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j" name="Headset_GooglePhotos-project-moohan-android-xr" alt="Running Google Photos in mixed reality on Samsung Project Moohan, powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RfgxtFQxgSCTz5o6LSq3j.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's XR OS could take a similar approach to VisionOS.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a surprise move, Google confirmed that <em>all</em> Android apps on the Google Play Store will work on Galaxy XR from day one. That's a massive leg-up on both Apple and Meta, as it means all your favorite apps already work on Samsung's new headset.</p><p>Google touts many of its apps running on Galaxy XR, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, Google Maps, YouTube, Chrome, and others. The headset works for both entertainment and productivity thanks to its hardware design, which allows for high-quality immersive and mixed-reality experiences alike.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r0AyzvfTRLo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Apps like YouTube can be run in a floating window or in fully immersive theater mode. Better yet, the headset is capable of enhancing 2D videos by adding a convincing layer of 3D depth using onboard AI. In our hands-on, Michael Hicks noted that "while Galaxy XR's hardware is impressive, I wouldn't be as excited for the headset if it weren't for unique Android XR tricks like this."</p><p>While browsing the web, you can pull Chrome tabs off the main window and place them in a floating window, giving you "unlimited monitors" to work on, no matter where you're working from.</p><p>Beyond comparisons to existing headsets, Google hopes to pave a new way to the future through communication with Gemini. Since Gemini can see and hear everything in the real <em>and</em> virtual worlds, it has a significant advantage over Apple's Siri in the Vision Pro and Meta AI in the Quest 3.</p><p>This allows you to have a conversation with Google about what's happening in any app you're using, as well as the room around you, melding the two together in a way that we simply have not seen before.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_r8MV0GkQE?start=207" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google showed off a brief Gemini on Android XR showcase during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/the-android-show-i-o-special-live-blog-everything-coming-to-android-16">The Android Show</a> on May 13, 2025. This particular demo showed off how Gemini can be used to search for information, but it doesn't work exactly like you're used to. Instead of just pulling up the search results on a single browser tab, Gemini can open multiple applications at a time and give you extensive information with a single query.</p><p>In the example, the person was researching vacation options and Gemini was able to pull up Google Maps, YouTube videos, and even assemble a draft itinerary in Google Docs, all on "the infinite screen," as the presenter called it. This lets you "create an itinerary in minutes" with tons of useful information at your fingertips instead of needing to cycle through multiple apps on a tiny phone screen.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b2ccf917-5bec-4204-85f6-a8c63b1fcc3b">            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/xr/galaxy-xr/galaxy-xr/buy/galaxy-xr-256gb-silver-shadow-wi-fi-sm-i610nzsaxar/" data-model-name="Samsung Galaxy XR" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:66.67%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS.jpg' alt="Galaxy XR front view"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The most cutting-edge XR headset ever made is here, and it runs all Google Play apps in a new version of Android called Android XR.

In the future, this could be a thing of the past. You could theoretically say “Hey Google, can you plan out my dinner tonight and send me a shopping list of things I need to get. Then book an Uber for 5 pm, so I can go get supplies right after my Pilates class.”</p><p>Whatever device is near you would pick up on your request and make it happen, with very little interaction from you. Basically, AI will be more than just the apps on your phone; it will be the driving force behind how you interact with your devices.</p><p>We’ve seen examples of this already; Motorola showed off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-is-testing-ai-that-skips-words-and-gets-straight-to-doing-what-you-ask">Large Action Model</a>, which takes what it knows about you and performs actions with little to no involvement from you —ordering your favorite beverage from a local shop you frequent, for example. Google has also enabled more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shopping-highlights-upgraded-ai-clothing-makeup">agentic capabilities within products like Chrome</a> that lets it work in the background to complete certain tasks like shopping for groceries.</p><div class="looped-video"><video class="lazyload-in-view lazyloading" data-src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline src="https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MainVid_InstaCart_1.mp4"></video></div><p>Qualcomm recently shared a vision of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-and-qualcomm-finally-realize-what-ai-is-for">what an agentic and interconnected future looks like</a>, moving seamlessly from one device to another through AI, and we’re getting closer to that future. This means that no matter what device you use, what AI service you interact with, AI will be more accessible to consumers.</p><p>And while today's consumers aren’t necessarily buying phones for just the AI, companies are becoming aware that a growing number of consumers want AI that can actually help them and make their lives easier. Google has demonstrated as much with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10</a>. If you look at any Pixel 10 ad, you will notice that the focus is on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> and how it helps users. Almost nothing is said about the actual phone. This shows that AI is slowly but surely becoming a driving force that will shape consumer spending.</p><p>Here’s IDC’s exclusive take on how AI will shape the future of technology.</p><p><strong>— Shruti Shekar, Editor in Chief</strong></p><p><strong>— Derrek Lee, Managing Editor</strong></p><h2 id="ai-in-the-mobile-world-where-we-are-and-where-we-re-headed-2">AI in the mobile world: Where we are and where we’re headed</h2><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been quietly shaping the smartphone experience for years. From computational photography to natural language processing, AI has long been embedded in our mobile lives—enhancing photos, powering voice assistants, and optimizing performance. But the recent rise of Generative AI (GenAI) marks a new chapter that promises to redefine how we interact with our devices, and even how we choose them.</p><h2 id="ai-s-quiet-beginnings-in-mobile-2">AI’s quiet beginnings in mobile</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E2Ym3FmaJDtZHuz8fKJLvk" name="Google-Pixel-Call-Screen.jpg" alt="Phone call being screened on a Pixel phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E2Ym3FmaJDtZHuz8fKJLvk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before GenAI and now Agentic AI became buzzwords, AI in smartphones was largely invisible to the average user. It worked behind the scenes — improving battery life, enhancing camera performance, and enabling smarter voice interactions. These features were valuable, but rarely marketed as “AI-powered.” Instead, they were sold as better user experiences.</p><p>This changed roughly two years ago when GenAI began appearing in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium smartphones</a>. With capabilities like real-time image editing, personalized content creation, and advanced voice interactions, oftentimes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, low-latency processing. GenAI brought AI to the forefront, but its reach was limited.</p><p>According to IDC’s Spring 2025 U.S. consumer survey, only 10.9% of respondents said they owned an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-ai-phones">AI smartphone</a>. This is unsurprising given that GenAI was mostly confined to flagship devices. However, it does indicate that the runway for growth is long.</p><h2 id="consumer-interest-is-building-2">Consumer interest is building</h2><p>IDC’s survey also asked those who didn’t own an AI smartphone about their interest in the category. The results were telling: 47.1% said they would consider purchasing one in the future. That's a strong indicator for adoption later on, especially as consumers tend to replace their smartphones once every 3 to 5 years.</p><p>In another 2025 IDC survey from Asia Pacific, 63.5% of respondents said that AI features were somewhat important/very important when purchasing a smartphone, once again underscoring stronger-than-average future interest. However, against the backdrop of other feature considerations, AI took a back seat behind price, brand, and user friendliness.</p><p>Historically, these have been the leading factors when deciding on a new smartphone and have not changed even with the advent of AI. Meanwhile, AI finished outside of the top five most important features.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h-XbeLZag-k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>This leads us to believe that AI is a tough sell when marketed as a concept, for now. AI in smartphones isn’t a raw spec, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">a suite of intelligent features</a> to provide a superior user experience. Consumers don’t walk into stores asking for an “AI phone.” Rather, they do ask for AI-powered features.</p><p>Take Google Pixel’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser</a>, for example. It allows users to remove unwanted objects from photos with a tap. It’s a clear, tangible benefit powered by AI, and consumers ask for such features when purchasing new devices. From PCs to mobile phones, a number of users are using AI-powered features such as chatbots, AI assistants, photo/video editing, writing/editing content, translation, and so on.</p><p>It's features like these that propel the market. By the end of 2025, IDC expects vendors to ship over 370 million GenAI-enabled smartphones worldwide, a 62.5% increase from the nearly 230 million shipped last year, and this grows further in 2026, with volumes surpassing 500 million. This surge means AI is moving beyond premium devices and into the mainstream.</p><h2 id="business-models-will-be-forced-to-evolve-2">Business models will be forced to evolve </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-24" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4MyfKY3AaBwbdhzX2doN3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To support this shift, business models will also need to evolve. Today, many phones are subsidized through pre-installed apps such as bloatware from telcos, third-party app stores, and apps or offers for cloud services. But as AI changes how users interact with their phones, these models may become obsolete.</p><p>We've all seen examples where you ask AI to plan a trip and it handles everything, including booking flights, hotels, creating itineraries, and sending calendar invites, all without opening a single app. But this raises a key question: which services does the AI choose to complete these tasks? If apps like Expedia or Airbnb aren’t installed, does the AI default to one based on user history, performance, or a behind-the-scenes partnership?</p><p>Strategic partnerships between service providers, phone makers, and AI platforms are likely to be formed, and we can expect this kind of integration to become more common over the next five years as AI matures and becomes ubiquitous across devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ" name="oneplus-13-oxygen-os-16-plus-mind-summary" alt="Looking through a summary of gym notes stored in Plus Mind in OxygenOS 16 on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PZXr3PzafMr7GowoVSXZwQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, this transition won't be easy. As AI becomes the central interface, the traditional app-based business model will face significant disruption. Today, apps and services compete for user attention and strive to own the customer experience. Many will resist handing over control to AI platforms, fearing the loss of direct engagement and brand identity, and will try to maintain their own ecosystems and monetization strategies over the next few years.</p><p>But in the long term, those that integrate best with AI will thrive as consumers often prioritize convenience and efficiency. This also positions AI as the gatekeeper as it chooses which service to use and shifts the customer relationship from the app to the AI.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2831px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Ecosystem-of-You.JPG" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "Ecosystem of you" on a screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZgCCLNgjtp9wizx9HgS9U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2831" height="1593" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the platform players, AI is becoming an extension of the OS, although with various flavors of AI, there is some degree of fragmentation. Apps, services, and potentially even device makers will need to rethink how they engage users, possibly moving toward API-first models that allow AI platforms to access their services directly or by partnering with AI providers to curate unique experiences.</p><p>Those who resist may find themselves sidelined, while those who embrace AI integration will become part of the new mobile paradigm.</p><p>What's the impact on consumers? Prices of AI smartphones are expected to come down from an average selling price of $1053 in 2024 to $786 in 2026. But the AI itself won't be cheap, as all the top companies in this space are eager to monetize their investments through subscriptions, advertising, or other means.</p><p><strong>Apps to actions</strong></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3749px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5" name="Moto-AI-LAM-Starbucks-Lenovo-Tech-World-2024-5.jpg" alt="Moto AI features demonstrated on a phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrHL9Mb3vp3orerrzXJoc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3749" height="2109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A decade from now, AI won’t just be a feature; it will be the primary interface across a wide range of devices. Smartphones will still play a central role, but they’ll be part of a broader ecosystem of smart glasses, headphones, wearables, and other ambient devices. Consumers will interact with the same AI across these form factors, customized and personalized for each user, choosing the most appropriate device for the task at hand or perhaps letting the AI do so.</p><p>This marks a shift from today’s app-centric experience to a task-centric one. Instead of opening individual apps to complete a task, users will simply ask their AI to “plan a trip,” “book a cab,” or “<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-google-photos-ai-editing-tools">edit a photo</a>,” and the AI will orchestrate everything behind the scenes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc" name="rabbit-r1-spotify.jpg" alt="Spotify playing on the Rabbit R1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B9kkdUCwH7ZFJRViskGDqc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are early versions of this today. Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> attempted to create such interactions. But such devices and interfaces lack polish and are held back by deep integrations into the OS, apps, and services.</p><p>There are already rumors that Google is working on a more deeply integrated version of Gemini, one that could take control of apps and execute tasks on behalf of users. If true, this would be a major leap toward a unified AI experience that spans devices and services seamlessly. But it also means that Google has to rethink how it monetizes Android, and its partners need to figure out if Gemini aids or hinders their own business models.</p><p>In this future, the form factor becomes secondary. Whether you're wearing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, using earbuds, or holding a phone, the experience will be consistent, intelligent, and personalized. The AI will know your preferences, context, and history, enabling it to act proactively and intuitively.</p><h2 id="selling-ai-through-experience-2">Selling AI through experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The future of mobile AI isn’t about selling “AI phones.” It’s about selling AI-powered experiences. Consumers want features that solve problems, save time, and delight. For device vendors, the ones who can sell the AI experience, translating AI into everyday user value, will be the ones that stand out.</p><p>For the consumer, the early adoption will be led by those who can quickly grasp the features, but the next wave of adoption will be increasingly from those who prefer or need new and simpler ways to interact. As AI becomes more accessible and integrated, expect it to play a growing role in purchase decisions. But for now, the path to adoption lies in showing, not telling.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With version 16.0 and newer, both in the stable and beta builds, Google has added new toggles that let you hide the period and comma keys from the main keyboard.</p><p>You can find these options in Settings under Preferences, where each punctuation key has its own switch, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/21/gboard-period-comma-keys/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. By default, both are on, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/top-gboard-tips-and-tricks">Gboard</a> looks the same as usual. If you turn one or both off, the bottom row only shows the spacebar, Enter, and ?123 keys. This gives you a wider spacebar and a simpler look.</p><p>This small change has been in the works for a while, previously spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gboard-hide-punctuation-keys-apk-teardown-3539471/" target="_blank">APK teardowns</a> that hinted at Google experimenting with punctuation visibility. Now, it’s officially rolling out, marking one of the more practical customization updates to Gboard in recent memory.</p><h2 id="great-for-minimalists-tricky-for-heavy-typers-2">Great for minimalists, tricky for heavy typers</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:223.38%;"><img id="vdeMVxW5fdAEhqvDh4X7md" name="Gboard-period-and-comma-key-toggles" alt="Gboard toggles for period and comma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vdeMVxW5fdAEhqvDh4X7md.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:97.89%;"><img id="558TvDbKeNQYb76KZW2Hod" name="Gboard-period-and-comma-key-toggles" alt="Gboard layout without the period and comma keys" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/558TvDbKeNQYb76KZW2Hod.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="1253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>This update is helpful for people who prefer a cleaner keyboard or often tap punctuation keys by mistake. Still, it may not work for everyone. If you use a lot of punctuation, you might find it a bit less convenient.</p><p>Without the dedicated period key, you’ll have to rely on shortcuts like double-tapping the spacebar to insert one, or jump into the symbol menu with ?123. Unfortunately, there’s no comparable shortcut for the comma, which might frustrate heavy texters who rely on it frequently.</p><p>This feature seems to be rolling out widely and is not limited to any region or language. When you turn it off, Gboard automatically changes the spacing and layout, so you keep the same usability but get a cleaner look.</p><p>Some users on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1oct4b6/gboard_now_lets_you_hide_the_period_and_comma_keys/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> like the simpler design, while others think the punctuation keys should stay visible, since not everyone wants to change settings for something so simple.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Only a few hours after the Galaxy XR headset launched, its optional controllers sold out in the U.S.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr-hands-on-impressions">Galaxy XR</a> made its debut in the US and South Korea with a hefty $1,800 price tag, marking Samsung’s return to the high-end headset game. The company also offered a pair of tracked controllers for an additional $250, or $175 during a brief launch discount. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/mobile-accessories/galaxy-xr/xr-controllers-silver-shadow-sku-et-oi610bjegus/" target="_blank">option to purchase</a> them vanished from Samsung’s U.S. website <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsungs-usd1-800-galaxy-xr-is-here-to-challenge-apple">shortly after the headset went live</a>.</p><p>While it’s still possible to grab a few units in South Korea, the U.S. stock seems to be wiped out completely, and Samsung hasn’t said when more will arrive.</p><p>The situation is more than just a case of high demand for accessories. The Galaxy XR is designed to operate on its own, using a mix of hand gestures, eye-tracking, and voice commands powered by Samsung and Google’s collaborative software.</p><p>That’s great for casual mixed-reality experiences, productivity tools, or spatial apps. But for anyone hoping to dive into more immersive VR titles or PC-VR content, the lack of controllers is a serious setback since many games simply won’t work without them.</p><h2 id="strong-demand-hints-at-a-bigger-vr-appetite-than-expected-2">Strong demand hints at a bigger VR appetite than expected</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2CeenrvW4GFy8T8Y8tncdn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly, Samsung has been clear that gaming isn’t the main focus of the Galaxy XR. Instead, it’s pitching the headset as a device built for productivity, creativity, and entertainment rather than the kind of intense VR gaming that Meta’s Quest lineup targets.</p><p>That might explain why the controllers are sold separately and weren’t bundled with the headset at launch. Still, given how quickly they sold out, it’s obvious that plenty of buyers are eager to use the Galaxy XR for more traditional VR experiences.</p><p>For now, Galaxy XR owners in the US are left with two options: wait for Samsung to restock the controllers or make do with the built-in controls until then. Either way, the rapid sell-out shows there’s strong interest in Samsung’s new mixed-reality platform, perhaps even more than the company anticipated.</p><p>If Samsung plans to expand the Galaxy XR’s availability beyond its initial two markets, it might want to ensure its accessory supply can keep up with the growing excitement.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In practice, this means conversations — including calls to landlines or older devices — will have background noise such as wind, traffic or construction filtered out, and voices on both ends will sound clearer. The feature is enabled by default, though users will have the option to disable it if they prefer.</p><p>Another major upgrade: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>’s web interface for calls and messages gains full support for RCS (Rich Communication Services). That means users can send high-resolution photos and videos and enjoy richer threads from a browser even if their phone is not within reach. The rollout for this is expected in early December.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe" name="Google-Fi-RCS-messaging-web-large" alt="Google Fi RCS messaging on the web" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jayPiHXcgWnt4HPkKCGQHe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To tackle weak indoor signals, Google Fi is expanding its Wi-Fi Auto Connect+ feature. For select devices (currently Pixel 5a and newer) the service will automatically connect to premium Wi-Fi networks at no extra cost and secure the connection via VPN. This expanded capability will cover tens of millions of locations including major airports (LAX, ORD, JFK) and participating retail malls and stores. On such networks you’ll see a “W+” icon in your status bar.</p><h2 id="bills-you-can-actually-understand-2">Bills you can actually understand</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk" name="Google-Fi-billing" alt="Google Fi billing summary" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fFbrXdc48XzCy6FUiQWPQk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In-app support is getting smarter too. The Google Fi app will now generate AI-powered summaries of your monthly bill: what you were charged, what changed since last month, and how any plan adjustments might affect your future costs. This aims to reduce the confusion around mobile bills and avoid needless calls to support.</p><p>To go along with the feature rollout, Google Fi is offering a limited-time promotion: new subscribers bringing their own phone and signing up for either the Unlimited Essentials or Unlimited Standard plans will receive 50% off for 15 months. The offer ends November 4, 2025.</p><p>If you’re already on Google Fi with a compatible device, the upgrades are mostly automatic and won’t cost extra. Google is weaving AI deeper into its mobile service as functional enhancements that address real frustrations: noisy calls, patchy indoor connectivity, browser-based messaging limitations, and opaque bills.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Ahead of its debut, reliable leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1980752134413914183">Arsène Lupin</a> has shared that the 16GB/512GB variant of the OnePlus 15 will retail for £949 (~$1,260) in the UK.</p><p>The leaker hasn't shared the pricing details for the base 256GB variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> yet, or pricing for other markets like the US and India, but the leaked price for the 512GB model could indicate that OnePlus plans to lower prices this year.</p><h2 id="oneplus-might-actually-lower-flagship-prices-this-year-2">OnePlus might actually lower flagship prices this year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h" name="oneplus-15-showcase-qualcomm-summit" alt="OnePlus executive holding OnePlus 15 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For context, the same 16GB/512GB version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> currently sells for £999 in the UK. That means if this leak is accurate, the OnePlus 15 could be £50 cheaper than its predecessor. It's unclear whether the base model's price will drop too, though the OnePlus 13's base variant launched at £899, so a small reduction could be on the table.</p><p>This potential price cut is refreshing, especially considering how other smartphone makers have gone in the opposite direction.

The brand has a new model in the range dubbed the TV Backlight 3 Pro, and the main highlight is that it gets HDR integration. That's interesting enough in its own right, so I installed the TV Backlight 3 Pro on my 75-inch TV, and used it for the better part of a month.</p><p>The TV Backlight 3 Pro is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJR9LKBQ">available on Amazon for $179</a>, and that's for the standard model designed to be used with 55 to 65-inch TVs. If you've got a larger TV, you'll need to get the 75 to 85-inch version, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Govee-Backlight-RGBWWIC-Supports-DreamView/dp/B0FJRJ8RG2/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3HNZLMGWJ3KWM&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.wMnCK5hien7WrDAf-VwFuV73Bpbe76dWYcKNDJ61lTyzQAmBhylYDMvt7u4jl63xUzMI9P4KZ7AM-IZuBFDf5mDI00wN73cDdKoqlDtuQBsLXn9Ng84cMft4sFSgaZ8Bf1Bk6dTvX5OEC9h2S119KnqNzGmnuTr0c5zo4UfkLOAFNQXYiV6BMMJ4H5UYZkv2NFOdydTpH30V-ZUtaHpdahpad-5TywHS_Lr2cUL2u9pz2g0Ablmacpvqzj2pD4spPg8F3NwE5ohUSMYa8V_72930CByqjPDlP4-x6YXa82w.Cwuu_cstzG-ll9ugZ0o0fx3Z5VrRnFgISOAqDnliyB4&dib_tag=se&keywords=TV%2BBacklight%2B3%2BPro&qid=1761128734&sprefix=%2Caps%2C436&sr=8-1&th=1">which costs $209</a>. The only difference between the two is that the 75 to 85-inch variant gets a 16.4ft LED lightstrip, with the regular model getting 11.8ft.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZYB43BULqWGhu8x52eYLcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like other Govee products, the TV Backlight 3 Pro is straightforward to set up, and installing it took just over 10 minutes. The camera positioning is better this time around, and it does a good job covering the entire length of the TV. On that note, the camera itself is new, and it has a trio of lenses that do are designed to deliver better color accuracy. Having tested it against the T2, that proved to be the case in my usage — the  TV Backlight 3 Pro got brighter, and it delivered better color rendition in HDR content.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vY4RFrWFjE5ZwQzyaELLkU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfMF6R7U7h3EpacHJidonU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EhSzEkmaKxcvE3mPtaobeU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU" name="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro" alt="Govee TV Backlight 3 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sLoL7oMaYjgjiMuHS7ZJcU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The lights are brighter as well, with Govee using its RGBWWIC tech.

The brand rolled out the Ranger earlier this year, and while the glasses are aimed at cycling, they hold up just as well during any outdoor activity. They're positioned as a 4-in-1 smart sunglasses, able to record footage, deliver built-in audio, serve as a walkie-talkie, and can be used with prescription lenses.</p><p>I've had the glasses for the better part of six months now, but I only started using them in earnest for two months during outdoor workouts, and they've been pretty great. They <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleequp.com/products/bleequp-ranger-ai-sports-camera-glasses-with-pro-grade-sports-goggles">retail for $379</a>, undercutting Meta's offering by a considerable amount. I used the glasses predominantly with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, and BleeqUp has an Android app that allows you to pair the glasses with just about any phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSxhdCmrhNuvCAnoScGuY3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5032" height="2834" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with the design; the Ranger weighs just 49g, and is just as light as regular sunglasses. It isn't that much chunkier either, and I like what BleeqUp did with the design. A big barrier to entry for smart wearables is the design, and at a quick glance, you can't even tell that the Ranger is any different to regular sunglasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xAzPnwTmfMh9WoecCAzjg3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The glasses are made out of plastic, and I didn't see any issues with the build quality or fit. I got the standard orange lens, but they can be customized with Zeiss lenses as well for an additional $20, and I suggest going this route. All lenses get UV400 protection, and I don't see any visible scratches after regular use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EJ6f6xR5A6NzXyGWsQVQh3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJ6f6xR5A6NzXyGWsQVQh3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Ranger has onboard controls that let you shoot images and videos, and you can easily adjust music playback.

The glasses get 32GB of onboard storage that lets you record up to five hours of footage, and they're powered by a custom Qualcomm Snapdragon W5 platform.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DUYz9eSvPtKdMHoriBgnh3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DUYz9eSvPtKdMHoriBgnh3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The glasses shoot 16MP stills and 1080p content at 30fps, and while image quality isn't anywhere as good as my DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro, they're not designed to go up against dedicated action cameras; the goal with these glasses is to deliver all-in-one sunglasses with the ability to shoot footage, and in that context, they're quite decent.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xmj94TYNJtRcHnU9o3rvj3" name="BleeqUp Ranger" alt="BleeqUp Ranger smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xmj94TYNJtRcHnU9o3rvj3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What I like is that they get EIS, and the app automatically creates highlights based on the footage shot.

I used several earbuds that have xMEMS drivers, and they do a good job delivering decent sound while taking up a fraction of the space as traditional audio drivers. The open-ear configuration combines good audio quality with the ability to filter ambient sounds.</p><p>Ultimately, the Ranger is a great choice for any outdoor activity, and the integrated design makes it a good choice if you need sunglasses with additional smarts.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="09f4d11f-36ef-48bc-80f6-5b20a820adad">            <a href="https://www.bleequp.com/products/bleequp-ranger-ai-sports-camera-glasses" data-model-name="BleeqUp Ranger " ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:83.09%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qt88swg2xfNaAofdX9ZRzP.jpg' alt="BleeqUp Ranger"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">BleeqUp Ranger </div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Ranger glasses look like regular sunglasses, but they come with plenty of smarts, and they do a great job outdoors. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

In a Reddit post, the company states that it's rolling out two versions of this patch for Pixels. Users with a Pixel 6, 6 Pro, or 6a will see vBP41.250916.010, while every other eligible Pixel sees vBP41.250916.010.<strong>A1</strong>.</p><p>While users who may have held off <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">can download Beta 3.1</a> (after enrolling), Google is offering a few solutions for those caught in the loop when QPR2 Beta 3 rolled out last week.</p><p>To begin, Google states users can wait and see if their device "recovers" back to Beta 2 after failing to boot properly. If that doesn't work, the company suggests USB debugging, if you've got that enabled (before the looping occurred). Another option involves downloading the Beta 3.1 OTA from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr2/download-ota">Android's Developer</a> site and placing your phone in Recovery mode to install the update.</p><p>Google has provided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available/">a step-by-step set of instructions</a> for five viable solutions to the bootlooping issue from QPR2 Beta 3.  It's worth noting that two solutions should be seen as a last resort, as they will wipe all of your device's data if used.</p><h2 id="major-problems-2">Major problems</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1obvh9e/android_16_qpr2_beta_31_now_available">Android 16 QPR2 Beta 3.1 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Last week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr2-beta-3-changes">brought Google's next wave</a> of Android 16 tests to enrolled testers, packed with a new button for app shortcuts. An added "+" icon brings more awareness to users that they can pin an app's shortcut. Other additions in the recent test brought Live Captions shortcuts for volume and even larger icons for the search bar.</p><p>QPR2 Beta 3 was quite a substantial patch, judging by its extensive changelog for Pixels, but it was quickly soured a day later by user reports.</p><p>That's when users started reporting the bootloop problems after trying to shift into Beta 3. It was reported that Google quickly removed the patch to avoid any more problems and to keep users who may not have known away from it.</p><p>So far, a few user reports on Reddit claim the patch has solved the issue.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is a clear way forward for the company to challenge Meta on a substantial level, offering users a way to get familiar functionality without the negative feelings some people harbor toward Meta as a company.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Based on this, we can expect Gentle Monster glasses to look like a normal pair of specs, complete with many different style , lens, and color options.

We should also expect these glasses to have cameras on them for recording life from a first-person perspective.</p><p>Samsung's partnership with Warby Parker sounds similar, with the company noting that it's "working with pioneering lifestyle brand Warby Parker, known for leveraging technology to create beautifully designed eyewear and deliver exceptional customer experiences."</p><p>To me, this sounds more like Samsung's direct answer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses</a> (that's the one with the display in the lens), similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">we already got to use at Google I/O this year</a>.

Announced today, the device marks the start of a long-term push from Samsung, Google, and Qualcomm to blend artificial intelligence with immersive computing, a move that could reshape how people work, play, and explore digital spaces.</p><p>At its core, the Galaxy XR is built on Android XR, a new platform co-developed by the three tech giants, with Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> AI baked right in. This means it’s not just a headset running Android apps but also an AI-powered device that understands your surroundings, responds naturally through voice, vision, and gesture, and helps you manage tasks in a more human-like way. Think of it as a spatial computing assistant that doesn’t just take commands but sees what you see and reacts accordingly.</p><p>Samsung calls the Galaxy XR the first step in its XR journey, with more form factors — including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">AI glasses</a> — already in the works. The headset’s design focuses on comfort for long sessions, using lightweight materials, a balanced frame, and a detachable light shield. The battery pack is separate, too, making the device lighter on the head while still lasting up to 2.5 hours on a charge.</p><p>Under the hood, it runs on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platform, with 16GB of memory and a Micro-OLED display pushing 29 million pixels at up to 90Hz. The visuals are said to be sharp, immersive, and backed by immersive sound from a dual-speaker setup. It also tracks your head, hands, and eyes with precision using a mix of cameras and sensors.</p><h2 id="your-favorite-android-apps-reimagined-in-3d-2">Your favorite Android apps, reimagined in 3D</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.79%;"><img id="siMn6Mk5PBkApawNiuoKVU" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siMn6Mk5PBkApawNiuoKVU.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3634" height="2427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR side profile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cxXQANwssegypWVFB9SYcS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR front view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uv5zjFjU6iH7kRCMd7VmjS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="KateGtDyuEZueAkRmseFyS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KateGtDyuEZueAkRmseFyS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="27LnPiqZtc3JCFQRd4RvzS" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR back view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27LnPiqZtc3JCFQRd4RvzS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 6 of 6</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="jNzoqLjqDXHFoam8mDQr5T" name="Galaxy-XR" alt="Galaxy XR top view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jNzoqLjqDXHFoam8mDQr5T.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Out of the box, Galaxy XR supports familiar Android experiences in 3D form — Google Maps, YouTube, Google Photos, and even Circle to Search — all optimized for the new environment. You can navigate cities in 3D, explore YouTube videos with real-time AI context, or simply draw a circle in midair to identify objects around you. Google Photos’ new Media Auto Spatialization further adds depth to your 2D pictures and videos.</p><p>The headset also doubles as a personal theater, letting you stream in 4K, catch multiple sports games at once, or play AI-enhanced XR games where Gemini offers coaching and gameplay tips. For creators, tools like Adobe’s Project Pulsar make 3D editing and cinematic layering easy and intuitive.</p><h2 id="from-play-to-productivity-xr-goes-enterprise-2">From play to productivity: XR goes enterprise</h2><p>Samsung isn’t stopping at consumer use either. The company is expanding Galaxy XR into enterprise, with partners like Samsung Heavy Industries using it for virtual shipbuilding training. It’s also working with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Spaces ecosystem to help developers bring XR business solutions to life.</p><p>And if the headset isn’t futuristic enough, Samsung’s also teasing upcoming AI glasses made with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster, blending smart tech with high-end fashion.</p><p>The Galaxy XR is available starting October 21, 2025, for $1,800, through samsung.com and Samsung Experience Stores. Optional accessories like the Galaxy XR Controller and Travel Case go for $250 each. Early buyers get The Explorer Pack, a bundle worth over $1,000, which includes year-long access to Google AI Pro, YouTube Premium, Google Play Pass, and a mix of premium XR content.</p> ]]></dc:content>

So when Samsung invited me to New York City to demo its Android XR headset, I was ready to dig deeper into Samsung's answer to Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest Pro.</p><p>I left my 30-minute demo disappointed, not by the headset, but because it only scratched the surface. I enjoyed a spatial 3D tour of NYC in Google Maps with Gemini as my guide and saw 2D YouTube videos converted into 3D using AI — just like I did during my last hands-on.</p><p>This demo reinforced the fact that Samsung has the hardware absolutely nailed: Galaxy XR is wonderfully comfortable, surprisingly light and well-balanced, and features the best resolution (3,552 x 3,840) that I've ever seen on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">VR headset</a>.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-pro-review">Meta Quest Pro</a> failed despite great hardware for the time, because no one wanted a $2,000 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-readying-799-quest-pro-three-other-vr-headsets-by-2024">"laptop for your face"</a> with only a handful of app partners and use cases. And Apple Vision Pro has its own app and gaming shortcomings, though it's sold much better.</p><p>So if you can feel immersed in a $300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a>, why spend $1,799 on Galaxy XR? The answer is apps: You need a mix of productivity, gaming, streaming, social, and browsing software, available to use <strong>simultaneously</strong>, to keep people in the headset <strong>all day</strong>, multiple days per week.</p><p>I wish I could have taken off the kiddie gloves and really put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> through its paces. However, my Galaxy XR demo — along with multiple demos on stage and in the press lounge that went more in-depth — proved that Samsung has pulled off something impressive and compelling, with Google's software as the ace in the hole.</p><p>The only question is whether Galaxy XR does enough to break through the current state of XR apathy.</p><div ><table><caption>Samsung Galaxy XR specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Specifications</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB RAM; 256GB storage</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>3,552 x 3,840, 29 million pixels Micro-OLED; 96% DCI-P3</p><p></p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh rate</p></td><td  ><p>60Hz, 72Hz (default), 90Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Field of view</p></td><td  ><p>109ºH; 100ºV</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera</p></td><td  ><p>6.5MP; 18mm/ F2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Two passthrough cameras; six world-facing tracking cameras; four eye-tracking cameras; five IMUs; one depth sensor; one flicker sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Mics & speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Six-mic array with beamforming; two dual speakers (Woofer + Tweeter)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio codecs</p></td><td  ><p>MP3, AMR-NB/WB, AAC/ AAC+/ eAAC+, Vorbis, FLAC, Opus, Dolby Digital (Plus, Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Video</p></td><td  ><p>Resolution: UDH 8K (7,680 x 4,320) @ 60FPS</p><p>Codecs: H.263, H.264, HEVC, MV-HEVC, MPEG-4, VC-1, VP8, VP9, AV1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>2 hours general use, 2.5 hours video watching</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7 (802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be); Bluetooth 5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>IPD</p></td><td  ><p>54–70mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>545g with forehead cushion (not including light shield)</p><p>Battery weighs 302g</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="gemini-is-the-key-to-the-galaxy-xr-experience-2">Gemini is the key to the Galaxy XR experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Y6KDb7EUQt2MPWWjXNBfTY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-press-demo" alt="Photo of Samsung's Jin Park and Max Spear standing on stage, Spear wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, with a Google Photos demo on a screen behind them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6KDb7EUQt2MPWWjXNBfTY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3985" height="2242" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Before my personal demo, Samsung engineer Jin Park and Google XR Product Lead Max Spear gave a live demo of the headset on stage, and the main throughline of every app showcase was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>.</p><p>Gemini speedily opened apps, shared good pizza places nearby in Maps, generated a Halloween-themed video with an accompanying nursery rhyme via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-3-veo-3-fast-fast-video-creation-vertex-ai-feature-teaser-announced">Veo 3</a>, interpreted and explained the context for YouTube videos about golf and English architecture, and gave gaming walkthrough tips for Stardew Valley as Spear played.</p><p>Most ambitious was a game called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt37600020/">Asteroid</a>, directed by Bourne director Doug Liman, in which Gemini creates scripts and personalized responses for NPCs, voiced by actors and celebrities like Doug Perlman, Hailee Steinfeld, and D.K. Metcalf. Park spoke to "Metcalf," and when she switched to Korean, so did Gemini, translating Metcalf's dialogue while still using his voice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-pinch-controls" alt="A photo of the author wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset, holding up one hand in a pinch gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aJmgPPA92R2VBSsuJ8tjAN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Testing Google Maps in Galaxy XR </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The demo available to journalists was much less ambitious in scope, but I did get the chance to dive into a truly immersive version of Google Maps and have Gemini act as a tour guide. Last time, I explored Yosemite and learned the history of El Capitan; this time, I looked around New York City to find places to visit.</p><p>Something new to the experience was that Google has begun to create "full digital reconstructions of indoor spaces using just 2D imagery and AI."</p><p>Basically, so long as Google has enough user-provided photos of a restaurant, museum, or attraction, you can warp inside it and then drag yourself around the space using gesture controls, seeing what a place looks like "in person" before you visit it yourself. Spear said they have "over 1,000 of these available in New York City alone."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-gesture-controls" alt="A photo of the author doing a two-handed pinch-to-zoom gesture while wearing the Samsung Galaxy XR headset." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QEU5Xs8NSYTNdwSfZsnMsB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pinching-and-zooming is seamless </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also dove into YouTube on Galaxy XR. Like last time, they showcased 180-degree and 360-degree videos that take full advantage of VR, as well as stereoscopic content with a 3D effect.</p><p>What most intrigued me was how Google used AI to automatically add spatial layers to 2D videos, subtly transforming old 2D content instead of depending on a limited 3D library.</p><p>Google also added a spatial multiview mode to YouTube for watching multiple live sports games simultaneously. I can't see this coming up very often, but it goes to show how multitasking is a key draw to Galaxy XR.</p><p>Otherwise, Samsung is promising that Galaxy XR will be the "only" XR device with Netflix, with a traditional VR theater view and resizable windows. We'll have to wait and see what other streaming apps appear; in theory, any Play Store app should be available.</p><h2 id="a-mix-of-casual-and-enterprise-use-cases-2">A mix of casual and enterprise use cases</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-controllers-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset's controllers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M8E9jXaETRhiuqkWo7J8fM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Quest 3</a> owner, I've wondered how Galaxy XR would handle gaming.

It was a nice surprise to see Galaxy XR's independently tracked controllers — even if they cost $249 extra.</p><p>Any Play Store games should be playable in a windowed format on Galaxy XR.

But Samsung has an advantage: "All apps built on the Android platform work right out of the box on Galaxy XR." Only a few apps will be "Made for XR," but early adopters won't be waiting impatiently for the promise of new content.

And since you can use a controller or mouse/ keyboard in addition to pinch gestures, it's an upgrade on taps and swipes.</p><p>The real question is whether people can afford to buy this in addition to a laptop, since wearing <em>anything</em> for eight hours a day can be onerous, let alone a one-pound headset. But if you'd normally consider buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/should-you-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-or-s11-ultra">Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra</a> for $1,300, the jump to $1,799 may not be that insurmountable to your budget.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-XR-from-behind-lenses" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy XR headset sitting on a pedestal, focused on the lenses and padding." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LizsCrDiGus5EiZbLvJdM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't predict how well Galaxy XR will sell, despite its tremendous potential. Samsung made sure to mention in its keynote and press release that it'll make AI smart glasses soon, using Warby Parker and Gentle Monster designs. It felt like a reminder that glasses have become more popular, while headsets have fallen out of vogue.</p><p>Having already tested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google's AR glasses prototype</a>, I do think Android XR will work well for Samsung's smart glasses.

Galaxy XR has the display and power necessary for a much wider range of use cases.</p><p>While my Galaxy XR hands-on was disappointingly short, the live demos worked near-flawlessly on stage, and they convinced me that "Project Moohan" is an impressive device for anyone who can afford it.

The publication states that the One UI 8 update for the Galaxy S23 series has seemingly disappeared from Samsung's servers. While the post speculates this One UI 8 suspension may not last long, nothing's clear. Samsung's software is no longer accessible by users' devices; however, it hasn't explained why.</p><p>The publication highlights that Galaxy S23 users who've gotten the update (it's been out for a few weeks now) haven't reported major issues.</p><p>Curiously, X user Akhilesh Kumar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Koram_Akhilesh/status/1980536427017564172">reported on the same situation</a>, stating the patch was pulled from servers concerning European and Indian users. The safest bet right now is that Samsung's discovered an issue with its software and pulled it before it affected too many people.</p><p>A few users on X replied to the post, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/samsung_now389/status/1980570228921942173">wondering if others</a> were having battery drain problems. Some with a Galaxy S23 state their battery is performing more or less the same as it has been. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BoogieD262/status/1980558886668284052">was one user who reported</a> that their Galaxy S23 FE <em>is </em>struggling with battery life and that they can't use their phone for "more than three hours."</p><p>Perhaps this is the issue Samsung has identified, but it's probably best not to wonder and face reality: One UI 8 is suspended for the S23 series.</p><h2 id="what-s-really-going-on-2">What's really going on?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-display-home-screen-01.jpg" alt="The home screen of the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTCatu8L3QoUmhnWWfkSDf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>What's (not-so) funny is that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-early-one-ui-8-on-galaxy-s23-android-16-expands">started rolling out its One UI 8 update</a> to the Galaxy S23 series on September 29. The patch was ahead of schedule, as we weren't expecting the Android 16-based OS to arrive until October. Galaxy S23 users were given a huge 3GB download, packed with the latest goodies, security features, and more. The rollout appeared fine, as, again, reports were riddled with problems.</p><p>However, that's no longer the case, as Samsung yanked it, which it's already done with the Galaxy S22 series. This strangely happened a week after the S22 series started downloading the new patch, indicating Samsung spotted something amiss quite quickly.</p><p>Nearly a week ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-halts-one-ui-8-update-for-galaxy-s24-in-south-korea">Samsung suspended</a> its One UI 8 update on the Galaxy S24 series. The suspension was spotted for consumers with the models in South Korea first, as its OTA file vanished. Reports added that the S24 FE was roped into the pause, as well. Much like the S23, Samsung has refrained from stating why it's stopped the rollout, despite previously rolling through its scheduled plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The main highlight states users can soon expect Live Updates to bring "key travel journeys that include flights, train trips, and events."</p><p>Google also details that it's bringing an update that moves Gmail closer to Wallet for passes.

These alerts were constant updates that users could lean on about their train rides, knowing whether or not it's delayed, on time, or otherwise.

They're not designed to stay secure and withstand sweat or water like a dedicated pair of fitness earbuds. Fitness buffs will turn to alternatives instead, which are expensive.</p><p>Our favorite fitness earbuds are the in-ear Powerbeats Pro 2 at $250 and the open-air <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review">Shokz OpenFit 2</a> at $180. While both are great, their price tags might be tough to justify for people who already own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. The question is: do you need to spend that much to get a pair of Android earbuds that'll handle the gym, the track, and everything in between?</p><p>To find out, I tested Belkin's new SoundForm ActiveFit earbuds — an intriguing pair of fitness buds priced at just $42. That's a fraction of the cost of a Powerbeats Pro 2 set. Even as a Powerbeats enjoyer, I wasn't convinced my preferred running earbuds were more than five times better than the SoundForm ActiveFit.</p><p>After using the SoundForm ActiveFit and the Powerbeats Pro 2 side by side, Belkin's offering blew me away. There are clear shortcomings, as you'd expect, but the value proposition for the SoundForm ActiveFit is readily apparent.</p><h2 id="how-the-belkin-soundform-activefit-cover-the-basics-2">How the Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit cover the basics</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-1" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6wA5V34hpfUXuHDCs4k699.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Normally, I'd be hard-pressed to recommend buying a pair of earbuds this cheap. You get what you pay for where audio is concerned, although the gap between budget and premium earbuds seems to be closing more by the day. It's a completely different story for workout earbuds — sound quality is lower on the list of key features.</p><p>While crisp vocals and booming bass are always appreciated, they're not necessities for fitness earbuds. Instead, traits such as water and sweat resistance, battery life, comfort and fit, and awareness loom large. The last point is crucial. Awareness is needed for safety while running, walking, or biking in public areas, and that's why people often turn to earbuds with ANC and transparency mode.</p><p>Letting the right sounds in ensures a runner or biker is tuned into their surroundings. The problem? ANC and transparency are quite hard to find on budget earbuds. That's why I was surprised to see "Hear-Thru Mode" on the SoundForm ActiveFit, which uses the onboard microphones to enable passthrough sound.</p><p>It's essential for outdoor workouts, even if it's not <em>true</em> ANC or transparency mode in the conventional sense.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-4" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HDbEvDPLthvHPSCP6fsbA9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The next thing I look for in workout earbuds is a comfortable and secure fit. Belkin checks this box with a silicone ear hook that wraps around your ear for maximum security. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> have this too, but don't feel as stable in the ear — likely because they're a bit smaller and have a different insertion angle.</p><p>Durability and sweat-resistance are covered by an IP54 rating, matching the Beats' IPX4 liquid certification but adding dust resistance. You get nine hours of playback from the earbuds, plus another 27 hours from the charging case. The case itself has USB-C and a built-in lanyard loop, perfect for living in your gym bag.</p><h2 id="how-the-powerbeats-pro-2-justify-their-lofty-price-tag-2">How the Powerbeats Pro 2 justify their lofty price tag</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pAYWgdLWKCLEY7qQDUqNC9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The SoundForm ActiveFit are actually solid in terms of volume, even if the earbuds tend to get tinny at higher volumes. The default EQ profile is Belkin Signature Sound, and you can switch to Bass Boost and Balanced if you please.</p><p>I wouldn't recommend it, however, as the sound signature simply sounds off in the other modes. One boosts the bass at the expense of everything else, and the other cuts it out almost entirely.</p><p>This is where the Powerbeats Pro 2 comparatively shine. They're better-sounding with a balanced profile that borrows sound signature and hardware from the famed AirPods Pro 2. Additionally, their on-earbuds controls are better, with Beats providing physical buttons on each bud plus a volume rocker.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eqDLaej3kzKTt9GnXtuPmC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 also add active noise-canceling, transparency mode, and an Adaptive EQ setting. Battery life is slightly longer, at 10 hours from the earbuds on a single charge. They generally have more microphones and sensors, but the SoundForm ActiveFit do support a newer version of Bluetooth.</p><p>The elephant in the room here is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro">the Powerbeats Pro 2's support for heart-rate monitoring</a> via an in-built optical sensor. There is also an accelerometer and gyroscope for good measure; the Powerbeats Pro 2 put the <em>fitness</em> in fitness earbuds.</p><p>The thing is, all these upgrade areas fall firmly in the "nice-to-have" category rather than the "essential" category.</p><h2 id="do-you-need-to-spend-a-fortune-on-workout-earbuds-2">Do you need to spend a fortune on workout earbuds?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iBuCRfM3SRHy2cc7cwBta9" name="Belkin-vs-Powerbeats-5" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 compared with the black Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iBuCRfM3SRHy2cc7cwBta9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As such, I'm confident saying you probably would do just fine with the $42 earbuds instead of the $250 ones. I've run countless miles with some generation of Powerbeats in my ears, and could definitely make the switch to the Belkin SoundForm ActiveFit and not miss a beat.</p><p>They cover all the basics, and the $42 price point is a feature in itself. If one earbud falls down the storm drain or gets crushed by a dumbbell, you probably won't lose any sleep over it.

That's a lot of capital letters in one name but you might start typing in all caps when you see this incredible <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-NXTPAPER-T-Mobile-Smartphone-Paper-Like/dp/B0F62N5KXF"><strong>$199 deal</strong></a> for the phone right now on Amazon.</p><p>That's a solid 20% off the price and you don't even need to wait until Black Friday to get it!

Plus, that backlight is 100% flicker-free, ensuring that even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM-sensitive</a> people can use the phone without headaches.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="173af2c0-968c-447f-8b19-573ac05e0f9b" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This budget-priced phone feels ever-so-premium thanks to the impressive TCL NXTPAPER technology powering its eye-friendly display.

You can configure this to automatically switch to one of the three alternate display options — color paper, ink paper, and max ink — or just choose via pop-up box that appears when you slide the key upward.</p><p>That makes it handy for switching between screen modes when you're just in the mood to read. Ink paper mode is best for reading books, while color paper mode is best for things like manga or comics. Max ink mode is for those times you want to unplug and get a bit of digital detox in for a while, as it turns on extra battery saver and shuts down most apps.</p><p>The camera is also quite good for the price range, offering punchy shots with good color and nice dynamic range. Plus, the phone ships with Andorid 15 under the hood.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-06" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER apps in Max Ink Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As Derrek noted in our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-review">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER 5G review</a>, this phone isn't a powerhouse and won't be impressing anyone with its performance. You shouldn't ever expect a $199 phone to be as fast as a $1,000 phone, but it's still worth noting before jumping in.</p><p>And as much as I love NXTPAPER technology, the screen is a little difficult to see outside during those extra bright days. It's something you can get used to and may be a worthy trade-off if you prefer reading indoors but, again, well worth noting if you're a person who spends a lot of time looking at their phone outside.</p><p>Even with those downsides, it's hard to say no to this phone for just $199. That's a heck of a deal that won't be any lower for a long time to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And I already know I'll wear these more than my Ray-Bans.</p><p><em>You</em> may not need the Vanguard's IP67 water resistance for sweaty workouts, 6db-louder speakers to counterbalance wind, or an extra hour of battery life for longer activities. They're not the right fit for using indoors, with no Transitions or clear lenses; nor is the Oakley Spheara style suited to "blending in" like Ray-Ban Wayfarers.</p><p>I don't depend on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a> for every occasion, as Meta would like; it's only during workouts or hikes, when my phone is an unwelcome distraction, that Meta's AI answers, hands-free videos, and workout playlists really compel me.</p><p>While I was impressed during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 testing</a>, they're still better suited for casual wear. With the Oakley Meta Vanguard, it's clear that these are the better fit for runners, hikers, cyclists, or extreme sports fans — despite some caveats I'll explain below.</p><h2 id="i-actually-prefer-the-oakley-meta-vanguard-design-2">I actually prefer the Oakley Meta Vanguard design</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-on-face-2" alt="A photo of the author wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard with a valley behind him." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pWmRnXwmQEPgmoMmL6cKue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Smart glasses are noticeably thicker than normal glasses to fit the cameras, speakers, and battery, as well as bear the weight. The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)s aren't <em>bad</em> in this respect, but every non-techie I've had try them on says they like the features but not the chunky look on their face.</p><p>Most Oakley sunglasses, on the other hand, are massive and flashy, with a thick nose guard and top bar; this gives the Meta Vanguards leeway to be big without seeming out of place. They're twice as heavy as the Spheara design that inspired them, but I feel sporty wearing them, instead of dorky.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-back-view" alt="A photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard glasses from the back, with the arms extended toward the camera and the back of the lenses in the center." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zEJEHutjQ3aGozL6HgTu7f.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-front-view" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard of the front lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdA58mWTKBReXECXmjiene.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-right-side-view-Oakley-logo" alt="A top-side view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses on a wooden table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ixsgvYPqXWKCbZ2Wyyzsue.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-nose-pads" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's nose pad and Meta logo between the lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELHWRLvaZTmnMo8wgUGuhe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-left-arm" alt="A close-up of the Oakley Meta Vanguard's left arm showing the Oakley name and manufacturing info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fVfvisCeyN4kRuusiU3hBf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You'll have to accept that these glasses weigh a lot, putting pressure on your nose. But unlike with Ray-Bans that need to be fitted tightly to your face to avoid sliding, the Vanguard's built-in nose pads prevent sliding, even with sweat and the up-down motion of running.</p><p>Still, it's a pressure point where 66g of weight presses down, especially for any downhill running or hiking. It won't affect you much after a single workout, and cyclists should be okay unless they're bouncing up and down mountain paths for hours. But after a long hike on Saturday and a two-hour run on Sunday, my nose feels sore and needs a break.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-top-down-view" alt="A top view of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses showing the top bar and arms." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nwCgVtd6FxJPX5McnNoKze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Some people won't mind the extra weight for the best smart glasses experience, while others will find them cumbersome.

cool if Meta gave the Vanguard <strong>landscape</strong> photos and videos. I know that portrait mode is what's in vogue for Meta's apps or TikTok, but the GoPro athletic crowd wants as wide and immersive a view as possible. Even if portrait is the default, Meta should allow us to switch perspectives with a voice command or button tap.</p><p>I also recorded videos using 1080p at 30/60FPS and 3K at 30FPS at various points during a 13-mile run. I can't embed them here, but I can assure you that it's difficult to tell them apart! The 3K view is slightly more immersive, but more prone to jittering from fast movement; I preferred the 60FPS mode, which looks wondefully smooth and creates the feeling of gliding down my running path.</p><p>My only real problem was that the Oakleys' revamped speakers are so loud and rich that your music is audible in videos; I've learned to pause my music before recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH" name="oakley-meta-vanguard-official-lifestyle-01" alt="An official lifestyle image of a person wearing Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BWfZmteW2MPX4ssMAMAdH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Vanguard's slow-motion videos are best suited to extreme sports </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vanguard has four different stabilization settings — Auto, Low, Medium, and High — based on how much you want to balance out or preserve rapid movement. I didn't get to play with these settings too much, but it's great to see Meta putting this power in the hands of users, and the High setting is, again, buttery smooth.</p><p>Of the Vanguard's two new video modes (slow-mo and hyperlapse), I absolutely loved creating hyperlapse videos of my hike, fast-forwarding through my slow climb down a steep hill and then winding down the trail path.

It's partially due to mistrust of Meta, and partially because they can just glance down at their wrist for the data.</p><p>I plan to write a more in-depth test of Garmin and Strava integration on these glasses, but for now, I've been impressed by how speedily Meta AI can pull your live information like current/ average pace, elevation gain, cadence, running power, HR zone, and other stats within a second of asking.</p><p>Meta AI can't recognize every stat that Garmin tracks, but I still appreciate getting the highlights without have to search through data fields on the go.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-with-Meta-AI-workout-summary" alt="Photo of the Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses sitting on a treadmill next to a phone showing a Meta AI workout summary." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JNzPdRyHKoSGPTgzcbKFeD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's not especially fun to pant out "Hey Meta" before every request, but at least the "Respond without 'Hey Meta'" setting lets you ask follow-ups easily.

That's about on pace with what I've experienced, but I don't <em>only</em> stream music; I'm also taking frequent photos or videos, which burn through battery much more quickly.</p><p>Here's a better barometer for battery life: During a 2-hour run, Garmin Autocapture took 24 five-second videos, while I recorded another seven 30-second videos for my video stabilization testing; I also listened constantly to music and asked Meta AI for Garmin stats about 20 times. I ended at 49% battery, putting me on pace for 4 hours with <strong>heavy</strong> usage.</p><p>If I chilled out with the commands and videos, I think Oakley Meta Vanguard could last long enough to accompany a marathon run, or a 100km ride for a competent cyclist.</p><p>Even if the battery capacity fades with time, Oakley Meta Vanguards have a really solid baseline, and I appreciate that we get IP67 dust and water resistance to withstand sweaty workouts or accidental drops on dusty trails.

However, this South Korean report suggests that Samsung's advancements may have pushed the Exynos 2600 over the speed of Apple's and Qualcomm's latest chips. The report compares the chip to the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, purporting that Samsung's is roughly 29% better in graphical performance and 30% better in NPU.</p><p>When it comes to Apple's A19 Pro, rumors state the Exynos 2600 is ~75% graphically and potentially ~14% better in multi-core (CPU) performance.</p><p>These rumors reiterate what we've heard before, that the Exynos 2600 is built on Samsung's 2nm process. AI is another major part of the chip that's reportedly going to shine through on the Galaxy S26 series. The publication claims that Samsung "focused heavily on AI performance," seeking to surpass that of Apple's devices.</p><p>Such a report makes it seem like Samsung is going to utilize its chip in as many places as possible, but that might not be the case.

It’s built around an AI server-grade liquid that stays stable from -60°C to 108°C, paired with a 24,000rpm fan, a ceramic micro-pump, and a four-layer heat dissipation setup. Oh, and the liquid actually moves visibly inside a translucent ring on the back.</p><p>Under the hood, the RedMagic 11 Pro packs Qualcomm’s new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, backed by up to 24GB of LPDDR5T RAM and UFS 4.1 Pro storage. RedMagic also threw in its own RedCore R4 chip to handle touch and graphics optimization, and even a PC emulator in the China version.</p><h2 id="the-trade-off-a-smaller-global-battery-2">The trade-off: A smaller global battery?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGo9MTjPB4ZuTwds2Hp6ET.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS" name="RedMagic-11-Pro" alt="back side of the RedMagic 11 Pro in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yG5evH9rXMXiF58P3e8bsS.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Battery life is another flex point — an 8,000mAh cell that supports 120W wired and 80W wireless charging. RedMagic says it can last over 13 hours in MOBA games. The tradeoff for the upcoming global release, though, is that international models might get a smaller battery to comply with regional safety standards, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Global-release-confirmed-RedMagic-11-Pro-to-launch-internationally-but-with-major-battery-caveat.1140945.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>.</p><p>Up front, you get a 6.8-inch BOE X10 AMOLED display with 2,688 × 1,216 resolution, 144Hz refresh rate, and an under-display camera. The display also supports eye protection tech for marathon gaming sessions.</p><p>Cameras are surprisingly capable for a gaming phone — dual 50MP shooters and advanced streaming support up to 8K60Hz.</p><p>The RedMagic 11 Pro starts at 4,999 RMB (around $680) in China and comes in black, silver, and transparent editions. The global launch is set for November 3, where we’ll see if RedMagic brings all its cooling tricks overseas or keeps some of the magic exclusive to China.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update specifically concerns Meta's AI characters and the personal chats users can have with them, one-on-one. For Teen Accounts, Meta states parents will have three new capabilities accessible, beginning with the ability to disable AI character chats completely.</p><p>Instead of having these characters for questions and answers, Meta states that any Teen Account with that disabled will still have access to its AI assistant. Through the assistant, the AI will tune its answers to be educational and age-appropriate for teenagers.</p><p>Meta is also planning to bring the option for parents to block specific AI characters that their teenager has access to. This would serve as an alternative to disabling the feature completely. Lastly, Meta plans to give parents better insight into the conversations their teens are having with AI characters and the company's AI assistant.</p><p>The post adds that these three planned upgrades come off the back of "concerns" parents have expressed about their children interacting with AI chatbots.</p><h2 id="protections-for-younger-users-2">Protections for younger users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:689px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh" name="meta-instagram-parental-settings-approval-request.jpg" alt="Supervised teen accounts on Instagram must request approval when changing settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/57QUKoZCVFVmggYWxUAPHh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="689" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The company states that it seeks to have guardrails in place so parents can be further informed and can have the right discussions with their teens, if need be.</p><p>These AI/parental tools will start on Instagram in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia (English users) "early next year."</p><p>Teen Accounts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-is-rolling-out-a-restricted-version-of-its-app-for-teens">rolled out around this time last year</a>, as a restricted version of Instagram where parents can monitor and control what their child sees. Teens under 16 years of age qualify for a Teen Account, and these profiles are defaulted to "private," forcing users to approve users who attempt to follow them. Sensitive content in the Explore tab and Reels is much harder to come by, as well.</p><p>Meta rolled these out, as previously stated, in the U.S., the U.K., and Australia before other countries last year. It hit Europe two months later, before arriving globally the following year. There's a chance we'll see a similar rollout to this updated vision Meta has for parents and their kids.</p><p>Just last month, Instagram's AI gained the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/instagrams-ai-now-detects-and-protects-teens-even-if-their-profile-says-theyre-adults">ability to detect teen accounts</a> even if they've lied about their age. If the AI determines a user is underage, it will automatically switch their account to a Teen Account. This update also brought notifications to parents in Canada.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, most phones I used in 2025 did a great job delivering on both fronts; devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> have incredible cameras that run tings around what Google and Samsung have to offer, and they last longer.</p><p>Interestingly, this year's launches have been characterized by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">mainstream use of silicon battery tech.</a> This has allowed Chinese phone manufacturers to predominantly use bigger batteries without any material difference in size or weight. The result is that most phones I used in 2025 came with 6,000mAh batteries, lasting a day and a half without breaking a sweat.</p><p>In fact, battery anxiety is a thing of the past, and outside of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/iphone-air-is-the-coolest-phone-i-used-in-2025">iPhone Air</a>, there isn't a single phone where the battery didn't comfortably last a day. What's notable is that Chinese phone brands are now starting to add even bigger batteries in their phones, leading to devices with 7,000mAh or larger batteries.</p><p>The result is that we are finally at a point where phones can reliably last two days between charges. Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/i-used-the-vivo-x300-and-x300-pro">X300 Pro</a> has a 6,510mAh battery, and the Xiaomi 17 Pro Max and Find X9 Pro have even bigger 7,500mAh batteries. In fact, most Chinese brands are going this route with their latest phones, and while I was initially worried that the thin phone trend would catch on, I'm glad to see that hasn't been the case.</p><p>Clearly, this is made possible by adding a mix of a silicon-carbon in the anode, and while 2025 phones only had a 10% silicon content in the batteries, brands are increasingly using higher ratios of silicon, and that's how we are getting bigger batteries in phones that aren't any heavier or bulkier than their predecessors.</p><p>One downside to this is that not all global models are getting the same battery size. While Vivo sells the X300 Pro with a 6,510mAh battery in Asian markets, the Austrian unit has a significantly smaller 5,440mAh unit, which is just annoying. I'm using the Austrian unit of the X300 Pro, and while I still get a day's use easily, it doesn't last as long as the X200 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro hands-on testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vVbC7kmCbLvCGg3a2o55HR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the Find X9 Pro, Xiaomi 17 Pro Max, and iQOO 15 should have the same battery size in all countries, giving these devices a distinct edge over their rivals. Another factor to consider is the charging tech; while Chinese brands dabbled with 120W and 150W standards, the industry has settled around 90W and 100W charging, and this is again down to the use of silicon batteries.</p><p>From conversations with device makers, it's evident that 90W is seen as the sweet spot these days; it is fast enough that even a 7,000mAh battery is able to charge in an hour, and it doesn't lead to any unnecessary battery degradation. What I like even better is that most Chinese phones now offer USB PD integration at least up to 50W, and this makes charging these battery behemoths easier.</p><p>Like last year, the battery advancements are limited to Chinese manufacturers, with Apple, Google, and Samsung largely unbothered by silicon battery tech. While Google went with a slightly bigger battery on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, it's clear that these brands have no intention of using silicon-based anodes on their devices anytime soon, handing over all the momentum to their Chinese rivals.</p><p>As much as I'd like to see a Pixel or Galaxy phone that lasts two days between charges, it's evident that we are still a few years away from that. Thankfully, that isn't the case with the latest Chinese phones, and with these devices set to debut globally in the coming weeks, you don't have to wait too long if you're looking to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p>Sales, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/amazon-prime-day">Amazon's Prime Day</a> events or any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday deals days</a>, are a great time to buy a new phone. They are also a time when regular pricing trends go out the window.</p><p>Normally, last year's model gets a healthy price cut when the new one launches, and buying one is a good way to get a great phone while saving a nice chink of money. Big sales can change this, though.</p><p>We saw it during the last one with the Google Pixel. Normally, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is a good bit cheaper now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro</a> is here.

However, there are some good reasons to buy a relatively new model versus a brand new one, though.</p><p><strong>You will save some money</strong>. Once stock of a new model arrives, retailers want to move out all the existing stock, meaning they need to catch your eye, and the very best way to do that is to cut the price.</p><p><strong>It's still new</strong>. When you buy a 2024 phone in 2025, it's probably still going to be brand new. That means you'll get the full warranty, and the battery won't have a year's worth of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">wear and tear</a>. If it lasts 3 years when you bought it in 2024, it will last three years when you buy it in 2025.</p><p><strong>No big improvements</strong>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore's law</a> isn't dead, but it's on life support. Before we'll gigantic shift with much faster or more efficient hardware, science has to figure out where to put it and how to do it. It will, but for now, the newer stuff is only incrementally better than the older stuff.</p><p><strong>You don't care about the new features</strong>. You know that a newer model Pixel is going to come with special <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI </a>tricks that older Pixels don't have. Some will never come to last year's model. If you don't care about them, don't pay extra for them.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-when-to-buy-a-new-model"><span>When to buy a new model</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-back-01" alt="The back of the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xtXzTUsdKZZMv5UwYHdTkT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Unless there is a serious manufacturing flaw, you can't go wrong buying the newest model. You'll pay for the privilege, though. Here's when you should buy the newest, and why.</p><p><strong>The price</strong>. Normally, you'll pay more, but big sales events can change that. Decide on a number you're okay with; let's say $150. When the new model is less than $150 more than the older one, go for it.</p><p><strong>Support lifetime</strong>. Every good company now offers multiple years of software support and updates for a new phone. A phone built in 2024 that comes with five years of support reaches end-of-life in 2029. One from 2025 lasts until 2030. If you plan on keeping it around for a while, this matters.</p><p><strong>Manufacturer incentives</strong>. Often, a new model will come with things like a better trade-in policy, a discount on headphones, or even a great deal on other brand-new products like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch</a>. Consider what else you'll be buying, what you have to trade in, and what the total price will be once it's all tallied up.</p><p><strong>New features</strong>. Those Gemini AI tricks I mentioned above? You might really want one or more of them. If the only way you'll ever get them is to buy a new phone, well, you're going to have to do it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-you-re-winning-either-way"><span>You're winning either way</span></h3><p>There is no right or wrong answer for this one, because each of us wants something different. All I can do is tell you what I think and why, using that same Pixel as my example</p><p><strong>Today</strong>, I would buy a Pixel 9 Pro over a Pixel 10 Pro. There are no real differences that matter to me, and I like saving money. That all changes if they are only $100 apart. I'd take the 10 Pro in a minute. Maybe something new will come along that requires the small hardware bump, and I'll have it, and I'll probably be able to find a coupon that saves me money on a charger or something.</p><p>I buy a phone for myself every two years, and I usually buy a model from the year before. This time, I didn't <em><strong>because</strong></em> of a big sale: I got my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">2024 Moto Razr </a>for a few dollars more than the 2023 would have cost me.</p><p>Shopping wisely and doing a bit of research saved me money. It can save you money, too.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="9939d19b-5e07-40ea-8e71-baeba2ee80e1">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDvuEpuneFYQKQMvgu3z7C.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A well-rounded flagship</strong></em></p><p>Google's Pixel 10 Pro takes the same design from the Pixel 9 Pro and overhauls the internals.

Among its advancements, the OnePlus 15 has been confirmed to feature a massive 7,300mAh Glacier Battery. The Chinese OEM has paired this new battery with its focus on improving the phone's gaming capabilities. OnePlus states this battery is designed to enhance its "ultra-high-frame-rate gaming" experience.</p><p>Of course, with such an expanded capacity, users can game for longer, whether they're playing Zenless Zone Zero or trying to catch Pokémon in Pokémon GO!</p><p>Joining this 7,300mAh battery is a 120W "Super Flash Charger" and a 50W "Wireless Flash Charger." The Chinese post states that this is the "year's only" (machine-translated), potentially indicating the OnePlus 15 might be the only phone consumers see this level of charging on.</p><p>The company, once again, confirms that the phone will launch on October 27.</p><h2 id="confirmed-and-coming-up-fast-2">Confirmed, and coming up fast</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xXM7o6wRjzCuSPHipnjhnc" name="OnePlus-15-revealed" alt="OnePlus 15 shows off at Qualcomm Snapdragon Summit 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xXM7o6wRjzCuSPHipnjhnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus originally revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier Battery technology</a> last year, as it prepared to bring it to its devices. At the time, the company announced a 6,100mAh capacity for its phones that year, but we're now seeing that leap by over 1,000mAh with the OnePlus 15.

It's been confirmed that the phone will bring a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 and a 165Hz refresh rate display, which leans into that major gaming focus. It'll also enhance your scrolling and video-watching experience, too.</p><p>Another confirmed aspect is that the OnePlus 15 will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15s-color-lineup-may-omit-a-long-standing-favorite-as-it-gains-a-165hz-refresh-rate">feature three colors</a>: Sand Storm, Absolute Black, and Mist Purple. It's expected that global markets could see the OnePlus 15 by mid-November, so there's a chance interested consumers in the U.S. won't have to wait <em>that </em>long.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company's cloud platform that a major chunk of the internet including apps like Reddit, Fortnite, Snapchat, Canva, Apple TV, and more rely on saw disruptions to it servics. Some reports even claim that<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ccn.com/education/crypto/aws-outage-coinbase-robinhood-venmo-list-of-affected-platforms/"> government services</a> around the world and many companys were impacted by this outage.</p><p>According to several sources, people started seeing issues with the services in the wee hours of the morning around 12am ET, while it the outage seems to have hit its peak at 3 am ET. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://downdetector.com/status/aws-amazon-web-services/">Downdetector</a>, between 4am ET to 12pm ET, over 13,000 people in have been impacted by this outage. Reuters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/amazons-cloud-unit-reports-outage-several-websites-down-2025-10-20/">says</a> that it was the largest internet disruption since last year's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huge-microsoft-windows-outage-disrupts-services-globally"> CrowdStrike outage</a> that brought, banks and airports, to a halt.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perplexity is down right now.
