                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>Google Maps is testing emoji reactions for images in business listings.</li><li>Available emojis include heart, pray, fire, tongue-out, and a mind-blown option.</li><li>Tapping an emoji triggers a small animation, but reactions don't yet appear on images.</li></ul><p>Google Maps seems to be testing a new feature that lets users react to images in a listing, similar to how you can currently react to messages in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>.</p><p>Currently in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, when you open a listing you see the listing's name, options like call and directions at the top, followed by images. You can swipe through the carousel of images and video or look for more in the Reviews section, but there's no way to react or leave feedback to an image. Google now seems to be testing that.</p><p>On my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro</a>, opening a listing shows a new "Press and hold to react" overlay on images with reactions above them. Pressing and holding an image shows five reactions above it, which include heart, pray, fire, a side tongue emoji (probably to react to an image of a restaurant), and a mind-blown emoji.</p><h2 id="photo-reactions-are-coming-to-google-maps-2">Photo reactions are coming to Google Maps</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JYfNUU5ompnZdkHTe8XEHA" name="google-maps-reactions-test" alt="New tap-to-hold emoji reactions in Google Maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JYfNUU5ompnZdkHTe8XEHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tapping an emoji triggers an animation. For example, hitting the heart icon shows a big-sized heart that swirls across the screen. Moreover, when you first leave a reaction to an image, a dialog box informs the user that these emojis will be shared with Google and shown publicly.</p><p>However, on my device, tapping an emoji does nothing to the image, and there's no way to tell if you've reacted (unless you tap-and-hold it again), as nothing shows up in the UI.</p><p>In Google Messages, if you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-double-tap-to-react">react to a message</a>, the emoji shows up below it, but emojis don't appear in Google Maps for now. It's also worth noting that these are the only five emojis available, and there's no way currently to add others.</p><p>There's no official word on what the feature is meant to achieve, but Google likely sees reactions as a quick way to boost engagement on Maps listings. The feature would make it easier for users to quickly share feedback on photos without leaving full reviews.</p><p>The feature doesn't appear to be rolling out widely just yet, as I could spot it working only on my Google Pixel 9 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, and not on any other Android devices or iPhone. However, since the feature has been spotted, it looks like it could roll out anytime soon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Available in black and gray, they’ll hit Samsung’s site, carrier stores, and major retailers on September 4.</p><p>Samsung is pitching these earbuds as an upgrade over the previous Buds FE, with a bigger speaker for richer sound and beefier bass. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) comes standard, helping drown out background noise on commutes or crowded spaces.</p><p>For calls, Samsung repositioned the microphones and added an AI-powered noise filter that’s trained to separate your voice from whatever chaos is around you.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.39%;"><img id="TU5gdWGeCD5YAm86sgYH3N" name="Galaxy-Buds-3-FE-black-without-case" alt="black Galaxy Buds 3 FE buds side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TU5gdWGeCD5YAm86sgYH3N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="740" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="smarter-controls-and-galaxy-ai-2">Smarter controls and Galaxy AI</h2><p>Controls are straightforward too, allowing you to pinch the stem to play/pause or swipe for volume.

You can track them with Find My Earbuds, tweak settings through the Galaxy Wearable app, and manage basic functions right from your phone’s quick panel.</p><p>While the Galaxy Buds 3 FE start at $150, Samsung is offering a limited-time $30 trade-in credit if you send in an old pair of wired or wireless headphones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now that I'm signed up for the Garmin Tucson marathon in November, just three months out, I have to decide quickly which plan to try. Should I trust a smartwatch algorithm to give me a personalized marathon training plan, or use a running coach plan from TrainingPeaks?</p><p>It's been a few years since I last ran a marathon. When Garmin offered a media invite to run in its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-marathon-series/">Garmin Marathon series</a>, I knew I'd have to ramp up my mileage quickly, but intelligently, so I don't overtrain and crash out.</p><p>I've reviewed pretty much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">every running watch</a> under the sun, but whether I use my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Garmin Forerunner 970</a> or another device, my success or failure will depend on the workout plan, more than the hardware.</p><p>So I decided to sit down and compare every smartwatch marathon training plan, to see which would best prepare me for the Garmin marathon series.</p><h2 id="every-smartwatch-based-marathon-training-plan-for-beginners-2">Every smartwatch-based marathon training plan for beginners</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL" name="Garmin-intermediate-marathon-training-plan" alt="The Garmin Connect intermediate marathon training plan, highlighting a specific week of training runs: Intervals, recovery, cross-training, intervals, and long run." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8XDsqC2GvZtQN7VdEPPKwL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1906" height="1072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Very few smartwatches recommend long-term training plans.

It recommends weekly intervals and has more back-to-back run days, plus longer long runs, but still mixes in rest and cross-training days.</p><p>Garmin's training load philosophy emphasizes low aerobic and anaerobic variety to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">improve VO2 Max</a>, plus strength training to optimize your form. I'm normally all about this philosophy, but frankly, if I'm going to increase my workout days per week and hit my marathon target, I need to spend most of my time focused on mileage. <em>Next</em> marathon, I'll worry about speed and power.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2224px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zb8PBjsVNSeHVandHQna8M" name="Coros-marathon-training-plan" alt="A COROS training hub web page showing a 12-week marathon training calendar, with a month of training runs visible, each with a description of the type and intensity." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zb8PBjsVNSeHVandHQna8M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2224" height="1251" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: COROS)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>COROS: </strong>COROS has 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://coros.com/training">marathon training plans</a>, targeting specific finish times or 12-to-20-week schedules.

You can't simply choose a marathon training plan; if Samsung ranks you lower, you'll have to spend weeks, if not months, leveling up. But if Samsung eventually lets runners pick their target distance and pace manually, however, the Running Coach has a great variety of run types like Fartlek, repetitions, intervals, and long runs that would benefit beginner marathoners.</p><p><strong>AMAZFIT:</strong> Zepp Coach has you choose a target marathon pace and date, then describe your weekly mileage and average pace. With that, it generates a three-month program of easy, hard, interval, fartlek, and long runs, grouped by HR zones or pace depending on your preference.</p><p>It's not the most comprehensive or varied training plan, but it's available for super-cheap watches like the Amazfit Bip 6 or Active 2, which is great for frugal runners.</p><h2 id="which-marathon-training-plan-i-m-going-with-2">Which marathon training plan I'm going with</h2><p>All of these marathon training plans are "free" after you buy your watch, so we can't complain too much if they're a bit limited. You can find <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.trainingpeaks.com/training-plans/running/marathon">thousands of TrainingPeaks marathon plans</a> if you want to pay for something better.</p><p>Personally, after all that searching, I'm leaning toward a straightforward <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/">Hal Higdon novice training plan</a>, which are popular with first-time marathoners. Rather than focus on complicated speedwork or strengthwork, I'll just check off four runs a week of about 20–30 miles and hope for the best.</p><p>I'm a few weeks behind his 18-week schedule, but I'm hoping I can hit the ground running, so to speak, because I've already been training. Then, once I've conquered this Garmin marathon, I can go into another marathon with a more advanced plan.</p><p>But if you have a favorite marathon training plan that helped you hit a PR, I'd love to hear your recommendations in the comments!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Last year, the company introduced its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">NXTPAPER Key</a> to complement its unique displays, and now, we finally get to experience it in the United States with the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER.</p><p>While not a flagship by any means, the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER does stand out from the pack, thanks to the more eye-friendly display that can effectively transform the phone into an e-reader with the flip of a switch. I like to think of it as having a Boox Palma living inside your smartphone, which should appeal to anyone who likes to read but doesn’t want to carry a separate e-reader with them at all times.</p><p>TCL’s current offering isn’t for everyone, but the technology involved is one I would like to see more of.</p><h2 id="tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-specs-2">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER specs</h2><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>TCL UI v8 (Android 15)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.78-inches, IPS LCD, FHD+ (1080 X 2460), 120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chip</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6100 Plus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide/macro</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>5MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>2MP depth</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>32MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Fingerprint (side), facial recognition</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,010mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>18W wired</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>167.6 x 75.5 x 8.22mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>199.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Space Blue</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="nxtpaper-display-pros-and-cons-2">NXTPAPER display pros and cons</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UquLiKUu8koiF74UhEiBw9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-02" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER transitioning between normal and Ink mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UquLiKUu8koiF74UhEiBw9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Transitioning between normal and Ink Paper mode. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When you hold the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER, you’ll immediately notice why it’s different. The NXTPAPER display is unique in both look and feeling thanks to its very matte display. It feels incredibly soft to the touch, and your hand just glides across the screen with ease. I first thought the phone had a screen protector on it, which is just how unreal the experience is. It's supposed to feel more paper-like, in contrast to the glossy displays found on nearly all other smartphones, and the change comes with some nice benefits.</p><p>Gone are the fingerprints you would find on a traditional smartphone display. TCL’s multi-layer display also filters out 61% more blue light than other devices, so it’s safer on your eyes. While I’m not clear on how this display measures up for those with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>, it should still make the viewing experience more comfortable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VnNVKErKAJoMKRdzquprz9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-9" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER eye care settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnNVKErKAJoMKRdzquprz9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Colors are still pretty vibrant when in normal viewing mode, even if the FHD+ LCD panel won’t quite match up to the contrast of an OLED. TCL also has a host of display features aimed at improving visuals and eye comfort. When indoors, I’m pretty pleased with the display overall.</p><p>It’s outdoors where things fall apart a bit. The NXTPAPER display is actually quite challenging to see in direct sunlight, which is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/exploring-tcl-nxtpaper-display-tech">unfortunate downside of the technology</a>.</p><p>You may also want to be wary of scratches. I’m not quite sure what caused the scratch on my review unit, but it appears much more pronounced than what I've seen on other phones in my years of reviewing devices.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3415px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8r7jcofndgprsikdDtXgH9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-14" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER display off with a scratch in the top corner" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8r7jcofndgprsikdDtXgH9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3415" height="1921" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch">NXTPAPER Key</a> is the real star of the show, though, letting you easily switch to one of three other display modes: Ink Paper, Color Paper, and Max Ink.</p><p>The first transforms the phone into a typical black and white ink display, similar to what you’ll see on a Kindle or other e-readers. Color Paper Mode is more or less the same, but adds a dash of warm, muted color to everything, almost as if you’re looking at a '90s TV screen. With these modes, you’re still able to use your phone just like usual.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="27rahYm6TA2HqjmtdToziA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-15" alt="The NXTPAPER Key on the TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/27rahYm6TA2HqjmtdToziA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3916" height="2203" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DECywEhWFWXV7CwTfACWCA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-01" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER display modes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DECywEhWFWXV7CwTfACWCA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9B9aWn8qArho26UBL7rTc9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-08" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER in Ink Paper Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9B9aWn8qArho26UBL7rTc9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4047" height="2276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MJ2V8bEHYwbSSjhcgNBRKA" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-07" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER in Color Paper Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MJ2V8bEHYwbSSjhcgNBRKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3963px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9" name="TCL-60-XE-NXTPAPER-review-06" alt="TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER apps in Max Ink Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9zwTMDJGG9gFHLAFoq3eP9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3963" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Max Ink Mode emulates the e-reader experience as much as possible for users who want to take a break from the world and just focus on reading. It limits app use aside from a select few that you can choose, disables the app drawer and notifications from apps not allowed in Max Ink mode, and only provides access to a handful of settings.

The keynote is expected to begin at 10 am PT/ 1 pm ET. The event will be livestreamed on Google’s official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Google/videos">YouTube channel</a>, as they do every year.</p><p>For a comprehensive overview of everything we know so far, be sure to check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><u><strong>Pixel 10 Ultimate Guide</strong></u></a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/06b4UeDcQbE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><strong>TLDR: This year’s event is expected to unveil four Pixel 10 phones with the Tensor G5 chip, two sizes of the Pixel Watch 4 running Wear OS 6, and rumored accessories including Pixel Buds 2a and “Pixel Snap.”</strong></p><p>This year's event is anticipated to feature four devices: the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. The phones are expected to get the next-gen Tensor G5 chipset. Additionally, we expect the Pixel Watch 4 in two sizes, powered by Wear OS 6 and its latest UI enhancements. On the accessories front, several rumors indicate a potential launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">Pixel Buds 2a</a>, along with Pixel-specific accessories allegedly called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories"><u>"Pixel Snap."</u></a></p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 series will include four models—Pixel 10 (Frankel), Pro (Blazer), Pro XL (Mustang), and Pro Fold (Rango)—with the base Pixel 10 gaining a triple camera setup, larger battery, 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display, 12GB RAM, and up to 256GB storage.</strong></p><p>Looks like the Pixel 10 series is shaping up to have four different models this year, keeping up with Google's usual release style. This is backed by some leaked codenames of the devices, likely to show up as:</p><p><em>Pixel 10, codename Frankel</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro, codename Blazer</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro XL, codename Mustang</em></p><p><em>Pixel 10 Pro Fold, codename Rango</em></p><p>Google might not radically change the overall design for its upcoming flagship; however, it is giving the base model a much-needed boost. The Pixel 10 will finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">feature a triple rear camera array</a>, which could include a 50MP main, a 12MP ultrawide, and a 10.8MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom. Other alleged specs include a larger battery, a 6.3-inch 120Hz OLED display with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">improved brightness and PWM dimming,</a> 12GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:832px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.77%;"><img id="6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26" name="google-play-store-pixel-10-promo-leaked" alt="A leaked image of the entire Pixel 10 series (in moonstone and indigo), as leaked via a Play Store discovery." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6MekhJAJ4Pc5Wngw5b7d26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="832" height="464" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>TLDR: The base Pixel 10 is rumored to come in four new colors: Obsidian (black), Frost (light blue/purple), Indigo (bright blue), and Limoncello (yellow-green).</strong></p><p>When it comes to the base<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats"> Pixel 10’s colors</a>, Google seems to be mixing things up on that front as well. A recent leak showcasing renders of the Pixel 10 hinted at four fresh color options: Obsidian, Frost, Indigo, and Limoncello.</p><p>Obsidian is the usual black, Limoncello is the yellow-green combo we've seen in earlier leaks; Indigo looks a lot like the Bay blue but brighter, and Frost lands somewhere between light blue and a soft purple tint.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb" name="google-pixel-10-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YwMYQmfEbzn2BzsJ5gRfcb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL will likely come in Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade, while the Pro Fold may come in Moonstone or Jade, with certain colors tied to specific storage options.</strong></p><p>While we’re on the topic of hues, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats"><u>rumor hinted at the fact</u></a> that Google could be tying certain colors to the device’s storage options. Strange, yet a smart move by Google! What better way to entice a user to grab a higher storage option? We’ve already told you the base variant’s colorways.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro and the Pro XL are getting their color lineup: Obsidian, Porcelain, Moonstone, and Jade. As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, you’ll only get two picks: Moonstone or Jade.</p><p>So, to break things down, if you’re eyeing the Pixel 10 Pro in Jade finish, you might have to reach for the 256GB model. The same goes for the Pro XL. And if you're leaning toward the foldable Pro in Jade, you might not get the 1TB. The Pixel 10 Pro XL in Porcelain and Moonstone might not even see the 1TB option. On the other hand, the Obsidian version could still come in 128GB, thankfully.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Model</p></th><th  ><p>Color</p></th><th  ><p>Storage Configurations</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Frost</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Indigo</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Lemongrass</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></td><td  ><p>Obsidian</p></td><td  ><p>128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Porcelain</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>Jade</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL are expected to keep similar displays with Gorilla Glass Victus 2 protection, run on the Tensor G5 chip with 16GB RAM, and feature larger batteries—4,870mAh and 5,200mAh respectively.</strong></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-xl-large-and-in-charge-major-leak-weeks-before-launch">Pixel 10 Pro and the bigger Pro XL </a>might see key variations when compared to their predecessors.

In his recent X thread, Blass posted a series of images that look like marketing images stolen right out of Google’s handbook. In the post titled "PD" (Pixel Drop), we get a good look at the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> in some of its rumored colorways. Blass also shared images of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> in a grey colorway (supposedly called Moonstone).

And the rumored large 5,200 mAh battery could last on a single charge for  ~24 hours or more. Additionally, the RAM size for the device could be capped at 16GB.</p><p>The tipster also alleges the 10 Pro XL will feature 8K video recording capabilities and a 42MP selfie camera. The triple array on the back is rumored to consist of a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with 100x zoom. Blass also doubled down on the fact that not much will change with the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to have a 6.4-inch cover display, an 8-inch main OLED screen with 120Hz and 3,000-nit brightness, and a refined hinge for sleeker bezels and better ergonomics.</strong></p><p>Moving things along, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to feature a 6.4-inch 120Hz cover display and an 8-inch OLED main display, with about 3,000 nits of peak brightness. Google is reportedly working on tweaking the hinge on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. This should make the bezel around the cover screen much sleeker giving users more screen space(6.4 inches vs. 6.3), and also make it sleeker to hold on to.</p><p>Google doesn’t seem to be getting into the “we make the slimmest foldable” race yet, as alleged images of the foldable online don’t show any drastic reduction in the width of the phone.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold may become the first foldable with IP68 water and dust resistance, a 5,000mAh battery, and support for 23W wired and 15W wireless Qi2 charging.</strong></p><p>While the tech giant isn’t making the slimmest foldable out there, rumors indicate that it could be making the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect"><u>foldable to get the IP68 water and dust resistance rating,</u></a> which could be a game-changer, as the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be “dust-tight” meaning no dust can penetrate and potentially damage internal components, and could be protected against submersion in water beyond 1 meter.

However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. As for its camera array, the fold is rumored to sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable; however, these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a> The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is rumored to show up in Moonstone and Jade colorways.</p><p><strong>TLDR: A leaked promo video and Google’s own early tease revealed the Pixel 10 Pro Fold’s hinge, Moonstone colorway, and a camera design similar to its predecessor.</strong></p><p>Another X to post showcased the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1953493258358661438/video/1"><u>alleged promo video</u></a> of the Pixel 10 Fold, showing us a close-up of its hinge as well as how the device would look when unfolded, in its Moonstone (grey) colorway.

While Chinese manufacturers have switched to massive 1-inch modules to differentiate their phones, Google could once again leverage its machine learning smarts to maintain its advantage.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel 10 Pro Fold needs major camera upgrades to stay competitive with rival foldables like the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Vivo X Fold 5.</strong></p><p>Where Google needs to roll out considerable upgrades is the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. While the Pixel 9 Pro Fold continues to be a great foldable, it just doesn’t have the cameras to measure up against its rivals. Google nailed the sizing of the device, and the software is a delight to use, but the cameras are underwhelming to say the least, and this is something that needs addressing this year.<br><br>With the Vivo X Fold 5, Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the Honor Magic V5 showcasing what’s possible with foldable cameras, Google needs to show that it can also deliver standout cameras on its upcoming phone.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel Watch 4, launching at Google’s Aug. 20 event, is expected to be slightly thicker than its predecessor but feature smaller bezels and marginally larger displays.</strong></p><p>Apart from Google’s flagship Pixel 10 series, the next generation of the Pixel Watch will also launch at this year’s Made by Google event set to take place on Aug. 20 in New York. And rumor has it that the Pixel Watch 4 could see some significant upgrades compared to its predecessor. <br><br>In April, we were privy to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">alleged renders of the Pixel Watch 4</a>, showcasing what the smartwatch would look like. And right off the bat, the one thing that was seemingly noticeable is that the new Pixel Watch 4 could be 2mm thicker than the Pixel Watch 3. Without any drastic changes, it could retain its same round-dome display, but it appears to have even smaller bezels than the Watch 3. While the Watch 3 had 1.27- and 1.43-inch displays, we may be closer to the same 1.3- and 1.5-inch screen on the new watch.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel Watch 4 could debut with a new AI-driven Snapdragon Wear chipset that promises more power, better efficiency, and potentially up to a week of battery life.</strong></p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 could finally be getting a bump in the chip that runs it. The Pixel Watch 2 and 3 use the 4nm Snapdragon W5 Gen 1 chipset with Arm cores, which also powers the OnePlus Watch 3. However, this time around, Qualcomm hinted at a new and improved chipset that could power the Pixel Watch 4.<br><br>When AC’s Senior Editor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="mailto:michael.hicks@futurenet.com"><u>Michael Hicks</u></a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025"><u>spoke to the Qualcomm VP of wearables</u></a>, Dino Bekis, about the Qualcomm-Google partnership, he discussed the "feature-focused" and "AI-driven" Snapdragon Wear chipset coming in 2025, coinciding with the Pixel Watch 4 launch. According to Bekis, this chip would deliver "more compute capability" and "headroom" for a significant boost over the current Gen 1. Additionally, he added that they were also focused on giving the chip "a week's worth of battery life" for Wear OS, which means you don’t have to reach for your charger as often.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel Watch 4 will launch with Wear OS 6, offering a refreshed UI, dynamic watch faces, and extensive personalization options.</strong></p><p>While leaks only give us what <em>might </em>show up on the wearable, there’s one thing we can definitely say will make it to the Pixel Watch 4. It will come fully equipped with the stable Wear OS 6. This means the watch will feature the latest Material 3 Expressive UI, bringing more fluid scrolling, buttons, and notification cards that shrink closer to the display edge while still displaying information, and buttons that expand when tapped. With the new OS, users will be able to get dynamic watch faces and themes, along with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/wear-os-6-will-bring-facer-back-onto-android-watches">third-party watch faces</a>.</p><p>Which means users can heavily personalize and style the Pixel Watch 4 in their unique way.</p><p><strong>TLDR: The Pixel Watch 4 will leverage Google’s Gemini AI to provide personalized assistance, including habit-based advice and text suggestions that mimic your unique writing style.</strong></p><p>Speaking of personalization, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-leak-gemini-ready-personal-assistance-suggestions?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhfacebook&utm_content=null&fbclid=IwY2xjawMMWiZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETF3UFJkdW10YmtEdkl4NVFMAR7Z8sGVGtjQUyvRWJE8JdyuguUZdjQhf9NNvnPy-zlvgnuSwsJ9T8muxftokw_aem_NNGUu3aTsnbCYS1cCs-_zQ"><u>word on the street</u></a> is the Pixel Watch 4 will use Google's Gemini, which should bring some new tricks to the wearable. A recent leak suggested that the Pixel Watch 4 will come with a "quick AI assistant" for whatever you need.</p><p>Plus, the leaked images and text showed that Gemini will offer "personalized help." This points to a really advanced understanding of your habits, preferences, and what you're doing, so the watch can give you advice and suggestions tailored just for you. One of the most exciting bits of this personalization is the "text suggestions" that "sound like you." This means Gemini will actually learn your unique writing style, making it more authentic, rather than making you sound like a robot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The narrator talks about the joy of opening a new phone and then "opening your new phone" because it's a foldable... get it?</p><p>But what we didn't expect to see was Google opening up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold in the first tease itself, basically revealing both panels of the device. The teaser shows off the device's hinge and a clear glimpse of its camera housing on its rear panel. The final glimpse involves the 10 Pro Fold's inner display, which the teaser gives a complete look at.</p><p>And just in two days, Google drops another video, showcasing the Fold again, but this time, hinting at a possible change in branding. As the video ends with the title "Google Pixel Fold," which is the name of the very first model. Now we don't know for certain if this was a slip-up by the company that wasn't spotted during final reviews, or if Google seems to be working on a much easier title for its device. Only time will tell.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="perplexity-and-others-eye-google-chrome-2">Perplexity and others eye Google Chrome</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZogmMvXgwJrn6aMHtVxdd5" name="google-chromebook-2024-fall-event-2.jpg" alt="Google Chrome logo at 2024 Fall Chromebook Event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZogmMvXgwJrn6aMHtVxdd5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/perplexity-just-made-a-usd34-5-billion-offer-for-chrome"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-usd35-billion-bid-for-chrome-tops-perplexity"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, could be forced to sell Chrome as a remedy to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">antitrust ruling</a>.

Phones are one of those things that start to lose value the minute you buy them, but that doesn't mean they don't work as well as a brand-new one will. Everyone likes to save a little money.</p><p>There is one other good reason to look at a certified device - someone who knows how it should work has looked at it in person. We all know sometimes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">phone launches can be a little problematic</a>, and small bugs end up in users' hands. Those bugs usually get fixed right away if they can be.</p><p>Whether a phone was returned because of those bugs or not, whatever "fix" was done should be applied as part of the renewal. Some things, like small scratches, are acceptable, but when things don't work as they should, the phone won't be resold until they do.</p><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-where-can-i-recycle-my-phone">saving an electronic device from the landfill</a> and giving it a new life is good for our planet. That's enough reason to search out "used" phones!</p><p>None of this guarantees the value is there, though. And for this deal, it's <em>totally </em>not something you should buy.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-official-camera-preview.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle images of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, buying a renewed device can be a great idea. Foldables are no different, and there are a few extra reasons why.</p><p><strong>You're probably going to get a new screen protector</strong>. You might think that's not a big deal, but I'm talking about the factory-installed polymer screen protector that should never be removed. Polymer is a fancy word for plastic, and it's soft. It gets microscratches and fingernail dents on it a lot easier than glass would. You can't change it yourself, but Samsung can.</p><p><strong>The display should be inspected and have a full warranty</strong>. Any tiny scratch on a foldable screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">can be a death sentence</a>, and even with that screen protector, it happens.</p><p><strong>The hinge will have been inspected</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-most-important-feature-of-a-folding-phone-is-durability">hinge is the most important component</a> on a phone that folds, and it has to be perfect; at least be 100% within the design specs. Someone will have looked at this one and made sure.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd" name="mrmobile-galaxy-fold-damage-3.jpg" alt="A damaged Galaxy Z Fold screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>There are two reasons why I wouldn't recommend this deal to anyone.</p><p><strong>The price is crazy high</strong>. Samsung's asking $1,169 for a used and refreshed phone that's two generations old. Simply put, that's about $400 more than you should <em>ever</em> spend on a Galaxy Z Fold 5 in 2025.

The judge has yet to make a final ruling, but indications are that this isn't the way it will go. We'll have to wait until all the dust settles for the whole answer.</p><p>There are good reasons why we shouldn't want to see Chrome just sold off to the highest bidder. First, who has the capability to maintain it the way it needs and isn't just as bad at Google when it comes to alleged market share abuse? (Hint: nobody.)</p><p>I still believe that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-will-die-if-split-from-google">without Google, Chrome and Android will die</a>. The only reason to invest the time and money into keeping a project like Chrome alive is to make even more money.</p><p>We're talking a massive investment. There are thousands of people actively working on "Chrome" in some capacity. Those paychecks — as well as research and development costs, testing, and numerous smaller ancillary expenses — all add up to the millions. You and I can't afford to buy Chrome, but even if we could, we would never be able to afford keeping it alive.</p><h2 id="everyone-wants-a-slice-of-this-pie-2">Everyone wants a slice of this pie</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1384px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb" name="mobile browsers-2.jpg" alt="Mobile web browser apps on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8Ac4X4cRe3hvcrhdfULb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1384" height="779" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've heard about potential buyers from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/perplexity-just-made-a-usd34-5-billion-offer-for-chrome">Perplexity</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/yahoo-buying-chrome-isnt-as-crazy-as-it-sounds">Yahoo</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/new-usd35-billion-bid-for-chrome-tops-perplexity">Search.com</a>. But really, every tech company would love to be the one that controls Chrome, because it holds about 60% of the web browser market. That means six of every 10 people use the Chrome browser.</p><p>Technically, there are several companies that would be great stewards of Chrome. Oracle, Nvidia, ARM, etc., all would be able to devote the resources needed to keep things moving forward.</p><p>Unfortunately, none of these companies or those that have expressed interest should ever be in charge. Neither should Google, for the very same reasons.</p><h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh" name="Google-Search-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Google Search on HP Chromebase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQT3SZsmGNc2Vnnuj4gizh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The internet is a mess of websites about anything you can imagine, from online shopping, business listings, social media, and things that aren't safe to talk about. One thing that keeps it usable is Search. Indexing everything the internet has to offer and delivering it in an easy-to-digest way is something everyone depends on.</p><p>That's where a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a> becomes a powerful and profitable tool. You can open your browser and go to www.google.com or www.bing.com and search for something, and it works just fine. Or you can type whatever you're looking for into the address bar of your web browser and get the same results.</p><p><em><strong>Maybe</strong></em> the same results. Your web browser uses a default search engine like Google when you use it this way. Do you see the issue here?</p><p>If I control what search engine users get by default (like Google does with Chrome or Microsoft does with Edge), I now have an advantage. If I'm also a search company (again, like Google), it's a huge and <em>probably</em> unfair advantage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TNn4y4ENeSptPSRPTi9pvi" name="Google-Search-widget-on-homescreen.jpg" alt="Google Search widget on homescreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TNn4y4ENeSptPSRPTi9pvi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Roydon Cerejo / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It wouldn't be if there were no manipulation of the results. Ideally, you should be able to do a search on any engine and get the same results in the same order, no matter what engine you use. They all crawl and index the same pages and gather the same information, so the results are what they are unless you get creative.</p><p>Search websites are very creative. Ads, shopping links, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-testing-generative-ai-weather-summaries-for-search">AI summaries</a>, and keyword weighting make all the difference and are why the same search on Google and Bing gives different results in a different layout.</p><p>Of course, the search company gets paid for these types of links. A lot. Their customers expect a good return on the investment, so all kinds of analytics are collected and used to make sure you see the right ads and shopping links in the right places at the right time.</p><p>You know what? That's fine. It drives innovation, which means a better experience for everyone, and the company that does it the best deserves its place in the market.</p><p>The world doesn't work that way, though. A company with the means to manipulate 60% of web search traffic is going to leverage that into money. If you control the browser and the search engine, you're ****ing in high cotton. You can point users towards anything you want. You can't make them click, but you can make sure they can if they want to.</p><h2 id="just-leave-it-to-google-2">Just leave it to Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1669px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj" name="openai-searchgpt-hero-wide.jpg" alt="OpenAI debuts "SearchGPT" prototype." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1669" height="939" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No company that has any stake in a search engine has any business controlling Chrome. I've said it out loud. Not because I don't want Google or OpenAI to make money, but because there will be abuse of that market share. It's human nature.</p><p>The same goes for any company with the financial means to make "special" deals with a search engine. When Amazon pays for 100 ads to be shown, it should be treated the same as Bob's Pet Store when it pays for 100 ads. Bob doesn't have the same means as Amazon, so you're probably going to see links to buy your fish food from the retail giant and not Bob.</p><p>Just because the problem is obvious doesn't mean the solution is. Every company has an agenda, and the potential to abuse a product with that much leverage. They can tell you they're the good guys, but they'll still try sneaky ways to make a dollar. It's their duty to do it because shareholders demand it.</p><p>Whoever <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">buys Chrome</a> (if Google is even forced to sell it off) won't build some sort of quasi-socialist "for the people" web browser with it. It will be business as usual. I don't have a clue how this should be handled, but I know for certain that most of the company's interested in it have no business with control of Chrome.</p><p>We might as well leave it in Google's hands if we're going to give it to any of the companies that can afford it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's been a blast being able to use all of these different foldable phones, but I've recently found myself missing the 9 Pro Fold and growing impatient for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>There are a lot of factors at play when it comes to picking what phone my SIM card goes into, but towards the tail end of my time with the Fold 7, I started missing the Pixel. Don't get me wrong, the Fold 7 is everything that I was hoping the Fold 6 would have been, besides the S Pen being put to rest.</p><p>The best way I can describe is to say that the Z Fold 7 is the "work" phone, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the "home" phone. However, the Fold 7 or Find N5 are the phones that I gravitate towards when it comes to tinkering with Switch emulation or trying to see what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/color-me-shocked-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-an-absolute-beast-for-gaming">Windows games I can get running in Winlator</a>.</p><p>If the leaks and rumors are true, I'm really hoping that will no longer be the case.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-doesn-t-need-a-flashy-design-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't need a flashy design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MW96tBzamrvYps6QWYpmd6" name="Google-Pixel-Pro-Fold-10-teaser" alt="Screen of a Google foldable phone being unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MW96tBzamrvYps6QWYpmd6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1156" height="650" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the outside, the leaks point to Google playing it "safe" with the design this year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-doesnt-need-a-galaxy-z-fold-7-moment-and-heres-why">that's probably not a bad move</a>, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. I'm sure Google will throw some new and flashy colors at us, with the vibrant ones being relegated to the regular Pixel 10 phones and showing signs of running out of ink on the Pro models.</p><p>But that's not where the excitement comes in for me, although I do love it when Google makes a green or orange phone. Instead, my excitement lies with the expected introduction of the Tensor G5 with the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="google-s-taking-the-leap-2">Google's taking the leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Until now, Google's Tensor chip has been manufactured by Samsung, and while it's been a good run, it hasn't been great. The problem has been that the Tensor processor lags at least a generation or two behind what Qualcomm and MediaTek release. And for the most part, it's been fine, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the best iteration yet, but between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> improvements and general Android upgrades, Google needs to turn things up a notch.</p><p>Google reportedly did just that for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> by making the switch from Samsung to TSMC. According to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">leaked benchmarks</a>, the Tensor G5, which appears to be built on a 3nm process (the Tensor G4 was a 4nm chip), could be more than 30% faster than its predecessor. Those are the kinds of improvements we were hoping to see last year, but it just wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Admittedly, this doesn't mean that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be able to go toe-to-toe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, or even the regular 8 Elite for that matter. But it doesn't need to, at least not yet, because it's also rumored that the G5 is Google's first "fully in-house made processor."</p><p>That's an important point because it's also what Apple and Samsung do with their respective processors, and it just so happens that Google is now relying on the same company that Apple does to produce its processors.</p><h2 id="what-s-it-all-mean-2">What's it all mean?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ" name="terminal-app-pixel-9-pro-fold-android-16-beta-3-1" alt="Terminal app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold running Android 16 Beta 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why does it matter, and what does it mean? Well, nothing really, at least if you're upgrading from the Pixel 9. But as we saw with the addition of the Linux terminal with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 Feature Drop</a>, Google has <em>something</em> planned for the future, and it's probably going to be big. So, having complete control over the design and manufacturing should give Google all of the tools it needs to truly blend the hardware and the software.</p><p>And that's without even talking about what Google might have in store for the future of Gemini. I wouldn't be surprised if we were also introduced to a new Gemini model, with "nano-banana" and references to "GEM_PIX" making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter). So when you consider what Google was able to do with the Tensor G4 for Gemini, having more control from top to bottom, along with better general performance, should mean that the sky is the limit.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nano banana from LM Arena 🍌Feels like an on-device (nano) image generation model to power upcoming Google Pixel 10 devices.

My concern is that even with the aforementioned improvements, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulating higher-end systems</a> with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's massive screen will result in disappointment.</p><p>What I'm hoping for is that even if the Tensor G5 trails behind the Snapdragon 8 Elite on paper, it will close the gap in a massive way. Then Google takes what it's learned from this go 'round, and puts Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple on notice with the Tensor G6. But until then, I'll just keep watching the clock tick until next week's announcement.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming Pixel 10 refresh, check out our</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8a97b89b-acd2-493d-b028-214542966a15" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" data-dimension48="Okay, I know what I said about being excited for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

According to DCS, Samsung has supposedly "registered" the device well ahead of its expected debut date, which could be in January 2026, if history continues to repeat itself. The rumor claims the S26 Pro could feature a 4,300mAh battery capacity, which is apparently "rated" at 4,175mAh.</p><p>Usually, consumers will see the "typical" rating, which, in this case, is 4,300mAh.</p><p>The leaks add that the Galaxy S26 Pro was listed with a 6.2-inch display. The tipster didn't have much more to add based on this rumored Chinese registration. Still, we're pretty far from any eventual launch of even Samsung's teasers. We can take these early specs with a grain of salt for now.</p><h2 id="new-name-but-familiar-specs-2">New Name... but familiar specs?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-displays-01" alt="Comparing the display size on the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumor-galaxy-s26-edge-s26-pro-battery-specifications-alleged-increases">rumors surfaced</a> about the Galaxy S26 Pro and Samsung's next Edge model. Those rumors claimed that the S26 Pro was discovered with a 4,300mAh battery. Why this is so significant is because of a previous rumor that says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">Samsung could vastly switch up</a> its S26 series by dropping the S26 and S26 Plus for the S26 Pro and S26 Edge.</p><p>If the S26 Pro is replacing (what would be) the base S26 model, then this rumored battery capacity is slightly higher than the vanilla S25. When it comes to the S26 Edge, those rumors said it could see a 4,200mAh battery. A big jump from its current 3,900mAh. However, this is still under the S25 Plus' 4,900mAh battery.</p><p>Perhaps Samsung could lean on its alleged "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>" battery tech that a report said the OEM was considering back in May. This battery tech would lead to "significantly" bigger batteries in the S26 series, while also boosting charging capabilities.

Again, Google is sticking with its promotional tagline: "Ask more of your phone." The teaser runs through its first feature, which seems to touch on the phone's telephoto lens. Google asks, "What if the camera could get super, super, super close" to your subject, while you're undoubtedly pretty far away.</p><p>The teaser doesn't expand on that, but the clip rolls into quite a familiar feature that we've even seen tested during an I/O keynote.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s amazing what you can create when you ask the right questions.

In 2024, after the Made by Google event of that year, the Pixel 9 went live for pre-orders, but not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">before we saw Add Me showcased</a> during the keynote. Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand said it best: Add Me is "AI that people can understand." The Pixel 9 is capable of taking a group photo once, and then allowing the photographer to step in somewhere and snap another.</p><p>It then leverages its AI software to graciously merge those two photos to a point where it looks like <em>someone else </em>took the photo. Like a video game where it's just some camera floating by a string. While this feels like a feature we should've expected on the Pixel 10, it's nice to see Google (sort of) say so.</p><p>Let's also not forget about the foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/key-specs-of-the-upcoming-pixel-10-pro-fold-unveiled">has had some rumors</a> surface quite recently. Those reports highlighted the existence of Qi2 support and a potential delay in its market release that consumers <em>might </em>need to keep in the back of their minds.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

One of its major updates is "Guided Learning" for students, which they can use to ask for step-by-step help with Gemini. Students looking to study with a little more depth (and assistance) can provide Gemini with all the details they can before, and let the AI break it down in a more digestible fashion.</p><p>Google states in today's post that Gemini will also create "images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes" to further enhance a student's learning experience.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is highlighting its newest Storybook update for Gemini. Parents can now create illustrated and AI-voiced storybooks for their kids using their own photos, their child's drawings, and more. The company states that parents can tell Gemin to create a specific story based on a photo, and tell the AI their child's age and interests to help create a short storybook they might enjoy.</p><p>This storybook feature is available for users globally on computers and mobile devices.</p><h2 id="from-fun-intuitive-to-new-gemini-intelligence-2">From Fun & Intuitive to new Gemini intelligence</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is an update that concerns Gemini Ultra subscribers this month, and that's the AI's "Deep Thinking" upgrade. As Google states, Deep Thinking enables the AI to understand and provide better answers for users with complex math and coding problems. The company states Deep Thinking upgrades Gemini's "reasoning," likely making the answers it returns more comprehensive.</p><p>A big Gemini update just started rolling out this week, which Google briefly mentions, and that involves "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-personal-context-uses-old-chats-future-personalized-answers-update">personal context</a>." Essentially, the personal context feature enables Gemini to remember and callback to previous chats you've had with it. These older chats will help it remember key details about you automatically without you needing to repeat yourself. If you've previously asked Gemini for a recipe, but said you were allergic to a specific seasoning, the next time you look for inspiration, Gemini will (ideally) keep that allergy in mind.</p><p>Of course, the AI can still mess up, so it's always worth keeping an eye out for that. Additionally, "Temporary Chats" arrive, giving users a little more privacy when asking questions that you don't want Gemini to remember. Temporary Chats were announced on August 13, but Google states this will take some time to reach more users, so it might take a few weeks.</p><p>Google first introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-brings-first-of-its-kind-gemini-drops-for-its-ai-updates">Gemini Drops in July</a>, where it creates a complete roundup of the latest updates for the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication's snapshots allege that the Pixel 10 Pro XL will be the "giant" in this new series, which sounds pretty much like what we got last year. The leak states the 10 Pro XL is listed with a 5,078mAh battery; however, its supposed "energy efficiency" rating is only a "B." The publication adds that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has been estimated to last roughly 48 hours before needing a charge.</p><p>On the other hand, there's the Pixel 10 Pro, which has supposedly received a 4,707mAh battery, estimated to last 51 hours. The extended life on its battery per charge seems to tie into its "A" rank battery efficiency.</p><p>Curiously, the leak states the base Pixel 10 offers a slightly higher 4,835mAh battery (over the Pro model) with an "A" in efficiency and an estimated 49 hours before needing to charge. The alleged battery for the base model is 135mAh larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.

In that one, the Pixel 10 Pro's 6.3-inch display was alleged, as well as a 4,870mAh battery. This creates quite a strange narrative, considering the latest leaks claim this capacity is slightly lower than originally theorized. If anything, it's dropped the Pixel 10 Pro under the base model, which seems strange when you think about it.</p><p>The rumors from June add that the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL could see 29W and 39W charging capabilities, respectively.</p><p>The 10 Pro Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/key-specs-of-the-upcoming-pixel-10-pro-fold-unveiled">hasn't been left out</a>, as a more recent leak seemingly shone a light on its entire spec sheet. It seems this model could receive an IP68 rating and support for Qi2 wireless charging.

A solid pair of earbuds with noise cancellation are simply essential when you're trying to get some studying done in a noisy environment, and they come in handy when you're trying to listen to music or watch your favorite show without disturbing your roommates.

If you want to listen to music while working out, for instance, or if you need something compact and portable, earbuds are the only thing that do the trick. The problem is that most buds are uncomfortable or they won't stay in place, and you'll never find a pair of earbuds that sound as good as my Sony XM5s. That's where the Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in.</p><p>While they still can't quite meet the sound quality offered by headphones, these versatile earbuds are the only pair that I've worn comfortably for hours on end. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 don't fall out of my ears when I go for a run, the ANC (active noise cancellation) works great, and they connect almost instantaneously to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-8" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can fine-tune the EQ settings using the companion app, and the 11mm dynamic drivers deliver big, well-rounded sound that belies the buds' small frame. The included charging case could also get you up with 48 hours of battery life on a single charge, which is pretty impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-vs-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro">compared to something like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Of course, they're not for everyone.

Other brands that follow annual product cycles might want to consider the same approach.</p><p>I say that because the Sony WH-1000XM6 come with lofty expectations based on the world-class active noise cancelation (ANC) and sound quality the line is known for.

The WH-1000XM6 fold flat <em>and </em>inward to reduce their footprint and make them easier to travel with. The hinge is also more durable this time, and the headband gets a wider profile that helps reduce any feeling of clamping on your head.</p><p>The rest of the design largely follows previous models, including a matte finish and similarly-sized ear cups and replaceable pads with familiar memory foam.</p><p>A brief note about the case. It’s similar to previous ones, except for how the XM6’s fold to lessen the overall footprint. The latch closing them shut feels like an easier method than the all-around zipper, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ambient-passthrough" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internally, Sony jumps from eight microphones in the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a> to 12 mics in the XM6, spreading them out by laying out eight on the outside of the ear cups and four inside the cups to help capture all the ambient noise and reduce it to mere silence. That’s where the new QN3 processor comes in — the noise-canceling brain that does the legwork behind the scenes.</p><p>On a recent flight, I could barely notice the droning sound of the plane’s engine or hear the person sitting next to me. And rather than pause playback or remove the headphones, I would just put my hand over the right cup to automatically lower the volume and briefly disable ANC to hear an announcement or exchange a few words with someone.</p><p>If I choose to take them off, the wear sensors are as good as ever, immediately pausing playback and resuming instantly once back in place.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ear-cup-fit" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one remaining challenge is high-frequency sounds, like sirens, screaming kids, and screeching train tracks. The XM6s do a great job muffling them down to more insignificant levels, though it also depends on how loud your audio volume is. If those sounds remain continuous or repetitive, you’ll find yourself raising the volume to dampen them further, which could be a problem if you go too loud for longer stretches.</p><p>Sony’s Sound Connect app is rife with a variety of cool settings, though I wish it would clean up the interface to lay it all out in a more constructive way. As is, it feels aged, crowded, and lacking intuition, but you’ll need to navigate through it to find important pieces to utilize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-1" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app equalizer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests. This differs from other brands that use onboard mics to measure the shape of your ears and hearing ability in that it leans more toward a sound signature than personal tuning. I recommend going through this process — or at the very least, tinkering with the EQ to see what suits your own taste for tuning.</p><p>It's not that the XM6 don’t sound good out of the box. It’s just that, like a lot of over-ears these days, the flatter EQ may not fully realize its potential. More dynamic bass, mids, or treble would require you to find that balance on your own. It’s certainly there, given Sony’s excellent foundational tuning, so the odds of you coming away with amazing sound quality are quite high.</p><p>A big reason is that the 30mm drivers are so clean. Sony changed the architecture inside without overtly affecting how the sound travels to your ears, helping retain the clear and resonant quality established throughout the 1000XM line.</p><div><blockquote><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests.</p></blockquote></div><p>That also explains why all audio passing through the drivers feels consistent, whether it’s 360 Reality spatial audio or hi-res tracks using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a>. It’s too bad (though hardly surprising) that there’s no aptX HD support to broaden hi-res options, but since LDAC is a Sony codec, the exclusivity is on brand. This still gives Android users a leg up in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone"> hi-res support</a> compared to iOS users, who can’t access the same quality.</p><p>The clarity extends to phone and video calls, which improve in two distinct ways. Extra mics mean you should come in clearer for those on the other end, while better sound makes them feel clearer to you. Sony pulls this off by way of an AI model that identifies voices and separates them from the surrounding ambient noise. It works in the background, proving to be an integral reason why busy streets and even gusty winds won’t succeed in ruining the conversation.</p><p>For anyone on the go or working in an office, it’s the kind of reliability you want when communication is key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-2" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app auto-play settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can take all that further through the Scenes feature on the app, an expansion of Auto-play as it was previously known. Within it is Adaptive Sound Control to automatically adjust noise cancellation and ambient sound settings based on your location, and whether you’re walking, running, sitting, commuting, or working out.</p><p>The Auto-play portion starts playback from your preferred service (Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, or Endel) once you put the headphones on. Voice Cue reads out incoming notifications, including messages, which is convenient when you don’t want to pull your phone out. This way, you could verbalize a response through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> while keeping your hands free. It takes a while to figure out how all these things work, but they are worth trying given their uniqueness.</p><p>The onboard controls are a mix of two physical buttons and touch panels on the right ear cup. Both buttons are distinct to ensure you don’t press the wrong one. Press the ANC button to toggle between it and ambient sound, or hold it down to mute during phone calls. You can also set it so that a double or triple-press launches one of the supported music services. Press the power button once, and you’ll hear battery life levels.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-buttons" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the touch-enabled controls on the right ear cup let you play/pause with a double-tap on either side. Simply swipe up or down to raise or lower the volume, or forward to skip a track and back to repeat one. You can also swipe forward or back and hold your finger to fast-forward or rewind, or press and hold on the earcup to activate Gemini or whichever voice assistant you use.</p><p>It’s common for touch controls to act finicky, yet these seem almost incapable of doing anything wrong. While you can turn them off entirely, you can’t adjust their sensitivity in case you feel they’re too effective. Nor can you change or reassign them.</p><p>Fortunately, despite all the extras going on here, battery life holds steady, largely managing up to 30 hours with ANC on. You can feel assured they’ll last for a long-haul flight or daily commute, but it’s worth noting that some competitors offer significantly more battery life per charge.</p><p>One thing I do like is that Sony retains the ability to charge and use the headphones at the same time, meaning you could charge them through your laptop while simultaneously listening to music or making a call. In a pinch, Sony claims you can get up to three hours of playback on a quick three-minute charge, which I can confirm is about right.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-wh-1000xm6-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Sony WH-1000XM6: What I don't like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-hanging" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 hanging on a chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/everyone-needs-3-pairs-of-wireless-headphones-here-are-my-picks"><strong>Here's why you should own at least 3 pairs of headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio terms and codecs explained: aptX, LDAC, LC3, and everything else</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Finding fault in these headphones kind of feels like nitpicking, but no product is ever truly perfect, and even the WH-1000XM6 headphones will show a crack or two. I don’t have enough hair on the top of my head for additional padding, so the headband tends to be the one thing I adjust more often because of the thinner foam layer Sony goes with here. Your experience may vary.</p><p>A major disappointment is the lack of USB-C wired playback. I noted earlier that you could charge and listen at the same time, but that doesn’t mean the audio runs through the USB port. You would have to connect via Bluetooth or use the 3.5mm cable instead. That’s a real bummer for anyone wanting to do so on a phone or tablet without a headphone jack, forcing you to use a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter as a workaround.</p><p>If you’re thinking of these as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout headphones</a>, keep in mind there is no IP rating for them. How well they can handle sweat is hard to gauge, and without the protection, you’ve got nothing to mitigate damage in the one-year warranty, so a cautious approach is wise to protect your investment.</p><p>Lastly, while I already touched on this, the app needs some sort of streamlined overhaul. The number of features is too numerous to cover them all in detail, but I can understand how some might view them as confusing while navigating through Sound Connect.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-wh-1000xm6-competition"><span>Sony WH-1000XM6: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.82%;"><img id="isvq6hLzEzdGRbydwEiF7M" name="Bose-QuietComfort-Ultra-headphones-hero.jpg" alt="Side view of Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones laying flat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/isvq6hLzEzdGRbydwEiF7M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="877" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sony’s flagship over-ears regularly earn their stripes among the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"> best headphones</a> in the industry, and that’s not going to change here.

The color of each container has a slightly different background from the main page, making them more prominent.</p><h2 id="google-contacts-just-got-more-brighter-and-expressive-2">Google Contacts just got more brighter and expressive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.95%;"><img id="y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm" name="google-contacts-material-3-expressive" alt="New Material 3 Expressive design in the Google Contacts app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="2360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There aren't major visual changes in the Highlights and Organize tabs — apart from each section and contact using the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> containers — while the "Create contact" page remains untouched. The actual contact info page, however, has some new UI changes.</p><p>The icons for Call, Message, Video, and Email are now larger and pill-shaped, similar to other apps updated with Material 3 Expressive design. The new shape makes them more prominent and easier to tap.</p><p>Other changes include the removal of the "Contact info" label above the phone number, while remaining details on the contact info page are placed in matching containers like the rest of the app.</p><p>If you don't see the new UI yet, it's because it's rolling out with the 4.6.1.x version via the Google Play Store. Updating should bring the refreshed design.</p><h2 id="incoming-call-screen-is-also-getting-a-major-design-upgrade-2">Incoming Call screen is also getting a major design upgrade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nvaGK8VrxXfjmpK86chK6U" name="google-phone-contacts-calling-card" alt="New calling card screens for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nvaGK8VrxXfjmpK86chK6U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Alongside this redesign, Google is also testing new calling cards for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-phone-apps-simpler-layout-is-now-hitting-more-devices">Phone app</a>. Currently, when you get a phone call, you only see a small profile image of the caller in the middle of the screen (if you've added one) and nothing more. By contrast, iPhones show a full-screen contact image, making calls feel more personal.</p><p>Google appears to be adding a similar option on Android. In another report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/14/google-phone-calling-card/">9to5Google</a> has detailed that customizable calling cards are rolling out to some Phone beta users.</p><p>Calling cards let users add a full-screen image of the caller. They can also choose from different fonts and colors, making the entire incoming call screen more customizable. Once the update rolls out, the Contacts app will prompt users to create calling cards directly from the contact info page.</p><p>The new calling cards aren't widely available yet, showing up only for some people on the Phone by Google 188 beta app version. There's no official word on when they'll roll out, but with the Pixel 10's release approaching, it could happen sooner rather than later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature is rolling out now for consumers in the U.S., EU, U.K., Canada, and Australia. Ultrahuman states viO is designed for women with "diverse cycle patterns" as most tracking services are only centered around regular 28-day cycles.</p><p>Behind the Cycle & Ovulation Pro feature is Ultrahuman's "15 years of R&D." The press release states the feature utilizes a temperature-sensing algorithm that was originally for viO's OvuSense. This algorithm has reportedly cleared the FDA hurdles for "intervaginal temperature-based ovulation tracking."</p><p>This algorithm will monitor and display changes within a woman's body as time goes on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">Ultrahuman</a> states women should gain a better understanding of their cycles and ovulation periods as their lives continue to evolve. Cycle & Ovulation Pro is said to collect a woman's "physiological patterns and temperature biomarkers" through the Ring Air. This provides tracking on the Ring Air that is estimated to be 90% or higher in accuracy. Additionally, Cycle & Ovulation Pro will offer fertility planning support for women, guiding them through various cycle types for "accurate ovulation confirmations."</p><h2 id="logging-changes-understanding-patterns-2">Logging changes & Understanding Patterns</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-tracking" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug for the Ultrahuman Ring Air lets women understand their cycle via tracking, data, patterns, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-confirmation" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug is arriving for the Ring Air, giving women better understanding with ovulation confirmations and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Cycle Flags are another aspect of this Pro feature. Ultrahuman says Cycle Flags take into account your temperature data to "suggest hidden patterns" to help you understand cycle variability. Certain trends can include "early or late ovulation, short luteal phase, the absence of ovulation," and more. As previously mentioned, the Cycle & Ovulation Pro feature is designed to help all women, even those outside of the "normal" 28-cycle period.</p><p>Ultrahuman says its feature is designed to help women with PCOS or endometriosis.</p><p>Lastly, Cycle & Ovulation Pro contains a logging feature, letting women note their moods, symptoms, and any changes in behavior. These changes could correlate with "cycle phases," per Ultrahuman, and could help women better identify "long-term" wellness trends.</p><p>Cycle & Ovulation Pro is available for users with the Ultrahuman Ring Air in the U.S., EU, U.K., Canada, and Australia for $3.99 per month or $39 per year. The company teases that other regions are to come. More importantly, those using the regular Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug can still do so without any disruptions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google says the new Flight Deals tool is built for people willing to play with different dates, destinations, and filters to save cash.</p><p>Powered by AI (likely Gemini), you can put in your query in natural language and simply describe where you want to go. Instead of entering a destination, dates, or other specifics, you could search for "week-long trip this winter to a city with great food, nonstop only" or "10-day ski trip to a world-class resort," and Google Flights will find you the best deals available.</p><p>Google describes talking to Flight Deals "as though you’re talking to a friend."</p><h2 id="flight-deals-lets-you-find-low-fares-with-just-a-few-words-2">Flight Deals lets you find low fares with just a few words</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.38%;"><img id="zwbiKc2P8ZinT6TanfWUtA" name="google-flights-deals-video" alt="Video showing how Google Flight Deals work" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zwbiKc2P8ZinT6TanfWUtA.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says Flight Deals will show "best bargains" that match your search and may even highlight destinations you might not have considered before putting in the query.</p><p>The company says this tool is specifically for travelers planning vacations without fixed dates or destinations. If this fits you, Flight Deals will tap into "hundreds of airlines and booking sites" to get you the best options. However, if you already know exactly where or when you want to go, Flight Deals may not be the best tool.</p><p>Flight Deals will be available within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-flights-booking-insights">Google Flights</a> in beta starting next week for users in the U.S., Canada, and India.

The most recent one comes from WinFuture, which seems to have got a hold of the entire spec sheet of Google's upcoming foldable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>The spec sheet posted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,152955.html">publication</a> backs all the previous rumors we've heard about the device. To begin with, its display, the foldable is expected to have a larger 6.4-inch external display with a maximum refresh rate of 60 to 100 Hertz and an increased maximum brightness. The resolution of the outer screen is expected to be 2364x1080 pixels, sporting 3000 nits of max brightness.</p><p>As previous leaks have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to see thinner bezels on the external screen, which gives users a wider screen to play with. This was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-in-its-first-official-teaser-before-launch">confirmed in Google's teaser</a> that was posted two days ago,  giving viewers a full look at its rear panel and internal display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold" alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leak also details the device's internal display, which is said to be identical to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, measuring 8 inches diagonally, but could see increased brightness reaching 3000 nits. Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will supposedly sport the new G5 Tensor chipset with a Titan M2 chip for security. As seen in Evan Blass' leak last week, this one all but confirms the fact that the device will show up with a 5015 mAh battery that can last for over 24 hours and up to 72 hours with extreme power saving mode."</p><p>Additionally, the website notes that the Fold will reach 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W USB-C PPS charger. Speaking of charging, chatter on the block is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable ever to get Qi2 support, with the rumored "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">PixelSnap</a>,"  wireless charging system, which allows charging at 15 W.</p><p>The website states that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will show up with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, which would be a game-changer if it were true, considering the device would be the first foldable to ever see such durability. This is backed by its aviation-grade aluminum body, ultra-thin internal glass, as well as foldable glass.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-teaser-hero" alt="An image of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold from Google in its rumored Moonstone color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other known and rumored specs include the device's camera array, which is said to remain the same as its predecessor, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto zoom lens. The website notes a possible change with the maximum optical magnification, which could be up by a factor of 10. This could give us zoomed-in images with better detail.</p><p>The device is expected to come in three storage options (256GB / 512GB / 1TB) and two colorways: Moonstone and Jade. The leak claims that the device will get 7 years of Android updates, as well as security updates and feature drops. Lastly, the device is said to come with Android 16 out of the box and Gemini's latest capabilities. While the device is all set to launch in a week, you might to be able to get your hands on one until <em><strong>October</strong></em>, as the tech giant has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues">reportedly run into "supply chain issues."</a></p><p>While this leak seems extremely comprehensive, it's important to note that some features mentioned in leaks don't make it to the device itself.

Launched earlier this morning (Aug 14), HTC highlights the VIVE Eagle as "AI-driven wearable eyewear." Since this is—let's say—an alternate route from HTC's VR headsets, the company's senior vice president, Chris Huang, said, “VIVE Eagle represents HTC’s newest exploration in the realm of intelligent living and personal wearables."</p><p>The VIVE Eagle touts a "premium design" at a lightweight 49 grams. HTC states users can alter its comfort by adjusting its nosepads and contoured temples for a fit that'll last you all day. Additionally, the post highlights the inclusion of ZEISS sun lenses, which provide UV protection "without compromising optical clarity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3" name="htc-vive-eagle-black-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle smart glasses in a black option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Packed into the VIVE Eagle is voice-activated AI with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>. HTC states its AI support can help users capture life's moments with a simple phrase: "Hey VIVE, take a photo." The VIVE Eagle will capture your photos using its 12MP ultra-wide camera, thanks to VIVE AI.</p><p>Recording is another capability of the VIVE Eagle. The press release states users can ask their glasses to record a reminder, take notes, and more just by using their voices.</p><h2 id="music-prviacy-2">Music & Prviacy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7" name="htc-vive-eagle-berry-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle in its Berry color option on a female model." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than capturing memories, HTC states its newest AI glasses can even carry your favorite tracks for you. The post highlights the VIVE Eagle's open-ear design with "large acoustic drivers and virtual bass" for richer audio. The company also states the glasses' audio capabilities help to minimize sound leakage, meaning you (hopefully) won't disturb others around you. While out, the VIVE Eagle's speakers can deliver your music in full volume; however, you should still have the awareness to understand what's happening around you.</p><p>Speaking of staying a little private, the glasses reportedly sport AES-256 encryption to safeguard your data stored locally within the device. More importantly, HTC says the content you capture with the VIVE Eagle is "never uploaded, tracked, or used for AI model training."</p><p>Some smaller AI specifications state the VIVE Eagle supports real-time translation for 13 languages. The content the glasses capture via the cameras is then translated and fed to the user through its speakers. HTC states its support encompasses Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.</p><h2 id="taiwan-pre-orders-2">Taiwan Pre-orders</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4RiPNd7pRhA9nLqvfSxFd9" name="htc-vive-eagle-two-frames" alt="Two pairs of HTC VIVE Eagle smart glasses against an orange and blue background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RiPNd7pRhA9nLqvfSxFd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While staying lightweight, the VIVE Eagle contains a 235mAh battery with up to 36 hours of standby time.

Unlike Perplexity, which did not disclose its backers — despite being valued at less than half its bid — Search.com confirmed its bid is "backed by JP Morgan."</p><p>Search.com says over 65% of the world's population uses Google Chrome, and embedding AI into the browser must be "equitable" as it could determine how more than 3 billion people access information in the future.</p><p>The company says that if the bid goes through, Search.com - owned Chrome will offer users cash back for using the browser. It also said it would end the "ad-cluttered web experience" and offer publishers revenue sharing, which has been a long-standing issue since the rise of AI tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode in Google Search</a>.</p><h2 id="search-com-says-it-ll-offer-perks-for-users-and-publishers-2">Search.com says it'll offer perks for users and publishers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z" name="chrome-app-icon-android" alt="Google Chrome for Android app icon on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to Perplexity's bid, Google hasn't commented on Search.com's offer yet.

As such, the FDA reportedly told Whoop that it should seek "prompt action" to rectify this issue.</p><p>Bloomberg notes a statement from an FDA spokesperson today (Aug 13), which says the agency "has not authorized BPI for any use, including for the measurement or estimation of a user’s blood pressure."</p><p>On Whoop's side, the company says the FDA has "misinterpreted" its blood pressure estimation tool as a "medical tool." More importantly, Whoop adds that its Blood Pressure Insights feature is labeled as a wellness-focused tool, and that it is not intended to diagnose more severe cardiovascular medical issues. The publication cites a letter written by Whoop to the FDA on August 4, which reads, "We believe it is not within the FDA’s authority to regulate the product. We therefore do not intend to remove the app."</p><p>The post highlights Whoop's intention to meet with the FDA, in hopes of having "a constructive dialogue" with its officials.</p><h2 id="wellness-or-medical-2">Wellness or Medical?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA" name="whoop-5-0-mg-official-launch-rendering" alt="A rendering of the Whoop 5.0/MG bands from its May launch in black and white color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1655" height="931" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Whoop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To expand on this, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whoop.com/eu/en/thelocker/introducing-whoop-5-0-and-whoop-mg/">Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG</a> launched earlier this year in May. The Whoop MG is the main highlight for this particular topic since it introduced the company's Blood Pressure Insights. Per the company, the BPI feature is designed to provide "daily estimates of systolic and diastolic ranges right from your wrist." Its launch post states these estimations may help users "understand your recovery, sleep, stress, and more."</p><p>While Whoop's fine print states its BPI is "not a medical device," echoing its statement to the FDA, the agency continues to hammer home the fact that the device "does not fall under the general wellness device policy..."</p><p>Bloomberg highlights that the feature is only available for Whoop Life plan members, which costs a whopping $359 per year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All the secrets Google is likely trying to hold close to its proverbial chest are being pried away and revealed ahead of the announcement, and that includes one big surprise for the company's third-generation foldable: a new hinge.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android Central Labs</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9" name="android-central-labs-lloyd-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="Android Central's Lloyd mascot wearing a lab coat for the Android Central Labs column" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WCXSEZSk3FX9EmxxzaGE9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-central-labs">Android Central Labs</a> is a weekly column devoted to deep dives, experiments, and a focused look into the tech you use.

It's rumored to be a <em>fully dust-resistant</em> hinge, something the industry at large has struggled to figure out. We first saw this leak <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-folds-durability-rating-might-give-you-more-peace-of-mind">appear in late June</a>, noting that the upcoming Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold would be IP68 water and dust-resistant, marking a first for any foldable phone.</p><p>This comes on the heels of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's release, which didn't move the needle for dust resistance at all, packing in the same IP48 rating as the Fold 6. For note, the 4 in the IP48 rating means that the device is dust resistant down to 1mm particles, which is good enough for most things, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8hgg4YEdPak?si=San_k1f23fA-tNww&t=367">JerryRigEverything's video shows</a> (timestamp 6 minutes).</p><p>But I expected the first fully dust-resistant hinge to come from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor Magic V5</a>, or a company like Oppo or Vivo. Definitely <em>not</em> Google, as the company is rarely among the hardware engineering elite. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> unabashedly looked like an iPhone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> hardly stood out among a crowd of far more unique foldable phones.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-a-foldable-hinge-2">What's in a foldable hinge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM" name="foldable-phone-hinges-mr-mobile-youtube" alt="A screenshot showing foldable hinges from Mr Mobile's video "Inside A Folding Phone: The Hinge That Helped Oppo 'Delete The Crease'"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mr Mobile / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nearly every foldable phone on the market uses a different kind of hinge. While all early foldables used gears, most recent foldable phones have switched to a gearless system. While gears make it easy to lock the hinge in place, they also provide a point that allows dust to enter or, at the very least, a point of failure if dust were to ever get inside the hinge.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, Samsung has been using gearless hinges. They're interlocking metal parts that slide together and stay open via cleverly designed angles. You can see them in action in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/1C1XpwR55ZY?si=qFQt9_1j7ep9G253&t=538">JerryRigEverything's Z Fold 4 video</a> (timestamp 9 minutes), and Google has been using gearless hinges in its Pixel Fold phones for the last two years, as well.</p><p>But Pixels aren't historically known for their durability or long-term use. From overheating processors to problems with warranty claims and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-volume-rocker-falling-off">parts falling off</a>, Google doesn't exactly have a great name in this area. Again, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/NJK_sLBJvsw?si=tLlEzVjF7Jx4NZ3g&t=355">JerryRigEverything's Pixel 9 Pro Fold video</a> (timestamp 6 minutes) shows, Google has work to do on durability when compared to the competition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-titanium-hinge" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 titanium hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 with its titanium hinge and visible gears. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, how in the world is it that Google will supposedly be the one with the first <em>dustproof</em> hinge? The "6" in that rumored IP68 rating means the hinge is completely sealed off from dust of any type or size, which means the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge is going to be as airtight as the International Space Station.</p><p>Hyperbole aside, that takes a lot of bespoke engineering hours to accomplish and, again, is something that not even Huawei, Honor, Vivo, Oppo, or Samsung have been able to accomplish with all the money they've dumped into foldable phone R&D over the years. I'm not saying it's out of the realm of possibility at all, but I certainly didn't expect it from Google's Pixel engineering team, which is <em>only</em> on its third generation foldable product.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-durability-is-just-part-of-the-picture-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold durability is just part of the picture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But let's be fair to Google, it looks like the Pixel 10 is going to bring Google into an entirely new realm of engineering excellence.

Does it know the "future" because it was programmed to, or is it using a complex neural network to determine a possible future based on all the knowledge it has in its seemingly endless database?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>But then it dawned on me: I was talking to an <em>actual robot</em>. It didn't matter how it thought; it was all about how realistic it felt and how close this was to the sci-fi movies we've all grown up watching. These robots were seemingly pulled straight out of the Star Wars universe and could not only function within their designed parameters, but could also psychologically process and respond to any question I asked them.</p><p>This was more than just a ChatGPT moment for me. It was a surreal representation of a future I didn't genuinely think I'd ever live to see; yet, before me was a collection of robots, each with its own job and seemingly functional brain.</p><p>The only way this could have felt more realistic to me is if these were <strong>physical</strong> robots in front of me in a cafe, but thankfully, their heavy mechanical bodies were still confined to the boundaries of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> headset. For now, at least. And soon, everyone will be able to check out the full experience in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stellar-cafe/23951924494476537/">Stellar Cafe</a> when it launches on the Meta Quest platform later this year.</p><h2 id="just-another-day-in-stellar-cafe-2">Just another day in Stellar Cafe</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti38XOKwXwI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo opened with me sitting in an elevator. As the doors opened to Stellar Cafe, I could see the friendly bartender wave to me in an attempt to usher me into the room. But, like those strange dreams we all sometimes have, none of my appendages (or virtual inputs) seemed to be working.</p><p>So I asked my handy virtual assistant how to get to the bar and, much to my surprise, my assistant <em>warped me</em> <em>to it</em>. Now I know I can move around just by asking, and the future-forward flavor of this demo has only just begun.</p><p>Immediately, James, the bartender, introduces himself and asks me what I want to drink. Having never visited Stellar Cafe before, I thought my safest bet was to order from the menu, so a Meteor Mocha it was. That is, until I read the ingredients on the side of my cup and realized it had oat milk in it.</p><div><blockquote><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with synthetic milk instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. </p></blockquote></div><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with <em>synthetic milk </em>instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. Heck, I've been to more than a few coffee places that didn't even realize someone could be allergic to oat milk, and you'd think they would be the ones on top of that stuff.</p><p>My conversations with the three other robots in the room were similarly impressive. One robot was sitting next to a scenic view of a few planets, and I wondered if it would know more about them. Turns out it did, and not only that, it wasn't just hallucinating answers the entire time. After describing the planet Golga (I think it said Golga) as "a soulless planet filled with corporate resorts and pristine beaches," I asked it which planet it was referring to.</p><p>To my surprise, it not only told me that the purple planet was Golga, but the green planet next to it was "just some backwater mining colony" that seemed to provide all the resources needed for the corporate overlords running the planet next door.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of a robot writing a letter quitting its job" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, all the robots remembered my name as Devin, a misnomer that occurred when I was interviewing Astrobeam's CEO, Devin Reimer, and the game overheard me asking him about something at the bar. Apparently, James asked me my name, and I didn't have the heart to correct him, although it would have been easy enough to do so.</p><p>But Stellar Cafe isn't just some LLM experiment that you'll want to play for 5 minutes and move on to the next thing. Reimer told me the game always takes place in the cafe (hence, the name), but the robots you'll see are always changing. Like a normal cafe, there might be some regulars, but there are plenty of fresh faces (or face screens, as the robots call them) to meet all the time.</p><p>The demo's main objective was to convince all the robots in the room to RSVP for that evening's party. The demo ends once you complete this task, but the full game will venture on to that party and introduce a whole host of new characters and places. Regardless of your location, your goal is to chat with robots and help solve problems through conversation — a core tenet of being human, I'd say.</p><h2 id="a-uniquely-stellar-game-2">A uniquely stellar game</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the fortune teller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the entire experience, I couldn't get over how profoundly different it was to navigate with my voice. To date, I haven't seen any other games — VR or otherwise — that used voice quite like this. Oftentimes, when you see voice interaction in games, it's just to complete commands.</p><p>In Espire 2, one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, you sneak around like Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid, and can tell guards to "put their hands up," or "freeze," to make them surrender. But these are very specific commands, and you can't just ask your in-game robot companion to go do something for you.</p><p>In Stellar Cafe, that's the whole premise behind the concept, something Reimer says the studio has been working on for the past two years. LLMs like ChatGPT are based on natural language input, and Reimer says the team has constructed a bespoke model that runs efficiently enough to make this a one-time purchase title. Not only that, but it's fast enough to keep responses from making you wait. Ask a robot something, and it replies right away. It's pretty stellar.</p><div><blockquote><p>Each robot's responses are not only quick and impressively natural-feeling, but they run on an efficient custom LLM that will keep this as a one-time purchase game.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not only can you ask your virtual assistant, Visor, to transport you around the room, but you can make these commands with as much or as little knowledge as you might have of the game's content. "Bring me to the window with the orange robot" works just as well as "Sit me at the third seat at the bar with James," or "take me to that fortune teller robot."</p><p>Keeping the conversations compelling and feeling natural relied on an input that <em>felt </em>more natural. When gamers feel bored during a conversation in VR, they often "run around and jump off of stuff," as Reimer noted.</p><p>So if the script is flipped and you can't do that, you'll find yourself fidgeting in your seat, twiddling your thumbs, or picking up objects as you have a conversation, instead. "It's like what you do when normally chatting with people you're seated across from," Reimer added, and I couldn't agree more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the entire cafe and its robot denizens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After spending 30 minutes convincing robots they needed to go to the biggest party of the year, I was convinced that I needed to play the full Stellar Cafe game when it debuted later this year. Reimer's previous chops are rooted in Job Simulator and other Owlchemy Games titles, and it shows in his new company's first release.</p><p>Gone are the days of dialog trees and repeating NPC talk in games. Instead, these characters feel like actual sentient beings in a fantasy world. It's a new era of VR gaming and a unique chapter in the history of the medium, as well, and I can't wait to be a part of it!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post cites an "industry insider," who stated, "While Samsung is responsible for the hardware portion of its partnership with Google, Google also conducts internal hardware research and prepares for the future, so Samsung must also develop its own brand."</p><p>With Samsung seemingly looking to step away from Google—at least for this supposed device—rumors theorize on its design, which could be "display-less."

In March, a report claimed that Samsung was developing a pair of smart glasses under the project name "HAEAN." These glasses would be a mixed reality pair, something that could go up against the RayBan Meta alternative.</p><p>Project HAEAN is speculated to deliver displays that could showcase "information or images" on its lenses.

According to the Telegram post, the company is seemingly working on a way for users to practice new languages, similar to Duolingo. Mehrad was able to screenshot a "Practice Spanish" menu, which displays the user's goal (how well they want to speak), Daily Activities, and Words Practiced.</p><p>Also, it was nearly cut off, but there's a button that says "create your own practice scenario," which could come in handy if you're trying to gauge your abilities in specific situations.</p><p>On the other hand, the publication, alongside tipster AssembleDebug, dove into the Translate app's code to discover a new graduation cap icon representing "Practice." Google's tagline reads, "practice with AI-powered conversations." The app gives several "recommended" scenarios, encompassing both listening and speaking practices. When listening, users are given an audio clip and asked to tap which words they recognize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9" name="google-translate-practice-language-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google Translate's supposed "practice" feature to help users learn new languages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mehrad / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After it's done, and you've seen how well you faired, the Translate app lets users adjust the difficulty of its generated scenarios.</p><p>When creating a pretend custom speaking scenario, the tipster highlights the ability for users to write their own situation or choose a recommended one. From there, users are presented with a selection of "tasks" to complete before getting the chance to speak into the app. There's also a "proficiency" level users can select, which is how well they're able to speak the language they want to learn. The post states there were options present for "Just Starting, Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced."</p><p>The tipster also discovered a quiz function that's created using "rounds." From both Mehrad's screenshot on Telegram and the tipster's APK deep dive, it seems Google Translate's language learning feature is nearly completed. There's no telling when it could arrive officially, but perhaps it's soon.</p><h2 id="breaking-barriers-2">Breaking barriers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP" name="google-pixel-6-pro-translate-03.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro Translate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier in June, we heard rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-design-shake-up-rumored-new-upgrades">about a design shakeup for the Google Translate</a> app that could incorporate more features.

It comes pre-installed on most Android phones, offers a clean and simple interface.</p><p>Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">Gemini integration</a> that we've been asking for on Google Keep hasn't arrived yet, the company continues to add useful features to the app every now and then. Recently, the app received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> update, and now a long-requested sorting feature is arriving.</p><p>With the new update, Keep users can sort notes by "date created" or "date modified". Previously, the app displayed notes in the order they were created, with the most recent at the top. Even if you updated an older note, its position wouldn't change, making it harder to quickly find your latest edits without searching or scrolling through multiple notes.</p><h2 id="sorting-finally-comes-to-google-keep-on-android-2">Sorting finally comes to Google Keep on Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.38%;"><img id="aPGaAEARUqhUxvuf8gHzch" name="google-keep-sort-notes" alt="Sorting Google Keep notes on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPGaAEARUqhUxvuf8gHzch.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new feature fixes that by allowing you to instantly see which note was updated recently. A sort icon now appears in the search bar next to your profile picture. Tapping this icon opens a dialog box where you can choose your sorting method.</p><p>Tapping once sorts from latest to oldest, and tapping again reverses it. From what we've seen, the sorting resets to default when you close the app, but you can easily change it again with a single tap.</p><p>The feature is rolling out now with the latest version of Google Keep on the Play Store, and it's currently exclusive to Android. Even though Keep relies heavily on web-based content, the feature isn't available on desktop, and even iOS users don't have it yet.</p><p>Considering Google often launches new features on iOS first, it's a nice change to see Android users getting the update ahead of everyone else.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company stated it was looking to release this new hub for its creative-focused features in August, and we're seeing that appear now in the bottom navigation bar.</p><p>From the "Create" tab, users will have easy access to features like Collage, Cinematic Photos, Animations (GIF creation), and Highlight Videos.</p><p>However, as the publication notes, Google Photos is looking to draw attention to its most recently added capabilities, like photo-to-video generation (which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">also in Gemini</a>). Users engaging with this feature can locate a photo in their gallery that they'd like the app to breathe some AI life into. Essentially, your photo will show some movement, making the person or people in it move a little or make a cool gesture, like celebrating.</p><p>Version 7.40 is also reportedly bringing a small plus icon at the top of the Create tab, right beside your Google Account icon. This is a drop-down menu that houses many of the same options you'd find just by scrolling the Create tab. The publication notes that while v7.40 of the Photos app has been spotted, it's not available for every device just yet, so more users will likely see it as we end the week.</p><h2 id="get-creating-2">Get Creating</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.77%;"><img id="9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H" name="google-photos-create-tab-example" alt="Google is preparing a new hub for AI generative functions in its Photos app called "Create."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Photos was part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">a huge announcement post</a> in July that detailed the creative updates that were inbound. In this post, the company detailed its upcoming photo-to-video generation capabilities and its Remix option, which could restyle your photos into Anime, 3D animation, and more. However, wrapping up all of this nicely is the "Create" tab.</p><p>All of the AI features that Google Photos provides will be housed directly in this new Create tab. Users can quickly hop into any of them from this tab, select the photos they'd like to mess with, and proceed without a hitch (hopefully). Google stated in July that the new tab would arrive for U.S. users first, before extending to other places.</p><p>There will almost certainly be a follow-up update at a later date from Google once other regions are ready to go.</p><p>Another post this week from Google gave users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-explains-how-remix-will-work-availability-upcoming">an in-depth look at how its Remix feature</a> will work in the app. Remix isn't widely available just yet, but this explainer makes sure we're ready to rock once it is.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is one of the thinnest foldables you can buy today, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> has noticeable upgrades. Having used both foldables for the better part of two weeks, I'll have to say that I enjoyed the Z Flip 7 better.</p><p>I usually prefer fold-out designs, but in this instance, I used the Z Flip 7 over the Fold 7. That's mostly down to the bigger cover panel; the increased real estate makes a noticeable difference in daily use, and the portability of the device is unmatched. Unlike last year, the cover panel now extends to the entire width of the device when folded, putting the device in contention with Motorola's foldables.</p><p>The outer panel finally gets 120Hz refresh as well, and it's just better to use than last year. The 4.1-inch OLED panel has good colors and vibrancy, and the bigger panel makes it easier to get back to notifications and messages without having to unfold the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-9" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Annoyingly, Samsung doesn't allow you to use apps on the outer panel, but this is easily addressed by using CoverScreen OS. This is where Motorola's phones have an inherent advantage, and Samsung should consider changing its stance to make it easier to use the increased panel size on the outside.</p><p>While the overall brightness still isn't as high as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I didn't see any issues in regular use — even under harsh sunlight. The design itself is thinner than last year, and that is another point in Samsung's favor this year; the brand did a good job delivering sleeker foldables. Another positive is that the device gets 256GB of storage with the base model, with Samsung finally eschewing 128GB.</p><p>And even though the Z Flip 7 uses the Exynos 2500 globally, I didn't run into any lag or slowdowns. Foldables generally don't have extensive thermal management, and the result is that they tend to throttle sooner than regular phones. That is the case with the Z Flip 7 as well, but it is in line with other flip phones I used recently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fZ3cjfSZAmGvv7bo5VXAf8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fZ3cjfSZAmGvv7bo5VXAf8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only point of contention on the Z Flip 7 is the battery; while the 4,300mAh battery is bigger than last year, it still isn't as big as what other manufacturers offer on their own devices. Samsung is clearly not willing to put massive batteries on its foldables, and that's something it will eventually need to address if it wants to measure up to its Chinese rivals.</p><p>Having said that, the Z Flip 7 manages to last a day with medium use. I had to plug it in on days with heavy use involving navigation and gaming, but on the whole, battery life is better than last year. Samsung is heavily positioning Galaxy AI as a differentiator, and the Z Flip 7 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.</p><p>The software is immediately familiar, but it has enough new features to excite long-term users. While I don't use AI features as such, it's undeniable that Galaxy AI has a robust suite of utilities geared at image generation and editing along with text-based assistance.</p><p>On the whole, the Z Flip 7 is a definite move forward, and Samsung addressed long-standing issues with its flip phones with the device. It's better to hold and use, is faster than last year, and the cameras are quite decent — honestly, I didn't think it would be as enjoyable to use.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bff15981-3597-4457-93da-58bd639c78b7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Thanks to a bigger cover panel and better internals, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is fantastic to use. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

This update, which is headed for mobile, will have a "Create New" option at the top right of the app with Remix available. Users can try the feature out, selecting one of the following styles: 3D animation, Anime, Sketch, or Comic Book.</p><p>Remix will then have users choose a photo they'd like to embody one of these styles before tapping "generate."</p><p>If you're unhappy with how the photo turned out, the post states you can "regenerate" the photo in a different style. Additionally, you could likely just backtrack, select a different photo, and repeat the process either with the same style or a totally new style. If you're still encountering difficulties, Google states photos that are well-lit, in focus, and with only a handful of subjects facing the camera yield the best results. Too many people in an image will mess up the Remix.</p><p>Once you're happy, the Photos app will let you save and share your images.</p><h2 id="remixing-your-memories-2">Remixing your memories</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:630px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:95.24%;"><img id="MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D" name="google-photos-remix-styles-selection" alt="Google Photos' Remix lets users decide which unique style they'd like AI to turn their photos into, like comic or sketch styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MK2CAAr2YytMVN4YUcRW4D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="630" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:534px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:112.36%;"><img id="nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D" name="google-photos-remix-wedding-example" alt="Google Photos introduces "Remix," a way to reimagine your photos in unique styles like animation, comic, sketch, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nsEDhSqyS5iWoPkzSeaF2D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="534" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>On one hand, this explainer could serve as fuel for the hype around Remix in Google Photos, as 9to5 notes, the feature's not widely available yet.

Just like what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">Google added in the Gemini app</a>, the Photos app was said to let users turn their still, static images into short six-second video clips.</p><p>Users can choose to have the person or people in the photo make small hand gestures/movements or have them do something wacky, like throw confetti into the air. Perhaps with Google detailing the Remix update this week, we're closer to a wider rollout for the feature than we realize.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google states this feature will "give you a personalized experience when it learns from your past chats." This is essentially a memory-based feature that enables Gemini to remember certain things about you, like your likes, dislikes, and preferences for certain aspects of your life.</p><p>Google offers some examples, stating users who've previously asked Gemini to summarize some popular non-fiction books on BookTok will likely receive book suggestions based on those previously summarized genres.</p><p>Additionally, if you've previously discussed comic books with Gemini and you're looking for birthday party ideas later on, the AI might pull from that older conversation about Batman or Green Arrow to help you with decorations.</p><p>While users retain the choice to have "personal context" on or off, Google states you can delete any past chats via Gemini App Activity. This feature is rolling out today (Aug 13), bringing personalized chats to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model first in "select" countries.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN" name="google-gemini-personal-context-example" alt="Google's Gemini app picks up "personal context," a feature that lets the AI automatically pull important details about a person from past chats to use for future queries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from personalization, Google states its second Gemini update focuses on user privacy and for those who don't want the AI to callback to certain questions. Temporary Chats is a new feature users can call on for "one-off" questions they may have for the AI. Google says things you ask about won't be remembered by Gemini, and they won't appear in the "recent chats" list in the sidebar.</p><p>Google also states things discussed in Temporary Chats won't be used to train its AI model, either. This feature is rolling out today (Aug 13) and will continue to reach more users "over the coming weeks."</p><p>The post then highlights a new setting to help users better control their data with the AI model. Soon, the app's "Gemini Apps Activity" setting will be renamed to "Keep Activity." If enabled, Google gives the following statement: "A sample of your future uploads will be used to help improve Google services for everyone."

It's a step up over the Watch 2 where it matters, and pandered to me with some fun running software tools.</p><p>However, Google's iffy software strategy and some strong rivals eventually killed my Pixel Watch 3 honeymoon period. Fortunately, Gemini has made things exciting again.</p><h2 id="doing-its-best-with-older-tech-2">Doing its best with older tech</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't know if the Pixel Watch 4 will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">stick with last year's processor</a> or use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon processor</a>.

Now that Gemini is a signature feature, every pixel of space for text is useful.</p><p>Even better, it has extra battery capacity, easily outperforming Google's 24-hour-with-AOD estimate. During my initial review period, I was hitting two days with sleep tracking and the occasional GPS workout. These days, it's closer to 36 hours, with hours to spare, since I rarely use it for sleep tracking.</p><p>Of course, I would like better battery life. Since the 3-to-5-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> launched, it's harder to accept how Google and Samsung can't seem to break past the 1-to-2-day barrier.

It didn't look <em>bad</em> to them like my bulky fitness watches, but the edgeless design doesn't appeal to everyone.</p><p>If the Pixel Watch 4 gets bulkier to fit in a bigger battery, as some rumors claim, that'll only exacerbate this design quirk.</p><p>Of course, plenty of people don't like the new look of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> <em>or</em> the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a>, either.

Vats spotted build numbers for the S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra in the region, marking the start of their beta program. Samsung's official changelog appearing on devices states U.K. users will find a ~3GB download size for One UI 8.</p><p>Moreover, the changelog informs users that only the unlocked version of the S24 models is eligible for this test. The August 1 security patch is also rolling in for users who're signing up for the beta program in the U.K.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1955549558282375210">separate X post states</a> the One UI 8 beta is starting in South Korea for the Galaxy S24 series, as well as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Fold 6. While the program's appearance in these two countries indicates its slow rollout around the world, some users are reporting a curious occurrence in India. Some users seeking out the beta program in India report a banner that says "recruitment closed." It's left many users on X bewildered as to what's going on.</p><p>Perhaps this will be rectified as the week winds down.

Google seems to have cancelled it for some unknown reason. But what's more fascinating is Google's first-party unreleased Pen is now being sold on several online sites, including Amazon.</p><p>While Google isn't selling these on its website, the accessory seems to have made it to the hands of some eager buyers. The pen looks like the real deal and not some kind of knock-off, as it shows up in one of the listings in the official Google-branded packaging, with "Pixel Tablet Pen" printed on the box.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nt3ThKdFVY4suQ4trFNCHL" name="Pixel Tablet Pen" alt="Unreleased Pixel Tablet pen shows up in an online listing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nt3ThKdFVY4suQ4trFNCHL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Goofish listing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first listing for the Pixel Tablet Pen began appearing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goofish.com/item?spm=a21ybx.search.searchFeedList.1.6ddb1cc5VqXckW&id=940478079816&categoryId=126854207" target="_blank">Chinese marketplace Goofish</a>, and later, the listings started cropping up on<em> </em>Amazon through different sellers sold under a generic "GM0KF for Pixel Tablet Stylus Pen Compatible with Google Pixel Tablet Pen" heading. Upon closer examination of the images in the Goofish listing, these accessories carry the GM0KF model number,  a “Designed for Google” badge, and Google’s logo on the button at the top of the stylus. The listing on Goofish shows the Pixel Tablet Pen in two colors, grey and white, and supports the USI 2.0 standard.</p><p>Folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/08/google-pixel-tablet-pen-gallery/">9to5 Google</a> purchased one of these pens and gave it a go, and it looks like the stylus worked flawlessly. "The stylus has a USB-C charging port with a status light, and charges up pretty quickly." When you bring the Pixel Table Pen close to the Pixel Tablet, it picks up on the accessory and starts functioning as it should.</p><p>"Input is responsive and fluid, the software responds when you hover over buttons, and there are no headaches anywhere," the publication added.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Tbu4EbpDW25Z5mxVyT5X6S" name="Pixel-Tablet-Pen" alt="Pixel Tablet Pen shows up online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Tbu4EbpDW25Z5mxVyT5X6S.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5 Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2NVaKyidkuuqwScnG4e5yQ" name="Pixel-Tablet-Pen" alt="Pixel Tablet Pen shows up online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NVaKyidkuuqwScnG4e5yQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5 Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The website notes that the special button at the top of the pen is merely to be fidgeted with and has no known functionality. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/googles-stylus-for-the-pixel-tablet-might-still-be-on-the-horizon">Early leaks showed</a> that clicking this button could pull up the note-taking app or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/find-my-device-is-out-googles-new-find-hub-is-officially-in">Find my Device</a>, but unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case with these pens.</p><p>Unreleased products might suddenly show up on sale in limited quantities; however, this is a first where a larger batch of Pixel Tablet Pens is being widely sold through Amazon.

According to multiple outlets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/perplexity-makes-34-5-billion-bid-for-google-s-chrome-browser">Bloomberg</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-startup-perplexity-makes-bold-345-billion-bid-googles-chrome-browser-2025-08-12/">Reuters</a>, Perplexity has made an "all-cash" offer of $34.5 billion to purchase Chrome.</p><p>This isn't the first time Perplexity has shown interest in buying Chrome. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/654835/perplexity-google-antitrust-trial-remedies-chrome">previously stated</a> it believes it could operate Chrome at the same scale as Google without charging users.</p><p>The Reuters report claims that Perplexity's term sheet for the deal says that it would keep the Chromium browser open-source, invest over $3 billion over two years, and make no changes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-default-search-engine-chrome">Chrome's default search engine</a> if the offer goes through.</p><p>Perplexity hasn't explained how it plans to fund the deal, given its own valuation is less than half the offer. However, reports say the company has unnamed backers willing to finance the purchase in full.</p><h2 id="perplexity-s-big-falls-far-below-chrome-s-estimated-value-2">Perplexity's big falls far below Chrome's estimated value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AYoyAck3KRRVr57NN7jRe4" name="Google-Pixel-7-boot-screen-Google-logo.jpg" alt="The Google logo on the Google Pixel 7's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYoyAck3KRRVr57NN7jRe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, Google doesn't appear interested in selling Chrome. However, the Mountain View giant is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">facing an antitrust case</a>, with the DOJ alleging in 2024 that Chrome illegally monopolized the search market. Federal judge Amit Mehta is expected to rule this month on possible remedies, which could include forcing Google to sell Chrome.</p><p>Even so, industry sources say Perplexity's offer is far below Chrome's estimated value of at least $50 billion. The situation is also puzzling given that Perplexity recently launched "Comet," an AI-powered browser built on the Chromium project.</p><p>Perplexity is already a familiar name in the AI space, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">companies like Samsung</a> and Motorola reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">exploring it as a default assistant</a> for their smartphones. Still, this bid suggests the startup's ambitions stretch far beyond that.</p><p>Google has yet to publicly comment on the offer but is expected to appeal any forced sale and, according to reports, is prepared to "fight for years" if necessary.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's social media post states the device went through its performance test using Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 SoC. The listing states the phone scored 3,393 in its single-core test and 11,515 in its multi-core test.</p><p>However, these numbers are suspected to be a bit higher once the device comes out, if this model at Geekbench is indeed the S26 Edge. The publication noticed that the phone was given the test with a 4GHz CPU, which is .74GHz under what was listed for the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. Chip data states it supposedly sports two cores at 4.74GHz and six cores at 3.63GHz.</p><p>Other, smaller specifications state the device was tested with its Android 16 OS and 12GB of RAM with the Adreno 840 GPU.</p><h2 id="an-edge-over-the-plus-2">An Edge over the Plus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-1" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's unclear is if we're seeing the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 "For Galaxy" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-true-snapdragon-8-elite-2-2nm-process-qualcomm-chip-rumor">that was rumored in June</a> or not. A South Korean publication alleged two months ago that Samsung was interested in creating a true For Galaxy Elite 2 for its S26 series based on a 2nm process. This would be special for the models as a 3nm node version would be made by TSMC for everyone else.</p><p>These rumors were reportedly still lingering as Samsung's head of foundry, Han Jin-man, was supposedly still awaiting a green light to move forward with these ambitions. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">had a 2nm process chip</a> in its headspace for a while now, so maybe this will happen.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that major rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">is kicking out its Plus model for the Edge</a>. This would mean consumers would see a Galaxy S26, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra next year. It's an interesting rumor, considering the Plus model, in 2024, saw a popularity boost, selling about 7.4 million units, a ~54% boost over its predecessor in 2023. Additional rumors allege the S26 Edge could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-thinner-larger-battery-galaxy-s26-edge-rumors">even thinner with new battery tech</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And yet, the Pixel 10 Pro XL might look like a completely different product than the Pixel 8 Pro. In only a few generations, Google pivoted its design language and delivered an enhanced feature set. That could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL look like a major upgrade compared to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>That doesn't necessarily mean every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> owner will want to trade in their trusty handset for a brand new one. It's up for debate whether the newer Pixel 10 Pro XL design is actually better — many Pixel fans like the old camera bar and pebble-shaped design. If you're on the fence, let's compare how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> might stack up against the Pixel 8 Pro in this speculative breakdown.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porcelain-01.jpg" alt="The matte glass on the back of the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If your last smartphone purchase was the Pixel 8 Pro, the rumored price tag of the Pixel 10 Pro XL might sting. Google is expected to cut the 128GB, entry-level variant of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, meaning the phone will start at 256GB and cost $1,199 as a result. You can upgrade to 512GB or 1TB configurations for an even higher cost. It's rumored to be available in Obsidian, Moonstone, Porcelain, and Jade colorways.</p><p>We'll likely see the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL for the first time at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Made by Google event</a> for Aug. 20, beginning at 1 p.m. ET.

Pre-orders could open as soon as that same day, with traditional retail availability starting Aug. 28.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 8 Pro launched on Oct. 12, 2023 at a retail price of $999.

The Pixel 8 Pro is the phone that would now be considered the "Pro XL" variant, so it's important to remember it is roughly the same size as the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro XL. While the Pixel 10 Pro XL isn't rumored to be a huge upgrade over the Pixel 9 Pro XL, two years of upgrades are compounding here compared to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL has the new boxy and rectangular design language, with flat side rails and a slight chamfer. There's also the pill-shaped camera bar on the back and simply fewer curves overall. By comparison, the Pixel 8 Pro has the older pebble-shaped design language with strong curves and an in-hand feel that some might prefer from a comfort standpoint. It also has the more traditional camera bar that extends from edge to edge.</p><p>You'll have to decide which design style you prefer, as there are major differences between the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 8 Pro. From an objective standpoint, the older Pixel 8 Pro is expected to be lighter, weighing 213 grams. Newer Pixel phones keep getting heavier, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL might weigh 232 grams this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmWknuwaArYGhwNhZ6FWzB" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-display-01.jpg" alt="The bright display on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmWknuwaArYGhwNhZ6FWzB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The form factor of the two phones will be mostly the same, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL being slightly thinner than the Pixel 8 Pro — the difference is 85mm vs. 8.8mm. This isn't exactly surprising, because the major design changes are carryovers from the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will have a larger and brighter display. It's expected to measure 6.8 inches, and the AMOLED panel will support at least 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The Pixel 8 Pro has a slightly smaller 6.7-inch AMOLED display topping out at 2,400 nits of peak brightness. Both phones have LTPO technology and can fluctuate between 1Hz and 120Hz refresh rates situationally.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of durability, both phones have IP68 protection against dust and water ingress, as well as Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will pack a bigger punch than the Pixel 8 Pro. It comes down to chipset and memory — the newer phone will feature a more advanced processor and 16GB of RAM. It should perform better than the Pixel 8 Pro as a result, which only has 12GB of memory and runs on the older Tensor G3 platform. Luckily, Google fixed overheating problems with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3, </a>but speeds are less than desirable in certain situations.</p><p>Google is reportedly swinging for the fences with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5 chip</a> in the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It's said to be the first Google chip to be fabricated using TSMC's 3nm process node, which is the same one used by Apple and Qualcomm. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">could also be more custom components in the Tensor G5 system-on-a-chip</a>, further improving the Pixel 10 Pro XL's efficiency and optimization.</p><p>Hopefully, this brings the Pixel 10 Pro XL more in line with Apple and Samsung phones in terms of raw power and gaming chops. These are areas where the Pixel 8 Pro is decidedly lacking compared to the competition.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 8 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 3000 nits (peak)</p></td><td  ><p>6.7-inch Super Actua display, 120Hz LTPO AMOLED (2992 x 1344), HDR10+, 2400 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5, Titan M2</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G3, Titan M2 security module</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB/512GB, 1TB (US)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>10.5MP f/2.2, 1.22um pixels, wide-angle</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.7 wide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.68, 1.2um pixels, PDAF, OIS, 4K at 60fps</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/1.95, 0.8um pixels, 125.5-degree wide-angle with autofocus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 5x periscope telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/2.8, 0.7um pixels, OIS, 5x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Magic Editor, Audio Magic Eraser</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,050mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>39W wired, 25W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>30W wired charging, 20W wireless charging, 5W reverse wireless charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth, NFC, USB-C 3.2, AptX HD</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Sub-6 5G (mmWave in US), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td><td  ><p>In-screen fingerprint module, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and rear glass)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.6 x 76.5 x 8.8mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td><td  ><p>213g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to keep the same camera hardware as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but that's still an upgrade over the Pixel 8 Pro in one area.

Otherwise, both phones should have a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, and a 48MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Rounding out the hardware improvements expected for the Pixel 10 Pro XL are battery and charging upgrades. The new model should have a 5,200mAh battery capacity with support for faster charging speeds.

At under $600, the Google Pixel 8 Pro is about half the price of a Pixel 10 Pro XL, which makes you think about whether the soon-to-be-released model is really twice as good. If I was in the market for a new Pixel, I'd at least <em>think</em> about whether a Pixel 8 Pro would meet my needs for a seriously-low price.</p><p>That said, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to pack a lineup of compelling upgrades over older models like the Pixel 8 Pro. The highlights include a fast, AI-centric Tensor G5 processor, Qi2 25W support with built-in magnets, and a bigger battery. If those hardware improvements sound exciting, it might be worth trying to get your hands on a Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>We'll learn more about the Pixel 10 Pro XL when it is officially announced later this month. Until then, everything we know about it is speculative, so we can't say for sure whether it'll be a slam-dunk upgrade over the Pixel 8 Pro or not.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6c952fc1-ff08-485e-ba4d-64b97b297657">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pixel perfect</strong></em></p><p>Aside from the weight, there's a lot to like about the rumored Pixel 10 Pro XL.

The company has a Made by Google event tabbed for Aug. 20, and that's when we'll get a first look at the Google Pixel 10 series and other new Pixel hardware. While we expect there to be a lot of similarities between the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 9 Pro XL, the new model is rumored to offer upgrades in a few major ways.</p><p>It's always tough — almost impossible — to justify annual upgrades for smartphones. They're just too expensive, even if the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> is said to be keeping its starting price point. However, the leaked upgrades for this year's flagship Pixel might tempt a few power users. Ahead of the Pixel 10 Pro XL's official launch, let's speculate on how the upcoming device might stack up against the existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H8kdYPHTPJqS77u5DZyJ8P" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-red-wallpaper" alt="A Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with an orange and red striped wallpaper on a tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H8kdYPHTPJqS77u5DZyJ8P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is expected to launch at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event</a> set for Aug. 20, starting at 1 p.m. ET. Google teased that we'll get the latest on "Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more," which is at least a partial nod to the unreleased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. We could see pre-orders open that same day, with widespread retail availability starting Aug. 28.</p><p>In a way, the Pixel 10 Pro XL could get a price hike — Google is reportedly axing the 128GB variant of the model. That would mean the Pixel 10 Pro XL will start at 256GB at a price point of $1,199. It's the same price as the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the removal of the entry-level model raises the price floor. Upgrades to 512GB and 1TB configurations will be available, and it's rumored to be sold in Obsidian, Moonstone, Porcelain, and Jade colorways.</p><p>Google launched the current Pixel 9 Pro XL on Aug. 22, 2024. The phone starts with 128GB of storage and retails for $1,099, with optional storage upgrades up to 1TB available. You can grab it in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white), Hazel (grey), and Rose Quartz (pink) colorways. As the phone gets older, it is more prone to discounts. We could see the Pixel 9 Pro XL priced more aggressively when the newer version releases.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the outside, we expect the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to look quite similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. You'll have the same general design language consistent across both phones, from the polished aluminum side rails to the pill-shaped camera bar. In fact, the dimensions of the Pixel 10 Pro XL are expected to be identical to those of its predecessor, measuring 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Early case samples suggest</a> that a tweak to the camera bar size might nix compatibility with older cases, though.</p><p>The weight could be a different story. The newer model is expected to weigh 232 grams, and that's hefty even for a phone of this size. For perspective, the Pixel 9 Pro XL weighs 221 grams and the Pixel 8 Pro weighs 213 grams. It's an unfortunate trend — Pixel flagships keep getting heavier, and this is a difference you'll feel in your hand and pocket.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sa9j5BACE8L2VkFyJpDj2b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-2025-02" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa9j5BACE8L2VkFyJpDj2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to have similar display specs as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

The Pixel 9 Pro XL's resolution is 2992 x 1344 pixels, and that might carry over to the 2025 model. For protection, we'll get Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and rear glass.</p><p>Rounding out the Pixel 10 Pro XL's durability suite is an IP68 certification, which is just about standard in 2025. It'll provide a solid amount of protection against dust and water ingress.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-03" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With so few design changes, colors will be a key differentiator.

This year, we expect to see the first Pixel to feature a Tensor G5 processor manufactured by TSMC. The Google Tensor G5 chip is said to be built using TSMC's advanced 3nm process node, leading to increased performance. The company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">reportedly also switching to more custom components for the G5</a>, potentially improving efficiency and optimization.</p><p>Google isn't expected to change the camera hardware found on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — the exact same setup should appear on the Pixel 10 Pro XL.

It's rumored to sport a 5,200mAh battery, up from the 5,060mAh capacity of the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be one reason why the Pixel 10 Pro XL is heavier. Another could be the inclusion of Qi2 magnets for quick connectivity with chargers and accessories.

There won't be new camera hardware or a design refresh this year, although that isn't exactly surprising. Instead, the Tensor G5 chipset should bring considerable performance and optimization improvements. The rumored Qi2 magnetic support and 25W fast wireless charging capabilities might make a big difference in daily use.</p><p>At the same time, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will look and feel mostly the same as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. There's no better evidence of that than the devices' rumored dimensions — both are expected to measure exactly the same. Given that the Pixel 9 Pro XL is already running Android 16 and has six more years of updates, there's no reason to get rid of this flagship phone anytime soon.</p><p>As usual, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will seem a lot more appealing to people with older Pixels that have waited longer to upgrade. That said, some features — like Qi2 25W — are sure to make Pixel 9 Pro XL users jealous.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="57cfb4d6-2853-4081-bf9d-76240090b9ae">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future Pixel</strong></em></p><p>With the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Google will further lean into the identity of Pixel phone.

That's because while it's not impossible to fool, it is extremely tricky.</p><p>Per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://insights.samsung.com/2019/10/21/ultrasonic-unlock-the-innovation-behind-samsungs-in-display-fingerprint-id/">Samsung</a>, an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor "counteracts spoofing attempts using 2D replicas of a person’s fingerprint," by creating a 3D map of the fingerprint and its ridges. Samsung also uses machine learning to determine when someone is trying to use a 2D image to fake a fingerprint.</p><p>To fool this type of fingerprint sensor, you would basically have to 3D print a copy of a fingerprint. And while 3D printers are more common these days, they're not exactly omnipresent, and the process of lifting a fingerprint and creating a copy would be a challenge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="99ohBLMNVw2MAuAeVe53G" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-back-with-samsung-case" alt="Looking closely at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99ohBLMNVw2MAuAeVe53G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, face unlock on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is not as secure and is generally an option that can be fooled more easily without dedicated hardware. That's because it solely relies on a 2D image of your face to unlock, as opposed to a 3D scan, similar to the iPhone's TrueDepth Face ID system or even the ToF sensor on the 2019 LG G8 (or Galaxy S10 5G).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a> facial biometrics, while seemingly safer and more reliable than previous generations, don't appear to have significantly improved on the security front. When setting up face unlock, Samsung warns that the feature is less secure "because there is some possibility that someone who looks like you or who uses an image of your face could unlock your phone." This means it can't be used for security measures beyond unlocking your phone, such as mobile payments.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel phones since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> meet Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">Class 3 biometrics standard</a>, thanks to their use of AI in tandem with camera data to enhance the accuracy of the camera. This means it can't be as easily fooled and has been determined secure enough for more sensitive security features.</p><p>So, the fingerprint sensor is your best security measure if you want to keep your Galaxy S25 secure, as it's not easily fooled. And with either option, Samsung still requires a secondary measure, such as a pin, passcode, or pattern.</p> ]]></dc:content>
