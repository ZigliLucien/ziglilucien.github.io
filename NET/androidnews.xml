The leak didn't give away much of its specs; however, it seems Samsung applied for the grant on 2 January this year, in India.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking‼️Galaxy S26 Edge (most likely) Spotted on BIS 🔥💡 Model: SM-S947B/DSEarlier, S26+ battery appeared with S946* on BIS.

However, according to more recent reports, the company could be sticking to its regular lineup of the base mode, the Plus, and the Ultra variant, leaving the Edge as an independent launch, much like the Galaxy S25 Edge, separate from the lineup altogether.</p><p>Ardent leaker Ice Universe also commented on the possibility of Samsung indeed launching the Galaxy S26 Edge, stating that "it is a product that is nearly complete and hastily canceling it would be a significant loss."</p><p>The main lineup is anticipated to launch in February this year, which is a slight delay from the typical end of January release.

For reference, the Galaxy S25 Edge's internal codename was "Slim," and "More Slim" could only mean that the company might be planning to shrink the size of the phone even further.</p><p>However, Samsung loves to throw us some last-minute surprises. While we may not see a line-up reshuffle this year, the launch event might give us a glimpse of the new Edge, considering they showed off the Galaxy S25 Edge multiple times before its official launch.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What is the rumored design of the Galaxy S26 Edge?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>According to leaked renders and "dummy units," the S26 Edge is designed to be a "slim flagship."

The Edge is driven by the same Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the rest of the S25 lineup (including the premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>), plus you get 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage in a frame that measures just 5.8mm thick. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> also boasts a flagship-quality 200MP main camera, a spacious 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and seven years of guaranteed OS and security upgrades. And again, the phone is ridiculously light, clocking in at just 163 grams. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-colors-13" alt="The Galaxy S25 Edge in all three colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJeix94B2bnfCyB6zZnmXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So what's the problem? Well, Samsung had to sacrifice battery size to make the Edge as thin as possible, so while most folks won't notice the difference with day-to-day use, the limitations of a 3,900mAh battery might have rubbed shoppers the wrong way. The Edge is also limited to 25W wired charging, which falls well behind the 45W charging support offered by the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra. </p><p>Samsung also fell into its own trap by releasing <em>quite a few</em> thin devices in 2025. It seems like most folks were happy to tack on another couple of millimeters if it meant that they could have a few more hours of battery life. Last but not least, with a starting price of over $1,000 for the 256GB phone, the Galaxy S25 Edge had a bit of a price problem. </p><p>Fortunately, bad news for Samsung spells good news for you, as the Galaxy S25 Edge has been repeatedly discounted for months at sites like Amazon and Best Buy. The phone is sure to get even cheaper when the spring sales roll around, but if you want an ultra-sleek smartphone today, this Amazon deal presents an awesome opportunity. </p> ]]></dc:content>

After launching the Pebble 2 Duo last year and announcing the Time 2 for this March, Repebble founder Eric Migicovsky announced the Pebble Round 2 this week, with plans to show off the watch at CES 2026.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/blog/pebble-round-2-the-most-stylish-pebble-ever">announcement post</a> and reveal video below provide details about this new device, which they began designing in March 2025 and will launch in May 2026, two months after the Time 2.</p><p>The Round 2 ditches the 2015 Round Time's <em>massive</em> bezel for a 1.3-inch, 260 x 260, 64-color e-paper touch display that's "optically bonded" to the glass for an increased viewing angle. It's about the same DPI as the 1.5-inch, square-shaped Pebble Time 2, though that uses fewer pixels (200x228).</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NaDPMZKXcBU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Migicovsky says they could make the Pebble Round 2 "so easily with such a small team" because it uses the "same electrical circuit design as Pebble Time 2," while the hardware is "basically the same" as the 2015 Time Round.</p><p>Essentially, Repebble is recreating the classic experience with a few new perks, such as 10–14 days of battery life instead of just 2–3. The new model measures 8.1mm, slightly thicker than the 7.5mm Time Round — or about on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Garmin Venu X1</a> (7.9mm) — making it <em>much</em> skinnier than your typical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5wnroXjWgJbYBrm2awRbqD" name="Pebble-Round-2-press-photo-4" alt="Photo of the Pebble Round 2 worn on a wrist surrounded by bracelets." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wnroXjWgJbYBrm2awRbqD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="QMMnsc3YPUdGjy3UHTfT7D" name="Pebble-Round-2-colors" alt="Render of four Pebble Round 2 models, showing the three color options: matte black, brushed silver and polished rose gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QMMnsc3YPUdGjy3UHTfT7D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2860" height="1609" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="jXbwZHMfL5sLGrNLW8nBmD" name="Pebble-Round-2-press-photo-2" alt="Photo of the Pebble Round 2 sitting on a marble counter surrounded by props." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jXbwZHMfL5sLGrNLW8nBmD.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One simple way Pebble pulled this skinny frame off is by removing certain common smartwatch features available in the Time 2: A HR sensor and a speaker for reading out notifications or AI replies. Pebbles aren't designed for workouts or Bluetooth calling, but the Time 2 can support a few extra features that the Round 2 can't.</p><p>Otherwise, both smartwatches use the same open-source Pebble OS, which works with both Android and iOS. This includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.repebble.com/en_US/watchapps">Pebble Appstore,</a> where developers have already made apps for sleep tracking, music, weather, games, messaging, and other tools.</p><p>The Pebble Round 2 will sport 3ATM water resistance, a vibrating motor, a 3-axis accelerometer for step tracking, a magnetometer (compass), dual mics, and four buttons. It won't have GPS tracking or NFC payments.</p><p>The Pebble Round 2 can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/watch">preordered now</a> for $199, and anyone who preordered a Time 2 can switch to the Round 2 if they prefer its design — and don't mind downgrading from 30 days of battery life to 14. The Round 2 comes in matte black, brushed silver, and polished rose gold, and ships with a silicone band and charging dongle.</p><h2 id="what-comes-next-2">What comes next</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="iovjuG3RbBT5e476pNZcbD" name="Pebble-Round-2-press-photo-1" alt="Photo of the Pebble Round 2 smartwatch and Index 1 smart ring worn outside with snow visible." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iovjuG3RbBT5e476pNZcbD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Pebble Round 2 and Index 1 smart ring </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year, Migicovsky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ericmigi/status/2003811563321663765">posted on X</a> that he was returning from Hong Kong "carrying 6 devices that I've made in the last year, including EVT samples of 3 new products that we haven't announced yet."</p><p>The three confirmed devices at the time were the sold-out Pebble 2 Duo watch, the Time 2, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://repebble.com/index">Index 1 smart ring</a> announced in December 2025, designed with a built-in mic for on-the-go voice memos.

It could also remind you to call your family if you haven’t reached out in a while.</p><p>This idea came up after a user shared a screenshot on X, which was reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-8-5-contact-family-member-3629370/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.

In the past, One UI updates focused on usability, customization, and design. Now, the change feels more emotional than technical.</p><p>Samsung hasn’t said exactly how the software decides who is “family,” but it probably uses contact data, call history, or Samsung’s family group features.</p><p>Importantly, this isn’t a forced action. You can dismiss the reminder and move on, which shows Samsung is trying to balance being helpful with not being too intrusive.</p><p>The family-call reminder is just one feature in a bigger update. One UI 8.5 looks like a major release, especially for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> users testing the beta version.</p><p>Since this is still beta software, not every feature is certain to be in the final release. But if Samsung keeps this one, One UI 8.5 might be known for encouraging users to reconnect.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze's MM-500</a> daily, and I think it is the ideal planar headset if you want fantastic sound quality. But what if you're a gamer? That's where the Maxwell comes into the equation; the headset also has a planar driver, but it has a few additional features that make it a better choice as a gaming headset.</p><p>And now, Audeze is launching the Maxwell 2, bringing better audio quality, flexible connectivity, and a few tweaks to the design that make it comfortable to wear. I've used the headset for a few days now, but I'm not ready to do a full review just yet (that's coming next week), but the broad strokes is that the Maxwell 2 does all the same things as its predecessor, while integrating a few oft-requested features, including tighter bass, Bluetooth 5.3 LE connectivity, much better mic, and AuraCast integration.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8148px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MiCVqK3i38cPR4gLorvr6J" name="Audeze Maxwell 2" alt="Audeze Maxwell 2 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MiCVqK3i38cPR4gLorvr6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8148" height="4583" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Audeze)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The result is a headset that absolutely shines. I like that Audeze focused on the gaming side of things with this release; while the Maxwell had great sound, it didn't quite hold up quite as well as its rivals when it came to the extras — that isn't an issue on the Maxwell 2. The headset has a ventilated headband that's just better, and the new detachable mic has double the bandwidth, physical controls, and AI-facilitated noise isolation.</p><p>The design itself is nearly identical, but Audeze is bringing additional customizability by enabling unique face plate designs — including 3D-printed choices. The headset is comfortable to wear, and it isn't as fatiguing as the brand's other products. I also like that there's Bluetooth 5.3 LE, and Audeze added LDAC codec, making the Maxwell 2 a great choice to use with Android phones.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fsuwkbPmivBk7zbcwqwxRG" name="Audeze Maxwell 2" alt="Audeze Maxwell 2 render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fsuwkbPmivBk7zbcwqwxRG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Audeze)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Audeze paid a lot of attention to the sound, and the Maxwell 2 is without any shadow of a doubt the best-sounding gaming headset you can buy. The planar drivers combined with the brand's unique tuning create a level of immersion that you just don't get on most other headsets, and it goes well beyond gaming — you can use the Maxwell 2 to listen to music, and as a regular Bluetooth headset with your phone.</p><p>It's this extensibility that I like the most about the headset. Battery life is pretty great too, and while I need to test the headset a little more to gauge real-world numbers, Audeze touts 80 hours between charges, with USB-C and fast charging available.</p><p>The Maxwell 2 is debuting at the same $329 price point as its predecessor, and the headset is now on sale at Audeze's site. While it is a lot of cash to shell out toward a headset, the planar driver and all the other features make it a great choice even if you're not a gamer.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update is not just a small fix — it’s a major 1.2GB release that addresses some of the most annoying issues early users faced in previous versions.</p><p>The new firmware, with a version number ending in ZZA3, is now available in the U.S., South Korea, Germany, and the UK (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/2008132935363469739" target="_blank">Tarun Vats</a>).

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series is the first to receive this update, surprisingly beating even Google’s own Pixel lineup to the punch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:355px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:245.07%;"><img id="mkpXWR3FxBcTBBwBYakF2o" name="One-UI-8.5-beta-3" alt="One UI 8.5 Beta 3 changelog" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkpXWR3FxBcTBBwBYakF2o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="355" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tarun Vats / X)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="battery-drain-and-gallery-lag-are-fixed-2">Battery drain and gallery lag are fixed</h2><p>This update mainly focuses on stability.

The update addresses high power use from certain apps, so your battery should last longer throughout the day.</p><p>The visual glitches that were making the UI feel unfinished have also been tackled. If you noticed the clock display error that was messing up your lock screen aesthetics, you will be happy to know that it has been patched.</p><p>The Now Briefing feature, which wasn’t showing up for some users, is working again.

Chargers that support Qi2 will work with magnetic phones including the Pixel 10 and wireless earbuds, and an even greater set of Android phones with a compatible case. Smartwatch charging, however, proved to be more elusive. Accessories offering 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 wireless charging often only supported the Apple Watch.</p><p>Belkin is trying to change that with the UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock, a Qi2 charging accessory announced this week at CES 2026. It will be available for a fairly-cheap $64.99 retail price, and has one neat feature: support for multiple smartwatch charging pucks. Typically, charging stands that require you to bring your own charging puck do so to cut costs, but that's only part of the story with this Belkin charger.</p><p>The modularity here allows Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and Google Pixel Watch users to insert their charger into the UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock for peak versatility. It'll work with all Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch models. Only the first- and second-generation Pixel Watches are supported, but that's because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-qi-wireless-charging">Google switched to pin-based charging systems</a> starting with the Pixel Watch 3.</p><p>The setup includes a pop-out tray for your smartwatch charging puck, complete with a variety of inserts and spacers to match your smartwatch brand and/or model. The cable is hidden, running through the stand's body into its base, where you'll find a USB-C input and output. The input is used to power the stand, and connects to the included 45W power adapter. The output, meanwhile, is for your smartwatch charger.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.82%;"><img id="8kDgi6S3WHq444Trz2pyiK" name="belkin_dock2.jpg" alt="The Belkin 3-in-1 modular charging dock shown off at CES." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8kDgi6S3WHq444Trz2pyiK.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="847" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Belkin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The smartwatch modularity is the selling point here, but the rest of the charger is impressive, too. The main charging pad <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">supports Qi2.2 technology,</a> meaning you'll get 25W charging speeds with supported devices. This magnetic charger is adjustable, helping you find the right viewing angle or fold it flat for travel and storage.</p><p>Underneath the phone charger is a smaller, fixed charging pad intended for use with wireless earbuds. So, you can use the UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock for a complete Samsung or Google mobile ecosystem, including a phone, earbuds, and smartwatch.</p><p>Belkin says it's expecting a launch this quarter for the UltraCharge Modular Charging Dock "in select markets," and it might just me the Wear OS charging solution you needed.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone is also said to support 90W wired charging with the included charger and 50W wireless charging.</p><p>The Signature is tipped to use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5, not the Elite version found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">latest and greatest Android phones</a> like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. Does that matter? For most people, it really doesn’t. It’s similar to the Pixel approach, where the chip easily handles daily tasks, AI features, and gaming, even if it doesn’t lead in benchmark tests. With up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, this phone should run smoothly.</p><h2 id="seven-years-of-updates-changes-everything-2">Seven years of updates changes everything</h2><p>In the past, buying a Motorola meant you’d be stuck with an old Android version after two years. That's about to change, as the Signature apparently comes with Android 16 and promises seven years of OS and security updates. This puts Motorola on the same level as the Pixel and Galaxy S series for long-term support.</p><p>It also appears that Motorola hasn’t cut corners on the cameras either. Instead of a basic 2MP macro sensor, the rear setup supposedly has three 50MP cameras. The main one is a Sony LYTIA 828 sensor with an f/1.6 aperture. There’s also an ultrawide lens that works as a macro lens, and a Sony LYTIA 600 telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. For selfies, you may get a 50MP front camera.</p><p>There were rumors about a built-in stylus, but the new leak doesn’t mention it, so it’s best not to expect one. The only detail left is the price. If Motorola can offer this phone for less than the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra, it could become the surprise hit of 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Xreal is changing that with the Xreal 1S, a new version that improves nearly every key feature and costs less than before.</p><p>The Xreal 1S succeeds the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a>, which came out in late 2024, and sets a new standard for entry-level spatial computing.</p><p>If you waited instead of buying the first generation, your patience has paid off. The new model offers 1200p Full HD resolution, up from 1080p, and a wider 52-degree field of view. This means the large virtual screen, which can reach the size of a 500-inch display, fills more of your view with less empty space around the edges.</p><p>The improvements go beyond just resolution. Xreal increased the peak brightness to 700 nits, so the glasses work better in daylight compared to the previous model's 600 nits. Gamers will be glad to see the 120Hz refresh rate is still here for smooth motion. The best part is the price: the 1S costs $449, which is $50 less than the last model's $499 launch price. You can buy the Xreal 1S now on Amazon or from Xreal's website.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SqpRY2bKTDDrUVPFdyxccS" name="Xreal-1S-front" alt="Xreal 1S in blue" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SqpRY2bKTDDrUVPFdyxccS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="3840" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="instant-3d-upscaling-2">Instant 3D upscaling</h2><p>Under the hood, the 1S runs on the Xreal X1 spatial computing chip, which handles much of the heavy lifting to keep latency at a barely-there 3ms. For context, Xreal claims Apple’s Vision Pro sits around 12ms, making the 1S theoretically snappier for head tracking.</p><p>This chip also enables a new feature called Real 3D. Instead of searching for apps or files that support 3D, the X1 chip can instantly turn regular 2D content — like YouTube videos, movies, or games — into 3D. You don’t need to set anything up or install extra software; just turn on the feature, and the glasses do the rest.</p><p>Of course, powerful glasses are useless if your handheld dies in an hour. That’s where the new Xreal Neo comes in. It is a dedicated power hub with a 10,000 mAh battery and video pass-through, which helps avoid the usual tangle of dongles in AR setups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FpU5gtzCUHLpAyGadk5gji" name="Xreal-Neo" alt="Xreal Neo hub" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpU5gtzCUHLpAyGadk5gji.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3375" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Xreal)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is great news for portable gamers. The Neo allows you to connect a Nintendo Switch or the upcoming Switch 2 and stream games directly to the glasses at 1080p and 120Hz, going beyond the Switch’s usual 720p limit. Steam Deck users benefit even more, as the glasses support the full 1200p resolution.</p><p>Keep in mind that the 1S is available now, but the Neo will not ship until February 2026. Early buyers can get the Neo for $99 until February 4, after which the price will increase to $119.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It should understand your day, your space, and your mood, then adjust itself to match. This idea is central to Govee’s “Lighting the Future” campaign, which features three new flagship products and a bigger focus on adaptive, AI-powered lighting.</p><p>The main change isn’t just new hardware; it’s how that hardware works. Govee is introducing three key technologies in its 2026 lineup: LuminBlend+, AI Lighting Bot 2.0, and DaySync. These are designed to make lighting feel like a natural part of your home’s daily routine.</p><p>LuminBlend+ is the main technology behind these changes. It upgrades Govee’s color system with a 16-bit precision chip, proprietary gamma calibration, and RGB-to-white blending. This means you get control over 281 trillion colors and a wide color temperature range from 1000K to 10000K. In simple terms, you can have warmer light in the morning or brighter light for tasks without the usual washed-out effect from big color changes.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4348px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.02%;"><img id="WTx8jcKdGkxtc5ecWvqukK" name="Govee-Ceiling-Light-Ultra" alt="Govee Ceiling Light Ultra on a ceiling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WTx8jcKdGkxtc5ecWvqukK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4348" height="3262" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Govee Ceiling Light Ultra </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Govee)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KosibP8iR5Z8wQafHfV73L" name="Govee-Ceiling-Light-Ultra" alt="Govee Ceiling Light Ultra on a ceiling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KosibP8iR5Z8wQafHfV73L.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Govee Ceiling Light Ultra </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Govee)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>AI Lighting Bot 2.0 takes things further. For linear lights, it now lets you adjust scenes through natural conversations instead of fixed commands. For pixel and graphic lights, it can quickly create animated visuals from simple descriptions.</p><p>DaySync is another key feature. It automatically changes brightness and color temperature based on the time of day, sunrise and sunset, and local conditions. Govee plans to launch this in April 2026 on new indoor products, so you won’t have to constantly adjust schedules and scenes yourself.</p><h2 id="three-products-that-show-the-shift-2">Three products that show the shift</h2><p>All of these technologies appear in three new flagship products. The Govee Floor Lamp 3 is the most advanced. It combines LuminBlend+, DaySync, and AI Lighting Bot 2.0 in a double-sided skyline design that looks good from every angle.</p><p>With this lamp, you get very precise color control, the widest white-light range in its class, and lighting that changes throughout the day without you having to adjust it. Pricing and release dates haven’t been shared yet, but it’s clear this is for people who see lighting as part of their room’s design, not just an extra feature.</p><p>The Govee Ceiling Light Ultra is designed to be more playful. It uses a 616-pixel LED matrix, so your ceiling becomes a creative canvas. With AI visuals, custom effects, and 5000 lumens of brightness, it works well in both family areas and rooms where you want to make a statement. It also has a CRI of 95 and a white range from 2700K to 6500K, so it’s practical as well as stylish.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nQBsfvFo3Yjhfdkhyt4Zb4" name="Govee-smart-lights" alt="Govee Floor Lamp 3 beside a TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nQBsfvFo3Yjhfdkhyt4Zb4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Govee)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mBxXVPEj7mBP8z9xaXkFN4" name="Govee-smart-lights" alt="Govee Sky Ceiling Light on a ceiling" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mBxXVPEj7mBP8z9xaXkFN4.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Govee)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Govee Sky Ceiling Light focuses on comfort and well-being. It uses custom LEDs and a skylight-style gradient to create realistic blue-sky colors and sunset effects, which is especially helpful in rooms without windows. It offers up to 5200 lumens, keeps a CRI of 95, and uses DaySync to copy natural circadian lighting automatically.</p><p>Govee is also growing its smart home features. In 2026, support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsungs-new-smartthings-hub-hits-us-shelves-and-its-a-big-deal-for-your-smart-home">Samsung SmartThings</a> will start with some indoor and home-theater products, including all three new flagships.

This tricked the Samsung Tips app into showing a new feature called "Privacy Display."</p><h2 id="no-compromise-viewing-2">No compromise viewing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:368px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.30%;"><img id="cdmQApBmrhPa7Fr8pvsJ6d" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-privacy-display-feature" alt="Animation for the privacy display feature in the Galaxy S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cdmQApBmrhPa7Fr8pvsJ6d.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="368" height="796" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure><p>How does it work? Animations from the Tips app show that this feature is part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-official-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8.5</a>. When you turn it on, your screen looks normal if you’re looking straight at it. But for anyone trying to glance at your phone from the side, top, or bottom, the display obscures itself, essentially blacking out the content.</p><p>You get the security of a physical privacy filter without permanently ruining your display quality for the 99% of the time you’re not on a crowded subway.</p><p>From a technical point of view, this is interesting. Rumors say Samsung is using something called "Flex Magic Pixel" OLED technology along with AI to make it work.</p><p>This feature isn’t just a simple on or off switch. Leaks say you’ll find it in Settings under Display, and you can also add a toggle to your Quick Settings panel.</p><p>It gets better — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-shows-first-look-at-built-in-privacy-display">you can supposedly automate it</a>. Instead of turning it on every time you hop on a subway train, the code hints that you can set Privacy Display to turn on automatically based on your location or when you open certain apps. For example, your screen could switch to private mode when you open your banking app, then go back to normal when you leave.</p><p>If these leaks hold up for the late February launch, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is going to solve a problem most of us didn't realize could be fixed by the phone itself.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorolas-g-power-2026-mid-range-embraces-your-crazy-life-with-power-and-class">Moto G Power 2026</a> will launch on January 8th for $299.99, which is the same price as the 2025 model. Motorola is promising improved toughness, better battery life, crisper selfies, and plenty of classic Moto UX apps. Naturally, its biggest competitor would be the one that it's replacing, which is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">2025 Moto G Power</a>.</p><p>The latter was a solid mid-range offering when it launched, but it wasn't perfect. Now, with a $100 price cut, the Moto G Power 2025 has jumped in value, making it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheapest Android phones</a> to feature the highly coveted IP69 rating for dust and water resistance.</p><p>With the new model now here, comparing the Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025 is something you don't want to miss.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-moto-g-power-2025-design-and-display-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE" name="moto-g-power-2026-cashmere-color" alt="Motorola G Power 2026 in a Cashmere color beside an iced coffee on a cream-colored table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cw5q9qAyrM66rAU8Cxk3iE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 looks very similar to the 2025 model. There's a minor design tweak to the rear camera bump, but everything else, like the weight and dimensions, is seemingly identical. I wouldn't be surprised if the previous gen's cases would fit this new model too. The Moto G Power 2025 was extremely well built and looked great, and I imagine it would be the same for the 2026 model.</p><p>You get IP68 and IP69 certifications for water protection, which is the same as what the Moto G Power 2025 offered. Motorola claims the 2026 model has been tested against "16 categories and 14 MIL-STD-810H tests," so it's certified to withstand extreme temperatures, drops, and humidity.</p><p>The display's scratch protection has been bumped up to Corning Gorilla Glass 7i, from Gorilla Glass 5 on the older model. The 2026 Moto G Power comes in new shades called Pantone Pure Cashmere and Pantone Evening Blue. The display is the same 6.8-inch IPS LCD with a Full-HD+ resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-13" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down in snow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4120" height="2317" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 2025 Moto G Power set the toughness standard for a $300 smartphone in early 2025. The IP68/ IP69 rating, coupled with the MIL-STD-810H certification, makes it one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">best rugged phones</a> to own on a budget. The build quality was excellent, it came in two fun colors, and it simply felt like a solid phone when you held it.</p><p>The 2025 model had a solid display too, coming in at the same size as the 2026 Moto G Power. Maximum brightness level was only 1,000 nits, but sunlight legibility wasn't an issue when we tested it. On paper, the Moto G Power 2026 and 2025 editions are pretty much identical in terms of design, display, and build quality, so you're not really sacrificing anything going with the older model.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-moto-g-power-2025-hardware-specs-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think Motorola did the Moto G Power 2026 a bit of disservice by using the exact same SoC as the 2025 model. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 works decently well for regular tasks as well as a bit of gaming, but we did feel a bit of sluggishness at times when using the 2025 model. This could be down to the software optimizations made by Motorola (or lack thereof), so this could improve with Android 16.</p><p>The new Moto G Power only comes in a single variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Thankfully, Motorola continues to provide a microSD card slot for storage expansion. Kudos to Motorola for increasing the battery capacity but not the weight of the phone. You now get a 5,200mAh battery, which is said to provide "two days of power."</p><p>There's also 30W wired charging like before, but Motorola has removed wireless charging, probably to compensate for any weight increase. I'm sure there are some wireless charging fans out there that would be disappointed by this.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Moto G Power 2026</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Moto G Power 2025</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Hello UX)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (Hello UX)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Pure Cashmere, Pantone Evening Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Evening Blue, Pantone Pure Cashmere</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,388 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,388 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6300</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6300</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main with Quad Pixel technology, 8MP ultra-wide, macro vision lens, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main with Quad Pixel technology, 8MP ultra-wide, macro vision lens, 16MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Hi-Res Audio, Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Hi-Res Audio, Dolby Atmos)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>Yes (15W)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>166. 62 x 77.1 x 8.72 mm</p></td><td  ><p>166. 62 x 77.1 x 8.72 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>208 grams</p></td><td  ><p>208 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The 2025 Moto G Power has the exact same RAM and chipset as the 2026 model. General performance is good as long as you manage your expectations. Of course, don't expect to play graphically demanding games at the highest quality settings, but toning things down helps even heavy games run well. Battery life is also solid, as you can stretch usage up to two days if you're a bit frugal with your usage.</p><p>The fact that you get 15W wireless charging is a big feather in the 2025 Moto G Power's cap. It's a shame Motorola decided to remove it from the new version. It's certainly not the fastest wireless charging speed, but for a now $200 phone, it's really hard to complain.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-moto-g-power-2025-software-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 runs Android 16 out of the box and comes bundled with Motorola's signature apps. There's Moto Secure, Moto Unplugged, Family Space, ThinkShield, and more. There aren't really any homegrown AI features or apps, though, but you do get some of them from Google, like Circle to Search and Gemini. We hope Motorola has done away with some of the bloatware apps it bundled with the 2025 Moto G Power.</p><p>The 2025 Moto G Power was promised two OS upgrades and three years of security updates, and we assume the same holds true for the 2026 model as well. We would have liked a longer software upgrade commitment to be honest, as it falls severely behind Samsung's update promise for its recent A-series phones.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-moto-g-power-2025-cameras-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Selfie lovers should have better luck with the 2026 Moto G Power, as it now has twice the resolution as before. The 16MP shooter on the 2025 model was alright, but images were usually noisy and lacked detail. The 32MP sensor on the new model should hopefully fare better.</p><p>Sadly, the rest of the cameras seem to be exactly the same. There's a 50MP main sensor and an 8MP ultrawide camera. Motorola claims that users can use the RAW Night Vision Mode to take "crisper cityscapes or a dimly-lit night out." We'll know how much truth there is to these claims once we've had a go at it.</p><p>In my experience, I wouldn't expect a world of difference in image quality between the two models. At most, we could expect some tweaks to the software post-processing due to the newer version of Android, but these improvements should ideally also trickle down to the  2025 model once updated to Android 16.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-moto-g-power-2025-which-one-should-you-buy-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Moto G Power 2025: Which one should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6qWYY2qRYgPTSEPXV2AjeC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-01" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 on a snowy surface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qWYY2qRYgPTSEPXV2AjeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4068" height="2288" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For me, the choice is pretty easy. I'd save the $100 and grab the Moto G Power 2025 while I still can. You're not <em>really</em> losing out on anything major by going with this older model. In fact, you gain wireless charging, which has been dropped in the newer model. I don't see much of an incentive in picking the 2026 model for $100 more.</p><p>I think Motorola rushed the launch of the 2026 Moto G Power for reasons only it knows best. At $300, it still has many features that most phones don't, and for that alone, you could maybe consider it. But not while the 2025 model is still in circulation.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <a href="https://www.motorola.com/us/en/p/phones/moto-g/moto-g-power-2026/pmipmjb42mv" data-model-name="Moto G Power 2026" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>What were they thinking?</strong></em></p><p>I'm a little stumped at the 2026 Moto G Power, as it does not do enough to justify the $100 premium over the 2025 model.

The last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-finally-fights-notification-overload-and-lets-you-kill-ugly-icons">December 2025 feature drop</a> added new ways of tackling your notifications. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-and-customize-notification-summaries-on-your-pixel">Notification summaries</a> use AI to recap a long message or missed conversations in a group chat. We also got a new option called Notification organizer for automatically grouping and silencing low-priority notifications.</p><p>These features are currently only available on Google Pixel 9 and 10 series phones, and in limited regions, for now anyway. Once you've updated your Pixel phone, Notification organizer should be enabled by default. Here's how to access it and customize it if needed.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-android-ai-notification-organizer-on-a-pixel-2">How to use Android AI notification organizer on a Pixel</h2><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app by tapping the shortcut on your homescreen or swipe the notification shade downward twice to find the <strong>gear icon</strong> at the bottom right.</p><p>2.

Jump back to <strong>step no. 3</strong>, and here, you can uncheck certain groupings like notifications from social apps, news, etc.</p><p>7. Tapping the last menu item called <strong>Manage apps</strong> will let you select apps that you wish to exclude from Notification organizer.

The new Notfication organizer feature is a smarter way of doing the same thing.</p><p>The update began rolling out on December 2, 2025, in a phased manner, so if you haven't recieved this yet, be patient.

Now, Samsung's latest earbud portfolio includes the budget Galaxy Buds 3 FE, the midrange Galaxy Buds 3, and the flagship Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The cheapest earbuds start at $150, whereas the most expensive ones cost $250.</p><p>Surprisingly, the gap in the feature set between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-pack-ai-smarts-and-strong-anc">Galaxy Buds 3 FE</a> and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is quite small. You give up wireless charging, longer battery life, and head-tracked spatial audio when you choose the cheaper Galaxy Buds model, but keep stalwarts like ANC and hi-res audio. With frequent discounts, though, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a> may be worth spending a bit extra.</p><p>Here's how Samsung's cost-friendly "Fan Edition" earbuds compare to the brand's most premium model.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-vs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-design-and-fit-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE vs. Galaxy Buds 3 Pro: Design and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bmU7tTzLmRnAMA7aaUPNXZ" name="Galaxy-Buds-3-FE-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in official press images." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bmU7tTzLmRnAMA7aaUPNXZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The entire Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 series features a new design language that serves as a departure from prior Galaxy Buds models. In fact, the look and feel of both the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and Buds 3 Pro have been criticized for appearing too similar to AirPods Pro. Regardless, the new design, which sports stems that Samsung calls "blades," has a few practical benefits. These blades are used for swipe controls for volume and playback, and put the microphones closer to your mouth for better call quality.</p><p>Both pairs of earbuds use silicone ear tips and include multiple sizes for customization. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have colored marks on both earbuds that signify which one is the left and right bud, with corresponding indicators on the charging case. Additionally, the more premium model has lights on each "blade" that can pulse with your music.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ANFmNNxZNMoD5U9PpxDn5T" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-bud.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ANFmNNxZNMoD5U9PpxDn5T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE ditch the lighting effects, but for a pair of earbuds, that's a feature omission I bet no one will miss. It's a cool quirk of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, but is not exactly a selling point.</p><p>The charging case for both the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is revamped to accommodate the larger earbuds. Each one has a USB-C port for charging and a clear window on the lid, but only the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's case supports wireless charging.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-buds-3-fe-vs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-sound-quality-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE vs. Galaxy Buds 3 Pro: Sound quality and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZWYhNe8Er5J8EvpBoMr4aZ" name="Galaxy-Buds-3-FE-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in official press images." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZWYhNe8Er5J8EvpBoMr4aZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From a sound quality perspective, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE is miles ahead of previous FE earbuds, but lags a bit behind the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. That's because the cheaper variant uses a single-driver design with one 11mm dynamic driver. The older Galaxy Buds FE used a 6.5mm driver in each earbud, so the 11mm dynamic driver in the Galaxy Buds 3 FE is a major upgrade.</p><p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, in comparison, uses a dual-driver design with a 10.5mm dynamic driver and a 6.1mm planar tweeter. The combination of a dynamic driver and planar tweeter results in better range and overall sound quality. We've rated the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro as some of the best-sounding earbuds on the market, although they can be a bit bass-heavy.</p><p>Both the Galaxy Buds 3 FE and the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have active noise-canceling, ambient sound, and 360 Audio. However, only the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's spatial audio mode supports head tracking. The premium model also adds Voice Detect and Siren Detect, which lowers the volume of your music and decreases immersion when voices or sirens are heard nearby.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Categories</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.4, Auto Switch</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.4, Auto Switch</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>11mm Dynamic</p></td><td  ><p>10.5mm Dynamic + 6.1mm Planar</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Codec Support</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Seamless Codec (SSC), SSC UHQ (24bit/96kHz), AAC, SBC</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Seamless Codec (SSC), SSC UHQ (24bit/96kHz), AAC, SBC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Noise control</p></td><td  ><p>ANC, Ambient Sound</p></td><td  ><p>ANC, Ambient Sound, Voice Detect, Siren Detect</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery life</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 4 hours (ANC on) / 24 hours with case</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 6 hours (ANC on) / 26 hours with case</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, Wireless Qi</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>App support</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wear (Android Only)</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung Wear (Android Only)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Microphone</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics with Voice Pickup Unit (VPU)</p></td><td  ><p>3 mics with Voice Pickup Unit (VPU)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability</p></td><td  ><p>IP54</p></td><td  ><p>IP57</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Battery life is better on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, too, as they support six hours of playtime with ANC on for each earbud.

It removed things the average listener can live without, like a wireless charging case and the LED strips. On the flip side, Samsung kept active noise-canceling, adaptive mode, and 360 Audio on the Galaxy Buds 3 FE. While the Galaxy Buds 3 FE have a single-driver design, unlike the dual-driver Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, the driver is much larger than the one within the Galaxy Buds FE they're replacing.</p><p>At $150, or as low as $130 with regular discounts, the Galaxy Buds 3 FE are quite an easy sell. Buyers simply have to consider whether paying around $50 more for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is the better value. Retailing for $250 but frequently available for $180 or less, Samsung's flagship earbuds have a stellar value proposition of their own. For the extra money, you get a wireless charging case, longer battery life, better sound quality, and head tracking support.</p><p>Another factor to keep in mind is that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are due to be replaced by the Galaxy Buds 4 Pro soon, according to rumors and leaks. However, considering the low price of the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/the-samsung-galaxy-buds-4-pro-leaks-dont-impress-me">there might not be a reason to wait</a>.</p><p>Generally, if you're on the tightest of budgets or only need the basics, you can't go wrong with the Galaxy Buds 3 FE. For those who want the complete experience, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are also worth paying a bit more to own.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="eca74daf-f60a-469a-b835-3fae873bd765">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRzvqn7MtfKvH9hJFA7vBY.jpg' alt="The Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE in official press images."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The cheapest option</strong></em></p><p>Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 FE provide quality sound and ANC support at a sub-$150 price point.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> series was good overall, but many fans still wanted a camera that felt truly top-tier. The OnePlus 16 might finally deliver on that front.</p><p>According to prolific leaker Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QkNgxy20M" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, OnePlus could use a 200MP sensor for the OnePlus 16 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2025/12/oneplus-16-200mp-camera-upgrade-leak.html" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>). The rumor suggests this hardware will be shared with the upcoming OPPO Find N6 foldable. If you connect the dots with the current market trends, it looks like we could see a 200MP periscope telephoto lens.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 uses a decent but small 50MP sensor for zoom. It works, but it doesn’t gather as much light or offer the cropping flexibility of larger sensors. With a 200MP sensor, you could crop images much more without losing detail.</p><h2 id="sharing-dna-with-oppo-2">Sharing DNA with OPPO</h2><p>This move makes sense when you look at the family tree. OnePlus and OPPO (both under the BBK umbrella) frequently swap homework. The OnePlus 15 and the OPPO Find N5 already share the same main and telephoto sensors. With the OPPO Find N6 rumored to have a triple-camera setup with a 200MP sensor, it’s likely the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-16">OnePlus 16</a> will use similar hardware.</p><p>Keep in mind, these details are still early rumors. The OnePlus 16 will probably launch in late 2026, so prototypes are still being tested and plans could change.</p><p>If these leaks hold up, the OnePlus 16 could be the most well-rounded flagship the company has released in years. It looks like this phone may finally offer a camera that doesn’t require users to overlook any compromises.</p><p>For longtime fans, this could be the upgrade worth waiting for. And for anyone who skipped the OnePlus 15 because the camera didn’t quite deliver, the next model might finally check all the boxes.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Under normal conditions, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> shifts between its full, interactive watch face and a simplified AOD version smoothly when your wrist drops. On Wear OS 6, however, something in that handoff has gone sideways.</p><p>Owners report seeing a "ghosting" effect in which the active watch face and the AOD version overlap. Instead of a smooth fade from bright to dim, you get a frozen, transparent mess of overlapping numbers and hands.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:98.75%;"><img id="Nizb3QKwYBv7rpkVZpXxFk" name="Broken-watch-face-in-wear-os-6" alt="broken watch face on a Wear OS 6 smartwatch showing overlapping AOD layout and third-party watch face" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nizb3QKwYBv7rpkVZpXxFk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="316" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: PiunikaWeb)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t limited to one brand.

That’s important because it suggests this is a Wear OS 6 platform-level problem.</p><p>The root of the problem appears to be a change in how Wear OS 6 handles AOD rendering for third-party watch faces. Google introduced new APIs meant to improve efficiency and consistency, but those changes seem to have broken compatibility with existing watch face frameworks.</p><h2 id="stock-faces-still-work-fine-2">Stock faces still work fine</h2><p>The system gets stuck halfway, leaving a broken, half-finished screen. This bug mostly affects third-party watch faces. If you use the watch faces that came with your device, you probably have not seen this problem because those faces work differently.</p><p>Some users have temporarily fixed the issue by switching to an official Pixel or Samsung watch face, but that’s more of a workaround than a solution.</p><p>This is not the customization you expected, but it is better than looking at a messy screen every time you check your steps. Google and Samsung seem to be aware of the problem, but since it is a system issue, we have to wait for an update to fix it.</p><p>Until the update arrives, avoid third-party watch faces and watch for the next firmware update.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Now, its successor is here to defend the title. Samsung has introduced the Galaxy A17 5G and the Galaxy Tab A11 Plus, and while both offer strong value for the price, there’s one important change in the specs you should know about.</p><p>Unlike the previous model, which offered 6GB and 8GB options, the Galaxy A17 comes in just one version with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. For heavy users, 4GB may feel limiting in 2026.</p><p>But there is a big benefit that could make up for it.

It has a 6.7-inch FHD+ Super AMOLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The Exynos 1330 processor powers the phone, and it comes with a 5,000mAh battery that supports 25W fast charging.</p><p>The 50MP main camera now includes Optical Image Stabilization (OIS), a feature not often found in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget phones</a>.

It also includes a 3.5mm headphone jack, a feature many customers still value.</p><p>Unlike the phone, the tablet gives you breathing room in terms of specs. You can choose between a 6GB/128GB model and an 8GB/256GB model, both powered by a MediaTek MT8775 chipset.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It's not everyday that I get to use a $1,999 IEM, and Thieaudio clearly nailed the brief with the Valhalla. I'd say that it is aimed at enthusiasts, but there are plenty of other models that don't cost as much as the Valhalla that still deliver a great sound. Look, if you just want decent-quality IEMs that sound good and are comfortable to wear, there are dozens of great choices in the sub-$100 category.</p><p>But what if you want the best? The best design, the best sound quality, and the best drivers available today. This is where Thieaudio is differentiating itself; the brand has been on a roll in the last two years, and IEMs like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/thieaudio-monarch-mkiii-best-iem-ive-used-yet">Monarch MKIII</a> are a clear favorite thanks to the audio tuning and the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="4CFeWygsaxSRwMPMLQAwhd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4CFeWygsaxSRwMPMLQAwhd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And now there's the Valhalla. Coming in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/thieaudio-valhalla">at $1,999 on Linsoul Audio</a>, the IEMs are Thieaudio's costliest by a huge amount, and they're truly incredible. If nothing else, each earbud houses 19 balanced armature drivers, and that's bordering on overkill. We need to talk about the drivers, because it bears mentioning: each earbud houses four Sonion 38D1XJ007 subwoofer drivers to provide detailed bass, <em>ten </em>Sonion E50DT0005 low-midrange and mid-range drivers, four Knowles RDE 33729 treble drivers, and a Knowles WBFK 30095 tweeter that delivers treble extension that most IEMs don't come close to.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PsurWTLLLiaihC4a6geHkd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PsurWTLLLiaihC4a6geHkd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you'd imagine for a product of this caliber, there are lots of innovations. What's of particular interest is the Precision Bass System, Thieaudio's solution to delivering a "subwoofer-like" system in an IEM. It includes a unique resonance chamber which is optimized to produce a vibrant sub-bass; basically, the Valhalla has one of the best-sounding bass extension of any flagship IEM.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="rHSJzqw5gQbRyfrLeVwCmd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rHSJzqw5gQbRyfrLeVwCmd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It also uses custom tubing to deliver "smooth transitions" across the entire frequency range, and it's clear that Thieaudio obsessed over the minutiae when it comes to the Valhalla. That's immediately evident when you start using the IEMs; the design is striking to say the least, and it's unmistakable that these are high-end IEMs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="65uSDHdQYUisUftCHZjrid" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/65uSDHdQYUisUftCHZjrid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The shell of the Valhalla is made out of titanium, and it is durable; I've been using these IEMs for the better part of four months now, and they're pristine. I have no doubt that they're built to last, and while the shells are on the bigger side — no doubt to accommodate all the drivers — they don't exert too much pressure, and they're on the lighter side. While they don't look like it, the IEMs are comfortable to wear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="mDUYB7ERkiFbHwz5xLVjnd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mDUYB7ERkiFbHwz5xLVjnd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Where the IEMs truly stand out is the design of the faceplate; Thieaudio has a total of 15 designs available, and you can easily customize the shell to your liking. I got the standard model, and I like its design quite a bit; it has a vibrant etched pattern that grabs attention while not coming across as ostentatious.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cMpnhjGYvrMUFocja8Rfvd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMpnhjGYvrMUFocja8Rfvd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thieaudio's logo is highlighted at the bottom, and the overall design easily reinforces the premium nature of the IEMs. I also like the matte texture of the shells, as they don't get smudges anywhere as often. You get the usual mix of silicone and foam ear tips, and I would have liked to see a wider selection of options in this area. Other brands provided additional pairs in the box, but Thieaudio offers the same set as you get with the Monarch MKIII.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="6qLfpDsAdtF8iLABrn9Lwd" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6qLfpDsAdtF8iLABrn9Lwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, the bundled tips provide good isolation and a tight seal. The sound nozzle itself is pretty big and is angled, and the size of the IEMs means the Valhalla just out of your ears. That said, once you get a right fit, you won't even notice that you're wearing the IEMs, and the lighter design makes a big difference.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5090px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="GvgHP9cdJjzXG6aKXKNUod" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GvgHP9cdJjzXG6aKXKNUod.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5090" height="2867" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thieaudio did a great job with the bundled EliteNoir cable; the silver-plated cable has a braided design and is pretty flexible, and it has a modular system with 3.5mm and balanced 4.4mm plugs. It connects to the Valhalla via the standard 2-pin connector. Rounding out this section, you get a hard shell case with suede lining that holds the Valhalla, the cable, and all the accessories.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yKCbrLE5kmWoFTv59nAQud" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yKCbrLE5kmWoFTv59nAQud.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Obviously, the sound quality is incredible — that's a given when you consider the sheer amount of engineering that went into the Valhalla, and the number of drivers used. The IEMs have a wonderfully rich and detailed low-end, with excellent sub-bass vibrancy that makes a big difference. The bass in general is controlled well while still delivering a good rumble; most IEMs have weedy bass that doesn't have much in the way of energy, but that isn't the case with the Valhalla.</p><p>The mid-range is delightful, allowing vocals and instruments to shine. You'll hear every nuance (provided you're using a decent source) and note, and the Valhalla extends this to the treble, delivering good airiness and detail retrieval without any sense of harshness. Overall, the layering and dynamics are nothing short of top-notch. I tested the Valhalla with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-m23-review">Fiio M23,</a> and having a good source makes a difference.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qqkXCjD87EpaL4gWVaCc4e" name="Thieaudio Valhalla" alt="Thieaudio Valhalla IEM review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qqkXCjD87EpaL4gWVaCc4e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Having used the Valhalla for just over six months, there's no doubt in my mind that these are the best IEMs I've used. They may not be the most comfortable, but when it comes to the soundstage and resolution, they're the best out of the dozens of models I've tested in the last five years.</p><p>These are the definite endgame IEMs; everything about the Valhalla screams excess, and Thieaudio did a masterful job with the product. Like I said at the start, you can get great sound without shelling out anywhere as much cash, but if you already have several IEMs and want something that's the best, you'll want to get these.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cbd48db6-215c-45a3-90c6-21ee31cbf343">            <a href="https://www.linsoul.com/products/thieaudio-valhalla" data-model-name="Thieaudio Valhalla" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:94.33%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yNcaiaTibGae59DbxY3wLT.jpg' alt="Thieaudio Valhalla listing render"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Thieaudio Valhalla</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With 19 drivers in each ear and sublime tuning, Thieaudio's Valhalla stands out as an endgame IEM like no other. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Not everyone likes to journal. Writing has always been a fun, creative outlet for me, which explains how I made a career out of it. But I’ve never consciously penned down my personal thoughts or considered it as a means to organise my mind and understand my emotions.</p><p>This year was extremely challenging for me, riddled with mental turmoil and several panic-induced breakdowns sprinkled throughout the year — thank God for therapy! However, there are some really deep, ugly, dark, and painful thoughts that you cannot voice out, even to an unbiased therapist who literally gets paid to help you navigate your mind non-judgmentally. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-pixel-journal">Journal app, also known as Pixel Journal</a>, helped me process those feelings, get them out of my system, and understand them better.</p><p>Why did I wait until reaching 28 years of age to start journaling as an emotional outlet? Well, it’s not the first time I’ve had a “diary” of sorts. At the very vulnerable age of seven, I had a precious fruit-scented diary with a lock and key. I remember excitedly scribbling in there, confessing my feelings and logging my emotions diligently for weeks. That was until my siblings got their hands on it and decided to read it out loud together, leaving me deeply humiliated. In retrospect, I placed way too much confidence in a cheap little locked diary from the dollar store. Then again, I was seven.</p><p>Oddly, that fear of someone coming across my journal and ridiculing my innermost thoughts never went away. At least, not until I bought my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro</a> this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wcfgixuhygHpE7MCm7BS8G" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-39" alt="Pixel Journal AI insight on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wcfgixuhygHpE7MCm7BS8G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A phone is such a personal possession. We already keep so many of our most hidden thoughts and facets of our persona in there, whether it’s texts between besties or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">secretly locked folders</a> of photos you want no one to have access to. It might even be something as silly as your internet search history, seriously lame music, or questionable e-books. A smartphone is already like a diary or a journal. It’s a trustworthy companion in life that won’t blab or snitch. And it’s password-protected!</p><p>So when I was setting up my Pixel 10 Pro and came across the Journal app, I finally felt comfortable enough to let go of some heavy burdens. Things that keep me up at night, old hurts that drive me insane at times, all of the things that my anxiety likes to mull over again and again, and the voices in my head that are too loud at times.</p><p>I was not expecting it to help us much as it did, but I am so glad I had the courage to start. It’s not like Pixel Journal is some magical app that made my problems disappear. I recognize that it’s not dramatically different from any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mental-health-apps">mental health app I could have downloaded from the Play Store</a> that lets you log specific dates, add pictures, or create lists. But the fact that it came pre-loaded in my phone and felt so seamlessly integrated with my phone’s UI really helped. Undeniably, though, the AI features did wonders for me.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="mkR8b2D2CWkPLRunB6jR4X" name="Google-Pixel-10-Journal" alt="Pixel 10 Journal app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mkR8b2D2CWkPLRunB6jR4X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3587" height="2018" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What’s unique about the Google Pixel Journal app is the AI-powered prompts and summaries. They validate you, prompt you to think, and help you learn from your experiences. I’ve gotten very valuable feedback from the midnight rantings of my deranged, anxious mind. The Journal learns from your past logs and even gives you prompts based on past topics, helping you grow.</p><p>You can go back in time by looking at the built-in calendar and getting a sense of how you were feeling during a specific week or month. You can tag journal entries with emotions and topics. Things like the font type and color can be customized. The app is connected to your Google Photos and lets you add pictures, videos, locations, and even Health Connect info!</p><p>Apart from all these amazing features, I also love that the app is password-protected, which helps protect your privacy. All entries are backed up to your Google account, but all AI processing is done locally on the device. If you want to understand why on-device processing is important, I highly recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">this fantastic article</a> written by my senior colleague, Jerry Hildenbrand.

As a chronic overthinker, overachiever, and over-planner, my anxiety peaks around this time of the year. Maybe because I’m so much more in tune with my thoughts, I don’t feel as scared this year.</p><p>I’m going to enter the new year with a handy mental wellness tool that helped me so much over the last two to three months of 2025.

Instead of delivering either of those, Google might have just been playing the long game, waiting until the chips fell into place so it could do just that, but with this new software.</p><h2 id="chromebooks-and-tablets-aren-t-dead-or-dying-2">Chromebooks and tablets aren't dead, or dying</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless of the sensationalized headlines you might find yourself coming across, neither Chromebooks nor tablets is actually going anywhere. Even with the supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report">Pixel Laptop</a> expected to be debuted at some point in 2026, this will just be an additional hardware category, as opposed to being a replacement for an existing one.</p><p>"How can you be sure?" you might be asking. In November, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/more-and-more-people-are-buying-tablets-and-chromebooks-and-we-dont-really-know-why">a report from Omdia</a> claimed that tablet shipments are up by more than 5% compared to 2023, with Chromebooks growing by about 3.1%. Arguably just as impressive is that tablets have continued to grow in popularity for "seven consecutive quarters."</p><p>So not only is there still an apparent demand, but it may also indicate that the market is ready for something different. We're already starting to see it with Android phones, courtesy of Samsung's and Huawei's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-my-biggest-concerns" target="_blank">tri-foldable</a> phones.

Although it didn't come to fruition in the way I thought it might, we did see smaller powerhouse tablets such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo/3-reasons-why-this-is-the-android-tablet-you-should-buy">Legion Tab Gen 3</a>, Lenovo Y700 (Gen 4), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-astra-oled-gaming-tablet-ive-always-wanted">RedMagic Astra</a>.

But more importantly, I'm keeping my fingers crossed that more companies enter the mix. It would be awesome to see Samsung release a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">flagship Android tablet</a> in the footprint of the Galaxy Tab A9.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HF5TNkSTxxzmi7PHkFDGyT" name="google-pixel-tablet-photo-display-docked" alt="The Google Pixel Tablet showing a picture of a deep blue hydrangea, pulled from Google Photos while docked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HF5TNkSTxxzmi7PHkFDGyT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the flip side of things, even with the Pixel Laptop thingamajig probably on the way, I'm still holding out hope for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die">Pixel Tablet 2</a>.

That's not to say I think this is what's going to happen, but I do think that Google has to walk a tightrope if that's the path it chooses to follow.</p><p>Then again, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mobile-tech-market-2026-what-we-expect-want-to-see">skyrocketing RAM and storage prices</a> due to shortages could mean that 2026 ends up being another boring year with OEMs not willing to provide any groundbreaking releases.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> are easily among the best phones you can buy today, and these brands are doing a better job selling their devices outside Asia.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, I predict a continuation of the dominance around imaging, with even bigger cameras and better tuning. I also see the likes of OPPO and Vivo establishing a solid presence in Western markets, rivaling Xiaomi and Huawei.</p><h2 id="cameras-that-are-even-better-2">Cameras that are even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra next to X100 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2wG7Rvpw2WMXeR8bvZ3PUS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you need the best possible cameras on a phone, you'll need to get the Vivo X200 Ultra, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, or the Vivo X300 Pro — there's no question about that.  With the X300 Pro delivering noticeable gains over its predecessor, where does Vivo take things in 2026? There's obviously going to be an X300 Ultra, and that should also get a 200MP tele lens.</p><p>Where I see Vivo differentiating its Ultra models is with the tuning; this was evident on the X300 Pro, and it's clear that Vivo wants to focus on its tuning algorithms as much as the physical sensors it uses on its phones. That's a good thing, because it allows the brand to meaningfully stand out against its closest rivals.</p><p>In a similar vein, I see OPPO and Xiaomi going all-out with their Ultra models, and I'm excited to see what they can deliver. While Xiaomi was the only brand out of the trio to sell its Ultra models outside China, that may change in 2026, with both OPPO and Vivo set to launch their best phones globally.</p><h2 id="increased-global-presence-2">Increased global presence</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's the point of having a brilliant phone if it's limited to just a few countries? While Vivo and OPPO focused on Asian markets, that narrative is changing, and either brand is keen on building out a presence in the West. OPPO introduced the Find X9 and X9 Pro in the U.K., and Vivo debuted the X300 and X300 Pro in Germany and other markets in the region.</p><p>While either brand had a limited presence in these countries, they didn't market their products aggressively — that's going to change in 2026. In conversations with both brands, I got the feeling that they're enthused about expanding outside Asia in earnest.</p><h2 id="better-panels-2">Better panels</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UJrtmQvHNUNAbmwScLopTm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UJrtmQvHNUNAbmwScLopTm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest wave of Chinese phones has a meaningful display upgrade: they go down to 1 nit. Chinese manufacturers have closely collaborated with display vendor BOE to deliver this, but the downside is that the resolution is lowered to 1.5K. There's no tangible difference in day-to-day usability between 1.5K and 2K.</p><p>That said, we should get phones with 2K panels that go to 1nit in low-light use in 2026. BOE is doing all the right things in this area, and it's clear that the manufacturer is able to work with phone brands to tailor panels to their needs.</p><h2 id="even-bigger-batteries-2">Even bigger batteries</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4911px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm" name="Vivo X300 Pro" alt="Vivo X300 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FApPDYXvSSvCAod9WBcERm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4911" height="2766" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My Find X9 Pro has a 7,500mAh battery, and the phone lasts a day and a half with heavy use. Battery sizes are only going to increase in 2026, with brands set to cross 8,000mAh. This is made possible by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-talked-to-the-brand-thats-revolutionizing-silicon-battery-tech" target="_blank">silicon-carbon tech</a>; the initial wave of phones with these batteries had 10% silicon in the anode, but silicon content is increasing, allowing brands to fit ever-larger batteries into their phones while still retaining a thin-and-light design.</p><p>Silicon batteries are just better; the greater density means the phones aren't bulky, and they hold up much better in challenging weather conditions.</p><h2 id="limited-dram-2">Limited DRAM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZCbrBGUuQLADnfxRtFKtfS" name="Vivo X200 Ultra" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra back view against a grey background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZCbrBGUuQLADnfxRtFKtfS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We got phones with 1TB of RAM and 24GB of RAM, and while these models tend to be limited to China, I don't see this trend lasting. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">meteoric rise in DRAM prices</a> means brands will only deliver 12GB of RAM on their phones in 2026, and that will likely be the case even with 512GB and 1TB storage configurations.</p><p>Whether that's going to be enough in the AI-everything era needs to be seen. As it stands, I don't see any problems with 12GB of RAM on Android, but as more and more brands start switching to on-device AI models, it may turn into a bottleneck. Regardless, if you need 16GB of RAM, you'll want to buy a phone that's available now instead of waiting for a 2026 device.</p><p>I don't see the status quo changing too much with Chinese manufacturers in 2026. OPPO and Vivo will be looking to increase their imaging lead, and while Xiaomi didn't have a strong 2025, I want to see the brand do better next year. Huawei is once again likely to roll out a roster of devices with meaningful innovation (I'm testing its latest products, and they're wild), and Realme is guaranteed to deliver phones with the biggest batteries.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you buy it before the end of the year, you can choose a free folio case or a free stylus with your purchase.</p><p>At a glance, you’re getting a familiar OnePlus design language wrapped around a more budget-friendly core. The Pad Go 2 features a slim aluminum body, slim bezels, and a large display built for streaming, browsing, and light productivity.</p><p>The screen itself is a big selling point. You’re staring at a massive 12.1-inch LCD display that cranks up to a 120Hz refresh rate. With 900 nits of peak brightness, you can use it even outside on a sunny day, which is unusual for tablets in this price range. While it’s not OLED, it should still work well for daily use.</p><h2 id="solid-mid-range-specs-2">Solid mid-range specs</h2><p>Inside, OnePlus replaced the older Helio G99 with the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Ultra. It won’t outperform a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but for streaming, light work, and casual gaming, it does the job well.</p><p>You’re also getting 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage, which you can expand via a microSD slot. That last part is a dying feature, so seeing it here is a genuine win for media hoarders.</p><p>This tablet has a 10,050mAh battery, which is much larger than the 8,000mAh battery in the first-gen OnePlus Pad Go. OnePlus says it can last for over 50 hours of music or 15 hours of video.</p><p>The software is a strong point for the Pad Go 2. It comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">OxygenOS</a> for tablets, which includes split-screen multitasking, floating windows, and better app scaling than standard Android on large screens.</p><p>If you already have a OnePlus phone, features like quick file sharing and synced notifications help the tablet fit smoothly into your setup.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="f169430e-e50c-4728-b2b3-53308f602527">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/buy-oneplus-pad-go-2" data-model-name="OnePlus Pad Go 2" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGFhQScxHXASBwNTT2xnCC.jpg' alt="OnePlus Pad Go 2 back panel"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus Pad Go 2</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The OnePlus Pad Go 2 brings a big 120Hz display, solid performance, long battery life, and smart software to the US at a price that actually makes sense.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

At the moment, Samsung largely relies on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Google Gemini</a> for deeper and complex queries. The company's own Bixby assistant, on the other hand, are limited to basic tasks and commands.</p><p>For some time now, Samsung has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">rumored to be working with Perplexity</a> to give Bixby a much-needed AI upgrade. With this integration, Bixby would continue managing basic system actions like toggling settings or opening apps, while Perplexity would step in to answer more complex, web-backed queries complete with citations, similar to how Apple tapped OpenAI's ChatGPT to handle advanced requests in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-material-3-expressive-vs-ios-26-liquid-glass">iOS 26</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-looks-to-fix-bixby-s-biggest-weakness-2">Samsung looks to fix Bixby's biggest weakness</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Zu3yHtJwYFXFAddL5xS2oV" name="samsung-bixby-perplexity-leak" alt="Perplexity-powered answers in Bixby" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Zu3yHtJwYFXFAddL5xS2oV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @achultra on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The feature was initially rumored to debut alongside the Galaxy S26 series, but signs of it have already appeared in the latest One UI 8.5 beta. A screenshot shared by the user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/achultra/status/2004884916161704262">@achultra on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-quietly-boosts-bixby-with-perplexity-ai-in-one-ui-8-5/">SammyGuru</a>) shows Bixby responses clearly powered by Perplexity.</p><p>We weren't able to get the feature working on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> running the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-official-galaxy-s25-series">One UI 8.5 beta</a>. However, the shared screenshot shows a complex query (involving a French-language question about weather) being answered by Bixby with Perplexity listed as the source.</p><p>Samsung already offers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/samsung-perplexity-ai-tv-experience-thats-more-than-just-shows">free Perplexity Pro access</a> for Galaxy smartphone users and has been using Perplexity-powered answers on its smart TVs and other appliances. Still, this marks the first time we're seeing signs of that integration making its way to Samsung smartphones.</p><p>While the feature was originally expected to launch exclusively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S26 lineup</a>, this early appearance gives us a clearer idea of how the integration will work. If rolled out widely, it could finally give Samsung users a strong alternative to Google Gemini, and we expect to see more developments around this in the coming days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Artificial intelligence experienced growth in 2025, with companies offering strong challenges to OpenAI for the first time.</p><p>Google used its corporate might to release more AI-powered features than any other company, Meta used its stockpile of cash to acquire top talent, and OpenAI made big bets looking toward the future. At the same time, smaller companies Perplexity and Anthropic took significant strides, but still look more like acquisition targets than serious threats. And then there's Microsoft, a company that may have tied its horse to OpenAI and an AI PC strategy too soon.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, I'm predicting a year of reckoning. Multiple companies made promises that they'll have to deliver on next year, like Samsung's smart glasses or OpenAI's upcoming hardware product. Additionally, the results of pending lawsuits and possible AI regulation could loom over the industry in 2026. Here's everything I'm expecting from the AI industry next year, plus what I want to see.</p><h2 id="brand-deals-and-lawsuits-will-set-the-tone-for-ai-in-2026-2">Brand deals and lawsuits will set the tone for AI in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uZsDWnq2PmSPxmGVuJ2Gjj" name="OpenAI-Disney-deal" alt="OpenAI next to Disney logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZsDWnq2PmSPxmGVuJ2Gjj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-2025-report-card">my AI report card for 2025</a>, I noted that it's hard to judge OpenAI's year because the company prioritized its future over its present. The biggest OpenAI move came just a few weeks before the new year — it inked a deal with Disney that'll see the entertainment giant invest $1 billion in equity into OpenAI. As part of the move, OpenAI will get exclusive access to Disney's intellectual property with over 200 licensed characters. Starting in early 2026, users will be able <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/openai-sora-video-generator-vs-google-veo-3">to generate Sora videos</a> with Disney characters.</p><p>It's a big move for both companies, as the three-year licensing agreement gives OpenAI the legal use of Disney characters, with Disney presumably receiving financial kickbacks in return. OpenAI impressively got Disney to throw money its way as part of the deal, too. Perhaps most importantly, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/disney-hits-google-with-a-cease-and-desist-over-ai-copyright-claims">Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter</a> over the company's use and generation of copyrighted material by its AI models.</p><p>How this all plays out will certainly guide the AI industry in 2026. For now, I can still generate Disney characters with Google AI models, which raises a ton of questions. Will Disney slap Google with a full-on lawsuit over its alleged copyright violations? Does legal access to Disney material give OpenAI the edge it needs over competitors as the AI race tightens? Is Disney really making enough money from this deal to justify giving up its most valuable assets to an AI company?</p><p>I'm looking forward to all of these questions being answered in 2026. This is just one of the developments involving brand deals and legal challenges for AI companies in 2026. There are multiple lawsuits filed by brands such as the New York Times, Ziff Davis, Thomson Reuters, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sustainabletechpartner.com/topics/ai/generative-ai-lawsuit-timeline/" target="_blank">others</a> that aim to force governments to decide whether training AI models on copyrighted material is legal.</p><p>In 2026, I want to see these legal questions answered, ideally with a bit of much-needed AI regulation in the mix. I'm also curious whether competitors like Google or Meta try to copy OpenAI's deal with Disney — next year could quickly become the race to secure brand deals with IP holders.</p><h2 id="less-ai-slop-and-more-thoughtful-features-2">Less AI slop and more thoughtful features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Xo5yF4jw4KQacoCdKnZ63m" name="meta-ai-app-with-donald-trump-ai-slop" alt="An AI-generated video of Donald Trump serving food to other world leaders in the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xo5yF4jw4KQacoCdKnZ63m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It goes without saying that not every AI feature is bad, but many are. AI-generated content hit new lows in 2025, prompting Merriam-Webster to select "slop" as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/wordplay/word-of-the-year" target="_blank">word of the year</a>, defined as "digital content of low quality that is produced usually in quantity by means of artificial intelligence." In 2026, I want to see less slop and more truly useful features.</p><p>Brands, if you're reading this, stop sticking AI where it doesn't belong. I don't need Meta AI in my Instagram search bar or my WhatsApp DMs. I certainly<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-needs-to-stop-the-ai-slop-before-it-kills-its-best-products"> don't need an infinite-scroll feed of AI slop in the Meta AI app</a> required to manage my collection of Ray-Ban Meta and Oakley Meta smart glasses.</p><p>Meta is an underrated player in the AI industry, especially given its NBA-style contracts for top engineering talent, totaling hundreds of millions in compensation over multi-year deals. Next year, it needs to stop getting in its own way. Create thoughtful AI features that users seek out willingly, and remove the slop shoved into apps that are awesome otherwise.</p><p>Meta certainly isn't the only company doing this; it's simply the worst offender. Other AI companies should watch and learn what <em>not</em> to do, making sure to only include features in their best apps that make sense.</p><h2 id="i-want-to-see-what-samsung-google-and-openai-are-cooking-2">I want to see what Samsung, Google, and OpenAI are cooking</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3840px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R3pj7qTnTK5tyddn3thAFY" name="Android-XR-prototype-glasses" alt="A still from the Android Show: XR Edition showing Juston Payne wearing the Google prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R3pj7qTnTK5tyddn3thAFY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3840" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A still from the Android Show: XR Edition showing Juston Payne wearing the Google prototype glasses. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I mentioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> as something to watch in my AI preview article for 2025, and I'm bringing it up again in 2026. That puts quite a bit of pressure on Google, the one building the software platform, and Samsung, the one curating the hardware. Eventually, the Android XR teasers and demos that keep trickling out aren't enough, and we need to see results. We finally got <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-galaxy-xr">Samsung's Galaxy XR headset</a> in 2025, but I'm looking forward to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/leaked-details-on-samsungs-xr-smart-glasses-transition-lenses-and-built-in-camera">Samsung's upcoming pair of smart glasses</a> even more.</p><p>I use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-meta-smart-glasses-should-you-buy">Meta smart glasses</a> because they're the best available right now, in my opinion, not because I'm particularly attached to Meta as a company. If Google or Samsung made a better or comparable pair of smart glasses that fit better into the Android ecosystem, there's a strong likelihood I'd be compelled to switch. That's why, in 2026, I need to finally see what Google and Samsung are cooking up. Are these companies going to challenge Meta on day one, or will their initial offerings feel lightyears behind?</p><p>As for what Samsung's XR glasses could do to win me over, expanded prescription lens support, better open-air speakers, sharper camera quality, and more comfortable frame designs are at the top of my wishlist.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oGfoAaCguzXd9tDSyTwKuR" name="ChatGPT-OpenAI-logo-on-glasses-and-watch.jpg" alt="OpenAI ChatGPT logo on a pair of smart glasses and a smart watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oGfoAaCguzXd9tDSyTwKuR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and I'd also love to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/jony-ive-and-sam-altman-confirm-openai-finally-has-a-prototype-for-its-super-secret-ai-device-set-to-launch-in-less-than-2-years">what OpenAI is working on with Jony Ive</a> on the hardware front. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ive-tested-gemini-3-and-it-proves-google-has-what-it-takes-to-win-the-ai-race">Gemini is slowly catching up to ChatGPT</a>, and I think it's because Google has products and services people use every day, giving it unparalleled integration avenues. OpenAI can't build the next Android or replace Google Search and Workspace overnight, so its best option is to make an AI hardware product that actually catches on.</p><p>As an iPod kid at heart, I have skeptical faith in Ive. But like Google and Samsung, OpenAI will need to show me something tangible in 2026 to make me a believer.</p><p>AI models like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 3 </a>and GPT-5.2 are so good these days that the updates are starting to feel incremental. The next thing to watch is how these AI models will be implemented. For example, whether a brand deals with IP holders like Disney or hardware releases like XR glasses will define the next stage of the AI race. Whether the courts or legislators will take any steps to regulate the AI industry or protect copyrighted material.</p><p>In other words, 2026 is going to be an important year for AI, one way or another.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Plus, I have an outside-the-box request for Android phone makers and a big concern about how AI-generated content will affect the music industry.</p><p>Here's what I expect to see from the audio industry in 2026 (and everything I hope happens).</p><h2 id="audio-brands-give-us-aptx-adaptive-lossless-all-the-things-2">Audio brands... give us aptX Adaptive + Lossless all the things</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dfg73ixPDofdxMHJ7LLTXj" name="Fiio BT11" alt="Fiio BT11 Bluetooth 5.4 transmitter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dfg73ixPDofdxMHJ7LLTXj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While I love seeing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> like Apple Music, Tidal, and now Spotify offer high-fidelity lossless audio to subscribers, they won't matter much without the right hardware — and the right software. The fact is, most of us use wireless headphones and earbuds, and the overwhelming majority of them use lossy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">Bluetooth audio codecs</a> that negate the benefits of lossless streaming.</p><p>The frustrating part of this situation is that we've already solved the problem. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx">Qualcomm's </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/qualcomm-aptx" target="_blank">aptX audio codecs</a> have enabled CD-quality lossless wireless audio transmission with aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless. Unfortunately, many top Android brands simply refuse to make these codecs available on their devices. That's true even on phones with the hardware required to use aptX Adaptive or aptX Lossless.</p><p>In the U.S., the only major phones with aptX Lossless come from Asus, Sony, and Motorola, and the word "major" is generous for at least two of those brands. International phones from Xiaomi and others are more forgiving on the global market, but aptX Adaptive and aptX Lossless are still too rare on Android phones, wireless headphones, and earbuds.</p><p>In 2026, I'm hoping to see more headphones, earbuds, and phones leverage Qualcomm's complete Snapdragon Sound platform to make wireless lossless audio mainstream. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">small dongles can bring aptX Lossless to any phone</a>, Android users deserve a proper built-in solution.</p><h2 id="make-bluetooth-le-audio-and-auracast-matter-2">Make Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast matter</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2916px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi" name="audio-sharing-via-bluetooth-auracast-google-pixel-10-pro-lifestyle" alt="Audio sharing via Bluetooth Auracast on a Pixel 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vRWD3UZkitrSbW2bPQbNKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2916" height="1640" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to the point about aptX Lossless, I hope <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/accessories-report-card-2025">Bluetooth LE Audio and Auracast</a> become commonplace in 2026. These standards are groundbreaking and have significant potential, but they need to be widely implemented for users to benefit from them.</p><p>Specifically, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">LE Audio</a> has the potential to deliver wireless audio signals more efficiently, preserving battery life. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a> is an incredible accessibility tool that can broadcast an audio source to many receivers, like Bluetooth LE Audio headphones or earbuds.</p><p>The idea that Auracast is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me">only for people who need hearing assistance</a> is a misconception. There are so many clever uses for Auracast, and we've started to see them pop up in 2025. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.victrola.com/products/wave-bluetooth-turntable-with-auracast" target="_blank">Victrola debuted a Bluetooth turntable</a> with both aptX Adaptive and Auracast support.

And of course, I want to see public infrastructure widely support Auracast so that important announcements are accessible to all. To do that, we need to get the government, companies, and users all on board in 2026.</p><h2 id="higher-quality-open-earbuds-and-smart-glasses-speakers-2">Higher-quality open earbuds and smart glasses speakers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm" name="Meta-Oakley-Vanguard-Prescription-7" alt="Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses with prescription inserts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CDpEzy3miL6fTa2yxGmhxm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I thought open earbuds and speakers were a gimmick until I tried the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Moto Buds Loop open earbuds</a> and Oakley Meta Vanguard smart glasses in 2025.

Now, the hardware on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android phones</a> needs to change to accommodate lossless streaming. That leads us to my oddball feature request for 2026: phones with multiple USB-C ports.</p><p>This actually isn't as crazy a suggestion as it might seem, because a few phones already have multiple USB-C ports. Specifically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">Asus ROG Phone 9 and 9 Pro</a> both offer two USB-C ports. I've made my peace with losing the 3.5mm headphone jack, but it's time that phones regain that wired versatility — and then some — by adding a secondary USB-C port.</p><p>For audiophiles, an extra USB-C port enables connection with wired headphones, USB digital-to-analog converters, and other streaming accessories while leaving a port available for charging. That's crucial, because lossless downloading and streaming consume a lot of battery, and throwing a USB DAC into the mix uses up even more power. Beyond music streaming, an extra USB-C port would make it easier to use accessories like portable SSDs or mobile game controllers while keeping a connector free for charging.</p><p>Again, it sounds wild, but if you asked me whether I'd rather have a siloed S-Pen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> or an extra USB-C port, I know which one I'm picking.</p><h2 id="unfortunately-we-ll-have-to-keep-dodging-ai-generated-songs-2">Unfortunately, we'll have to keep dodging AI-generated songs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1605px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="uGsRKAq58ok5zxuiCNzH43" name="toro-y-moi-google-io-2025-3" alt="Toro y Moi on stage at I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uGsRKAq58ok5zxuiCNzH43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1605" height="903" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A DJ making music generated with artificial intelligence at Google I/O 2025.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This last one is a <em>prediction</em>, not a wish: it's going to get harder to discern AI-generated artists from real musicians in 2026. If you've been paying attention, this is already happening in 2025.</p><p>Over the summer, a band called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/14/an-ai-generated-band-got-1m-plays-on-spotify-now-music-insiders-say-listeners-should-be-warned" target="_blank">Velvet Sundown appeared on Spotify</a> and gained millions of listeners — except it wasn't a band at all. The artist's popular songs were generated with artificial intelligence, or as the band put it, were created as "a synthetic music project guided by human creative direction."</p><p>AI-generated songs are an easy way for people to "earn" coveted streaming royalties with little effort, and they're only going to get more prevalent over time. With a combination of AI-generated songs, images, and potentially even deepfake music videos, it'll become more difficult to be sure your new favorite artist is a real person or band. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-wont-share-streaming-data-with-billboard-in-2026">If you care about supporting real artists</a>, watch out for AI-generated content that goes viral or appears in your suggestions in 2026.</p><p>If there's a theme in my 2026 wishlist for the audio industry, it's that I want brands to make the most of emerging technologies. Bluetooth LE Audio, Auracast, and aptX Adaptive are all neat, but they need to be widely available at the consumer level to make a real difference. And music fans, let's come together in 2026 and avoid listening to the AI-generated content that's bound to keep popping up.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This mysteriously named battery tech is none other than solid-state batteries, and there's a good chance we might see more of them in future gadgets and accessories -- many likely revealed at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ces">CES 2026</a>.</p><p>Although very expensive, solid-state batteries have a significant advantage over the standard lithium-ion batteries commonly used today. As Android Central's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/faster-charging-isnt-the-answer-we-need-better-batteries">Jerry Hildenbrand put it</a>, "they have a ton of capacity without being any bigger, are safer, and provide higher output at low battery levels. They're still lithium-based, but solid electrolytes like ceramics don't explode when they get hot."</p><p>If the rumors are true, Samsung will likely use these "dream batteries" in more products beyond just its wearables. This could be the push that the industry needs to stay relevant, and more and more competitors could rush to adopt the standard just to go up against Samsung.</p><p>What's even cooler is the potential of seeing solid-state <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">power banks</a>. Currently, most airlines have limitations on battery pack capacity. But solid-state batteries could change that. Since the tech is much safer, we could see high-capacity power banks receive IATA approval, allowing us to travel with much larger ones in the future.</p><p>While a handful of solid-state power banks do exist, I'm banking on this niche to thrive in 2026.</p><h2 id="maximalism-is-on-the-rise-in-phone-case-brands-2">Maximalism is on the rise in phone case brands</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3902px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aoFprjayjkZudwhvYMaQCE" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-3" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aoFprjayjkZudwhvYMaQCE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3902" height="2195" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Minimalism is out, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.voguearabia.com/article/maximalist-fashion-making-a-return">maximalism is in</a>.

All of this begs the question: What will the next evolution of E Ink look like?</p><p>Smart home brand SwitchBot launched an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.switch-bot.com/products/switchbot-ai-art-frame">AI Art Frame</a> last month, and it made me realize that we have only scratched the surface. The brand's AI Art Frame comes in various sizes, uses the latest E Ink Spectra 6 color e-ink display, and charges via USB-C. Because these frames use e-paper tech, you only need to charge them <strong>once every two years</strong>!</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised if 2026 brought some strange new innovations in this category. In fact, I'm almost expecting it on some level. Imagine the possible applications of E Ink tech that we haven't even thought of yet?</p><p>All in all, 2026 is shaping up to be a very exciting year for the accessories industry. I can't wait to see which of my predictions come true, and which of my expectations are met.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the experience has generally been smooth and feature-rich, one notable omission has been Google Photos support (which is also missing on Google TV). That is finally about to change.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-plans-to-bring-google-photos-to-samsung-ai-tv-lineup-helping-users-relive-their-favorite-memories-on-the-big-screen">has announced</a> that it will soon bring Google Photos to Samsung TVs, allowing users to enjoy their most meaningful moments on a larger, more immersive screen. However, the company is not bringing the full <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app just yet.

This feature will roll out beginning in March 2026.</p><p>Later in 2026, Samsung plans to add more Google Photos capabilities, including Create with AI, which lets you use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana</a> to generate themed templates, and Remix to transform image styles, as well as Photo to Video that animates still moments into short clips. Users will also eventually be able to view their photos as topic-based slideshows.</p><p>In simple terms, instead of offering full library access on TV, Samsung intends Google Photos to be woven into the smart TV experience. Samsung says users will begin seeing Photos integrated naturally throughout the day via Daily+ and Daily Board once they are signed into their Google account.</p><p>Samsung says Google Photos will start arriving on select Samsung TV models starting in 2026 via a software update later in the year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This chip supports both non-terrestrial networks (NTN) and next-generation 5G in one device. Simply put, it’s designed to communicate directly with satellites while still handling standard cellular networks efficiently.</p><p>Samsung says the modem supports 3GPP Release 17 standards, which is the foundation for satellite-based mobile communication. That’s the same framework carriers and satellite operators are building around globally.

OnePlus launched its 13 series at the start of 2025, and now, just before we close the year, we already have the 15 series. Early adopters should rightfully be mad at OnePlus for making their 2025 purchase obsolete within the year itself. Thankfully, OnePlus has made sure this doesn't happen.</p><p>In a strange plot twist, the OnePlus 15 might actually be worse off than the OnePlus 13 series, particularly when it comes to the newly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">OnePlus 15R</a>. Some things are better, like the waterproofing, processor, and battery capacity, but is it all worth $100 more than the 13R? We're about to find out.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-design-and-display-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OnePlus had an iconic circular camera island design for the past two generations, but that's been traded in for a more generic look with the new 15 series. The OnePlus 15R looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13s</a>, the compact flagship from mid-2025. The 15R has a pretty forgettable design, and its colors don't really help it stand out. The Electric violet shade is the only fun color, but that's limited to just one region for now.</p><p>Build quality is solid nonetheless, and the OnePlus 15R comes with an upgraded fingerprint sensor and up to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 rating</a> for dust and water resistance. It's thicker and heavier than the OnePlus 13R, which is noticeable. The 15R also misses out on the classic Alert slider, which has been replaced by a customizable "Plus Key" button.</p><p>One of the 15R's big redeeming qualities is its display. OnePlus has used a 1.5K resolution LTPS AMOLED panel, and we've <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">found it to be extremely good</a>. The company is hyping the 165Hz refresh rate, but this is only really usable in a handful of games. Under normal usage, the display runs at 120Hz for the most part. OnePlus uses a custom Panda glass for scratch protection that isn't as impact-resistant as Corning's solution.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpfFcHfSZwGgVhgaKoCiWo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnPlus 13R is instantly recognizable as a OnePlus device. It's lighter and slimmer than the 15R, making it easier to hold and use for longer periods. It retains the Alert slider, which we've all come to know and love over the years, letting you quickly switch between silent, vibration, and ringer modes.</p><p>The phone uses the older-style optical fingerprint sensor, which is not bad, but it won't be as accurate or quick as the ultrasonic one used in the 15R. The last bit, where the 13R lags behind, is the waterproofing. With just an IP65 rating, the phone is only rated to withstand splashes of water, not heavy ingress or submersion.</p><p>The display of the OnePlus 13R holds up well against the 15R. It's roughly the same size and resolution, and even though the refresh rate is just 120Hz, it can get much brighter, reaching 4,500 nits at peak. OnePlus also uses something called Aqua Touch on the 13R's panel, which essentially lets you use the display normally even if water is on it.</p><p>Between the two phones, based on design alone, I'd pick the OnePlus 13R. It also comes in just two colors, but I think it looks better, and I love the fact that it's lighter.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-specs-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZS8ks88Dxp57PZb9kCs4vS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R is one of the first phones to feature Qualcomm's newest value-flagship chip, called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>. If you're confused about the naming convention, you're not alone. It's a step down from the Elite-branded chips but is also slightly more potent than the 8 Gen 3 chip found in the 13R.</p><p>For starters, it's built on a smaller 3nm node (vs. 4nm), uses Oryon CPU cores similar to those in Qualcomm's laptop chips, and packs newer Wi-Fi and 5G modems. In short, the 15R will deliver higher benchmark scores than the 13R, but for most day-to-day tasks, there shouldn't be any tangible difference.</p><p>The new power-efficient chip and a much larger 7,400mAh battery allow the 15R to achieve much better battery life figures. You can easily use this phone for two days straight without any worry about charging. There's no wireless charging, just like the 13R, but you get 80W fast charging, and the charger comes in the box.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R starts at $700 for 12GB RAM and 256GB storage, and the $800 for 512GB of storage. OnePlus has kept the RAM the same across storage tiers, unlike before. The phone only comes in two colors — Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>OnePlus 15R</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>OnePlus 13R</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>OxygenOS 16 (based on Android 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (up to four OS upgrades)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Charcoal Black, Mint Breeze, Electric Violet (India only)</p></td><td  ><p>Astral Trail, Nebula Noir</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.83 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,800 x 1,272</p></td><td  ><p>2,780 x 1,264</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>1.5K AMOLED</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>165Hz LTPS</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz LTPO</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB (not expadandable; 512GB only for Charcoal Black)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, <br>50MP telephoto,<br>8MP ultra-wide, 16MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers, Dolby Atmos support</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers, Dolby Atmos support</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>6,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69, IP69K</p></td><td  ><p>IP65</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>163.41 x 77.04 x 8.3 mm</p></td><td  ><p>161.7 x 75.8 x 8 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>214-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>206 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The OnePlus 13R is still retailing for the same $600 that it launched at. This is for the 12GB RAM and 256GB storage variant. In some regions like India, you can even get a 16GB/ 512GB variant. Of course, the 13R can also be found at discounted prices during sales, something the 15R won't see for a while.</p><p>The 13R uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which is still a very capable chip from 2024. There is some thermal throttling that kicks in after 30 minutes of sustained load, but this threshold is still better than what we saw on the OnePlus 13. Performance is fantastic, be it gaming or multitasking.</p><p>Battery life is equally good thanks to the 6,000mAh capacity. Just like the 15R, you can expect to go up to two full days before needing to charge it again. Charging time is a bit longer, though, as the 13R uses a single-cell battery vs. dual cells.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM" name="oneplus-15r-165hz-gaming-call-of-duty-mobile" alt="Playing Call of Duty Mobile at 165Hz on a OnePlus 15R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Yxvqxb3irwcB7NnPFEHaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus 15R ships with OxygenOS 16, which is based on Android 16.

I'm not sure what possessed OnePlus to remove it when the 13R was the first R-series phone to get it, and we all loved it for it.</p><p>There's a 50MP main and an 8MP ultrawide on the back, but the front camera is upgraded to a 32MP sensor. The main camera module itself is not bad, but the ultrawide is objectively worse than the 13R. Selfies from the 15R should look a bit better compared to the 13R, but be prepared for worse zoom shots.</p><p>The auxiliary cameras on the OnePlus 13R aren't particularly great either, but the phone still delivers good shots with the primary sensor. The telephoto camera with its 2x optical zoom delivers crisp, magnified photos, something that we thought was lacking with the 15R.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-oneplus-13r-the-choice-is-obvious-2">OnePlus 15R vs. OnePlus 13R: The choice is obvious</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda couldn't have said it better in his review — don't buy the OnePlus 15R. The improvements given to it simply do not justify the lost features and higher price. Plus, the fact that it looks pretty uninteresting and boring compared to its predecessor is another reason to avoid it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a>, and even though it might lack some raw benchmark performance, it's still a solid value flagship that's not even been around for a full year. I imagine demand for the 13R should spike, which could put it out of stock sooner than expected, so grab one while you can.</p><p>OnePlus seems to have missed the ball completely on its 15 series, and neither phone is especially impressive when compared to its predecessor. It seems the company is trying to pivot the number series towards the mobile gaming audience, which would explain the focus on bigger batteries and faster displays, and the less importance given to the cameras. I guess the sales of the 15 series will decide if the company will continue down this path or revert back to offering proper value flagships.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5700c699-2d11-4f1d-b944-a70c9968b801">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ktg93UoYYjXreuE4PbAF3o.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15R"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Skip this one</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15R isn't a bad phone, per se, but you'll get more value from the OnePlus 13R which was only launched only in Jan of 2025.

The 1,800-nit peak brightness can drop to 1 nit as needed. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-review">Android Central's Harish Jonnalagadda</a> says the screen is easy on the eyes. But he notes that it only supports 144Hz or 165Hz refresh rates in six game titles. For everything else, it's a basic 120Hz.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15r-display-review">Nicholas Sutrich adds that after testing the phone</a>, he found it uses the most flicker-free OLED he has ever seen, a huge selling point for those with sensitivities. He loves the brightness and outdoor visibility, both of which he describes as excellent, and appreciates the eye care features. He even goes so far as to call its screen one of the best in OLED tech.</p><p>Available in Charcoal Black or Mint Breeze with Velvet Glass technology, the OnePlus 15R features rounded corners and a redesigned camera bump that OnePlus says helps reduce hand fatigue when you hold the phone for long periods.</p><p>The massive 7,400mAh battery is a huge selling point, ensuring the phone lasts a long time and can run in harsh environments. It's made with OnePlus' Silicon NanoStack technology, with 15% silicon content for better energy density. It also supports 55W SUPERVOOC fast charging with the included charger, but can go up to 80W with the OnePlus SUPERVOOC 100W Dual Ports GaN Power Adapter Lite.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xejUWxjskviwPyExv8p6NY" name="oneplus-15r-lockscreen-green-2_edit_86359457934190" alt="A OnePlus 15R with a Flux Themes forest wallpaper on the lockscreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xejUWxjskviwPyExv8p6NY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It does not, however, support wireless charging, which is one of the downsides of the excellent flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a>. It can retain 80% of its capacity after four years, ensuring long-term battery health. Jonnalagadda says the phone easily lasts for up to two days without issue, and even a day and a half with heavy use.</p><p>Like the OnePlus 15, it's ultra durable, meeting not only an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, but also IP66, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, and IP69K. This ensures that the phone can withstand submersion, high-pressure water jets at close range, and higher temperatures. So, from the hot tub to the backyard water gun fight, it can handle it.</p><p>You get 256GB or 512GB storage, the latter only in the Charcoal Black finish, and you can pair it with the Sandstone or hole-pattern magnetic case. You'll get four years of software updates and six years of security updates.</p><p>Overall, Jonnalagadda finds the design to be a downgrade, except for an Electric Violet finish option available only in India. He finds that the Panda glass it uses isn’t as resilient as Corning Gorilla Glass either, despite the tremendous IP ratings.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a back on a red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rY5945qajwXSW5rKd3gTRE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 9a comes in Iris, Peony, Porcelain, or Obsidian and employs a composite matte back and satin metal finish.

It's much brighter at up to 2,700 nits. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Michael Hicks says in his review</a> that it's comfortable to see outdoors with decent color saturation. While watching videos side by side with the step-up Google Pixel 9, he didn't notice any difference in color accuracy or contrast.</p><p>With hard edges and an IP68 dust- and water-resistant rating, it's the first Pixel device without the traditional camera housing, which affords a larger battery and an ultra-slim design. Hicks opines that the camera housing is almost too subtle, but appreciates that it's so thin that it prevents wobbling and that the phone is incredibly lightweight. The design change was also worth it to cram in a bigger battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Its battery is above average at 5,100mAh, which easily lasts over a day, says Hicks, even with heavy use, and can stretch to two days with casual use. But that still doesn't hold a candle to the OnePlus 15R. Still, you get a rated 30+ hours per charge, which can be extended to 100 hours, or just over 4 days, with Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports fast charging, but only at 23W. While it has wireless charging, it's not useful for anything but top-ups and overnight at a snail's pace, 7.5W.</p><p>Get the Google Pixel 9a in 128GB or 256GB storage options, even less than the OnePlus 15R. Both devices are non-expandable, so you'll have to rely on the cloud beyond the internal storage capacities. The Google Pixel 9a does come with a three-month trial subscription to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> that includes additional cloud storage, along with three months of YouTube Premium and six months of Fitbit Premium if you have a companion smartwatch like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a>. So, those are some worthwhile incentives.</p><p>Like all the latest Google Pixel phones, you get seven years of software and security updates.

It is the first phone to launch globally with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> mobile chipset, which affords a faster CPU and GPU and better AI performance overall, but is a step-down from the Elite chip in the OnePlus 15. AI is handled by OnePlus AI and the Plus Mind system alongside integration with Google Gemini.</p><p>OxygenOS 16, based on Android 16, is powered by Intelligent AI, which includes the new Plus Mind, Plus Key, and Mind Space. With this feature, you can press the Plus Key or swipe up with three fingers from the bottom of the phone to take a screenshot and store it in the Mind Space. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/mind-space-app-in-oxygenos-16-bridges-oneplus-ai-with-gemini-for-inspiration">Mind Space area</a> is where you can bookmark key things, like ideas, web pages, e-mails, images, inspiration, key dates, or details. You can even save voice notes.</p><p>From there, you can build ideas, even tap into them with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-gemini-live-video-support-helped-me-grow-plants-in-the-desert">Gemini Live</a> with a simple prompt to do things like build a trip itinerary based on everything you saved, or a summary for a presentation. The phone comes with a three-month trial to Google AI Pro. Supporting all these AI goodies alongside the processor is 12GB LPDDR5X Ultra RAM. There's also UFS 4.1, which ensures fast speeds when transferring or copying data.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kSD93LB5dpiQz76SXfTbyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kSD93LB5dpiQz76SXfTbyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of usability, the phone has several features designed to ensure smooth navigation. Parallel Processing 2.0 facilitates smoother app switching, navigation, and multitasking. The Touch Response Chip supports a 3,200Hz touch sampling rate, so the phone is responsive to your commands, a key feature for multitaskers, content creators, and gamers. With dual app control, you can open and interact with two apps on the screen at once, a feature great for multitaskers.</p><p>As for gamers, this phone features a high-end cooling system designed to prevent overheating during the most intense activities, like gaming. The 360° Cryo Velocity Cooling System includes a Cryo Velocity Screen Cooler under the display for thermal protection, along with the Cryo Velocity 3D Vapor Chamber to cool down the high-end processor.</p><p>There's also a Cryo Velocity Back Cover for additional cooling. However, Jonnalagadda says all of this doesn't do much to curtail overheating in his experience. What's more, most games are still limited to 60fps, so while the phone performs well while gaming, it finds that it isn't hitting its full potential.</p><p>Sutrich disagrees, however, saying that in the few games he played, like <em>Call of Duty Mobile</em> and <em>Clash of Clans</em>, he was blown away by the smoothness and responsiveness, even with games that don't support the 165Hz display refresh mode. Given these differing opinions, it might be worth trying the phone for a few minutes in-store to gauge how you feel while gaming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8CKnZh4FwerdcqXvZjxS5d" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris in the hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8CKnZh4FwerdcqXvZjxS5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 9a offers a hefty AI experience as well, with deep integration with Google Gemini. Loaded with Android 15 OS at launch, it's powered by the Google Tensor G4 processor, ensuring a smooth, pleasant experience. There's also the Titan M2 security chip. The 8GB RAM is a step down, but this phone is still pretty responsive and powerful.</p><p>Naturally, it comes with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> fully built in and all its features, including assistance with everything from writing to snapping pictures, inquiries, and more. There are useful add-ons like Pixel Call Assist, Clear Calling, Call Screen, and Hold for Me. Some new features in the latest Pixel Drop for the Pixel 9a include AI summaries for chats, photo remixing, expanded Scam Detection, and a unified search bar.</p><p>The phone also affords plenty of personalization through things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-use-and-customize-pixel-theme-packs">theme packs</a>, <em>Wicked: For Good</em> ones being the latest offering in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-owners-get-a-whole-host-of-new-features-with-the-november-pixel-drop">November 2025 Pixel Drop</a>. For gamers and multitaskers, there's a larger vapor chamber to keep the phone cool that Hicks says pays off in benchmarks. Also worth mentioning are safety features like car crash detection, emergency SOS, crisis alerts, VPN by Google, an auto-lock option if the phone is lost or stolen, and built-in anti-malware and anti-phishing features.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-google-pixel-9a-cameras-and-camera-performance-2">OnePlus 15R vs. Google Pixel 9a: Cameras and camera performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uwZ2aATG2DUJ64LSXaEZyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to taking photos, the phone cameras have similar feature sets. The OnePlus 15R has a 50MP primary camera sensor, the same as the OnePlus 15, along with a 32MP front camera with autofocus and an 8MP ultra-wide camera with a 112° field of view.  It's powered by the OnePlus DetailMax Engine and includes the same features as the OnePlus 15, including Ultra Clear Mode, Clear Burst, and Clear Night Engine. You can also shoot 4K videos at 120 fps.</p><p>Enjoy all the useful photo editing and fixing features you have come to know and love on OnePlus phones, including removing distracting objects, unblurring photos, and even removing reflections.</p><p>Jonnalagadda points out that the OnePlus 15R is missing a telephoto lens, a marked difference from the previous generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> that has a 50MP telephoto lens, making that phone arguably the better option in this department. Overall, he says the phone's cameras don't perform as well as the OnePlus 13R, with the exception of the great selfie camera. He finds the primary camera decent enough, but he can't get over the omission of a telephoto lens.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-camera-macro-focus" alt="The Google Pixel 9a camera viewfinder, with a close-up of a gnome thanks to the Macro Focus mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6dgg93SEBTUZKThvLeRQBk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, the Google Pixel 9a has a 48MP wide-angle primary camera, a 13MP front camera, and a 13MP ultrawide-angle camera. It's worth mentioning that it doesn't have a telephoto lens either, but it does have Super Res Zoom.</p><p>Google's photo editing features that leverage AI are where the real magic comes in. There are options like Add Me to add the photographer to a group photo so no one is left out of a shot, Best Take for combining the best expressions from a sequence of photos, and Magic Eraser, Unblur, and more.</p><p>One of the latest features is personalized edits in Google Photos, like removing sunglasses or hats and fixing smiles. But this is done through the Help me edit features in Google Photos, which you can access from other phones, too.</p><p>Hicks says the cameras capture vivid colors and decent detail in good lighting. But without optical zoom and with a smaller sensor that captures less light, it's not as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. That's to be expected since that device is much more expensive.</p><p>The Macro Focus mode, however, is stunning, activating by default as soon as you get up close to a subject. Image recognition also smartly focuses on the entire subject versus a tiny spot when in this mode. Overall, he says the phone's camera strength is with Macro Focus, and its weakness is with low-light photography and a lack of optical zoom.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-google-pixel-9a-which-should-you-choose-2">OnePlus 15R vs. Google Pixel 9a: Which should you choose?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HN3f8cmAQjM7kQTZYHicNf" name="Google-Pixel-9a-ai-wallpaper" alt="An AI-generated wallpaper on the Google Pixel 9a held in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HN3f8cmAQjM7kQTZYHicNf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're choosing between the OnePlus 15R and the Google Pixel 9a specifically, the answer is simple: go with the Google Pixel 9a. Jonnalagadda doesn't mince words when he calls the OnePlus 15R "bland and forgettable," adding that it "isn't worth your time or money." This isn't to say you should ignore OnePlus phones altogether.</p><p>If you're looking for a value option, the previous-generation OnePlus 13R is the better choice and offers tremendous bang for the buck. If you have a bit more dough to spare, upgrade to the OnePlus 15. But between these two devices, the better value is the Google Pixel 9a.</p><p>With that said, you may also want to wait for the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Google Pixel 10a</a>, though the Pixel 9a will still be a current phone for some time. It's a solid device that Hicks calls "the Energizer Pixel" and still ranks as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best budget Android phone</a>, with the OnePlus 13R a solid second choice. You'd be happy with either of these phones. When it comes to the OnePlus 15R, however, if you take the advice of Jonnalagadda, skip this one and go back a generation or spend a bit more for the OnePlus 15. It's a fantastic device worth the extra few hundred bucks.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5700c699-2d11-4f1d-b944-a70c9968b801">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ktg93UoYYjXreuE4PbAF3o.jpg' alt="An official product render of the OnePlus 15R"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15R</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Skip this one</strong></em></p><p>The OnePlus 15R isn't a bad phone, per se.

However, not everyone wants a flagship phone, and for those users, reliable options have long included Samsung's Fan Edition series, while Google's Pixel A-series and, more recently, OnePlus' R-series phones have offered strong value for money.</p><p>That said, the gap between flagship smartphones and these mid-range devices has been shrinking lately. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/no-limits-the-oneplus-15r-empowers-android-users-with-flagship-performance-huge-battery">newly launched OnePlus 15R</a> and Samsung Galaxy S25 FE both sit squarely in that space.</p><p>Both phones are priced below $799, typical of flagship phones, but they are also not quite as affordable as entry-level flagships. So, if you're looking for a premium mid-range smartphone, when comparing the OnePlus 15R vs. Galaxy S25 FE, which one is the better fit for you? Let's take a closer look at how they compare.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-pricing-and-availability-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DnWCsSVmfxgxfpLMfjBBYY" name="oneplus-15r-lockscreen-green-1" alt="A OnePlus 15R with a Flux Themes forest wallpaper on the lockscreen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DnWCsSVmfxgxfpLMfjBBYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While previous OnePlus R-series phones offered more affordable pricing, OnePlus has priced the 15R at a relatively steep $699 in the U.S. The base variant includes 256GB of onboard storage and 12GB of RAM, while upgrading to the 512GB variant costs an additional $100.</p><p>At the time of writing, the OnePlus 15R is currently available for pre-orders in the U.S. and UK, with open sales beginning on January 8, 2026. That said, the phone is already available for purchase in a few markets, including India.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R comes in two color options, Charcoal Black and Mint Breeze, while a third option, Electric Violet, is exclusive to the Indian market.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-color-should-you-buy">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</a> is priced lower than the OnePlus 15R, starting at $649, but that base variant includes only 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. The upside is that upgrading to the 256GB version costs just $50, bringing the price in line with the OnePlus 15R. The Galaxy S25 FE is available in four colors, including Icyblue, Jetblack, Navy, and White.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-design-and-build-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Design and build</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7tF3GgW37VhPfKZNvsHHSF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7tF3GgW37VhPfKZNvsHHSF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the past few years, Samsung's Galaxy Fan Edition phones have followed a fairly minimal design language, closely resembling the base and Plus models, and that is exactly what you get with the Galaxy S25 FE. It features a clean, minimalist design with a plain glass back, three vertically stacked camera sensors, and flat edges. One notable detail across all color options is the silver aluminum side rails.</p><p>On the OnePlus 15R, you also get a simple design, though with a slightly larger camera module than the S25 FE despite housing only two sensors. It features rounded corners, flat edges, and an aluminum alloy frame.</p><p>In terms of dimensions, the Galaxy S25 FE has a smaller footprint than the OnePlus 15R. Samsung has given the S25 FE a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>-like treatment by trimming down its thickness, which is quite noticeable.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT" name="OnePlus 15R" alt="OnePlus 15R review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DrbgwCR5LwkreLWBS9TfgT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy S25 FE measures 161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4mm, while the OnePlus 15R measures 163.4 x 77 x 8.3mm. There is also a clear weight difference, with the OnePlus 15R weighing significantly more than the Galaxy S25 FE at 219g versus 190g.</p><p>When it comes to durability, however, the OnePlus 15R pulls ahead. OnePlus claims the phone carries four IP ratings, including IP66, IP68, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a>, and IP69K.

The Galaxy S25 FE is no slouch either, with an IP68 rating that protects against water immersion for a limited time.</p><p>Up front, the OnePlus 15R offers a larger display than the Galaxy S25 FE. It features a 6.83-inch AMOLED panel with a refresh rate up to 165Hz and a peak brightness of 3,600 nits. That said, the glass used here is the slightly less robust Gorilla Glass 7i.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE comes with a more compact 6.7-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X display that supports up to 120Hz refresh rate. Its peak brightness tops out at 1,900 nits. Samsung does, however, use the more premium Gorilla Glass Victus Plus for display protection, which is similar to what we see on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship smartphones</a>.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-hardware-and-specs-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS" name="Samsung-S25-FE-official-images" alt="Samsung launches its budget new S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4578" height="2575" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest differences between flagship Galaxy smartphones and Fan Edition models has always been the chipset, and that remains true with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-buy-the-galaxy-s25-fe-or-go-for-the-regular-version">Galaxy S25 FE</a>. While the Galaxy S25 uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite, at least in the U.S., the Galaxy S25 FE relies on Samsung's own Exynos 2400 processor. It is capable enough for everyday use, but it is no match for flagship Qualcomm processors.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R, on the other hand, runs on Qualcomm's latest flagship-tier <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> chipset.

It supports up to 45W fast charging and also includes Qi2 15W wireless charging, something you do not get on the OnePlus 15R.</p><p>Of course, battery life varies by usage, but if I had to pick one blindly, the OnePlus 15R would be my choice.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning to software, both smartphones run custom versions of Android. The OnePlus 15R and Galaxy S25 FE ship with Android 16 out of the box, with the former running OxygenOS 16 and the latter running Samsung's One UI 8.</p><p>Both offer plenty of features and AI tools designed to make daily use easier, though Samsung's software suite is arguably among the best available on Android. Features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-might-look-like-circle-to-search-on-android-with-this-leaked-feature">Circle to Search</a>, object eraser in the Gallery app, and AI-assisted writing are available on both devices.</p><p>Where the Galaxy S25 FE clearly pulls ahead is long-term software support. Samsung promises up to seven major OS updates for the Galaxy S25 FE, compared to OnePlus' four years of major OS updates for the 15R. There are also additional Galaxy-only benefits, such as wireless Samsung DeX, which lets you turn your phone into a portable computing setup when paired with a monitor and mouse.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-cameras-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5rdejtR6KaGiswQ6FaeZZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Turning our attention to the cameras, the Galaxy S25 FE clearly pulls ahead. It ships with a 50MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and features like dual-pixel PDAF and optical image stabilization (OIS). This is paired with a 12MP ultra-wide sensor offering a 123-degree field of view, along with an 8MP telephoto sensor that supports up to 3x optical zoom.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R drops the telephoto camera altogether and includes only a 50MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor with a 112-degree field of view.</p><p>Because there is no dedicated telephoto lens, optical zoom is limited to a 2x crop from the primary sensor. As a result, images at higher zoom levels tend to look softer and more grainy from the OnePlus 15R.</p><p>For video, both phones support recording up to 4K at 120 fps, but the Galaxy S25 FE also offers 8K video at up to 30 fps. We have not yet tested the cameras side by side, but based purely on on-paper specifications, the Galaxy S25 FE appears to be the stronger option.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15r-vs-samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-which-should-you-buy-2">OnePlus 15R vs Samsung Galaxy S25 FE: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to choosing between the OnePlus 15R and the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it is quite clear that these two smartphones are built for very different types of users.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE is a solid choice for anyone looking for a balanced smartphone with a capable processor, a versatile camera setup, long-term software support, an excellent display, and a well-rounded battery and charging experience.</p><p>The OnePlus 15R, on the other hand, is a performance-focused device that may fall behind on cameras but delivers near-flagship performance along with class-leading battery life and charging.

This year finally saw the launch of the app’s long-awaited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/how-to-enable-spotify-lossless-audio">Lossless audio feature</a>, which significantly improves the quality of your music when you’re <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/how-to-enable-spotify-lossless-audio" target="_blank">listening through wired headphones</a> or via Wi-Fi with Spotify Connect. The best part is that it comes at no extra cost to Premium subscribers, despite rumors that it would be its own tier or cost extra.</p><p>Of course, Spotify also continues to update and add features, such as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-ai-dj-takes-requests-in-a-new-way-on-android-with-personal-prompts">AI DJ</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/spotify-jam-arrives-on-android-auto-via-an-update">Jam</a>, and a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotifys-prompted-playlists-lets-you-take-more-control-of-its-algorithm">Prompted Playlist</a> that lets users generate a playlist by describing the kind of music they want. Users can also bring DJ vibes to their playlists with Automix, which creates natural transitions between songs to keep the party going without pauses. Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-just-gave-free-users-a-major-upgrade-rolling-out-now">the most significant update for free users</a> came this year when Spotify finally gave them the ability to play and search for individual songs, bringing it a step closer to the premium tier and making it easier to enjoy and share tunes.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-video-streaming-service-netflix"><span>Best video streaming service: Netflix</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="emDQFv5mrjHW3yYWggx2QY" name="Netflix-splash-screen-tablet.jpg" alt="Netflix splash screen on a tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emDQFv5mrjHW3yYWggx2QY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>2025 was a weird year for streaming services.

We’re sure to see more battles between the big companies in 2026, but once the dust settles, don’t be surprised if Netflix is the last service standing.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-android-app-gemini"><span>Best Android app: Gemini</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V" name="Gemini-Live-Plants-3" alt="Using Gemini Live to grow plants and diagnose problems." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2u42Umpxe3p5YtqGi2Y93V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Artificial intelligence might be a very divisive and polarizing topic, but one thing’s for sure: it’s here to stay.

But reports from Korea say the company still hasn’t decided on the price.</p><p>A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202512231531467760101250" target="_blank">The Bell</a> says Samsung is having trouble setting prices for its new flagship phones — the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra — because the numbers aren’t working out (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-struggling-set-galaxy-s26-price/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The main issue is that making these phones has become much more expensive. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-increase-price-galaxy-s26-series">Several key parts are getting pricier at the same time</a>, including camera modules, OLED screens, and especially mobile DRAM (memory).</p><h2 id="hardware-costs-are-soaring-2">Hardware costs are soaring</h2><p>IDC <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/resource-center/blog/global-memory-shortage-crisis-market-analysis-and-the-potential-impact-on-the-smartphone-and-pc-markets-in-2026/" target="_blank">reports</a> that growing demand for AI data centers has made memory chips harder to get, which is raising prices for everyone. With higher costs, smaller profit margins, and global economic challenges, Samsung has to reconsider its pricing to avoid losing customers.</p><p>Samsung President Roh Tae-Moon is said to be asking suppliers to lower their prices, but there’s only so much they can do. The company is already selling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/poll-would-you-buy-samsung-galaxy-z-trifold">Galaxy Z TriFold</a> at a loss to show off its technology and gain market share. However, the Galaxy S series is Samsung’s main source of profit, so it can’t afford to lose money on millions of these phones just to keep prices low.</p><p>To deal with these costs, Samsung is using different processors in different models. The standard Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will likely use Samsung’s own Exynos 2600 chip in some regions. This helps the company avoid paying extra for Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips.</p><p>However, the Ultra model and, probably, the standard models in important markets like the U.S. will still use Qualcomm chips, and they don't come cheap. Since Samsung can’t stop using these pricier chips, it faces a tough decision: either accept lower profits or raise prices and risk selling fewer phones.</p><p>The official reveal is expected in February 2026. Until then, if you’re waiting for the S26, it’s a good idea to start saving some extra money now. You might need it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This update overhauls the interface and brings back the popular Photo Sphere experience (sort of), which was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/photo-sphere-returns-to-pixel-phones-but-not-the-pixel-8-series">removed from new devices starting with the Pixel 8</a> in 2023.</p><p>The update was released quietly with Pixel Camera version 10.2, which began rolling out in early December and is now on the Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/24/pixel-8-camera-new-panorama-mode/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). For Pixel 8 owners, this update offers a more intuitive, guided shooting experience with smoother stitches and better results, especially when used with Night Sight.</p><p>This updated panorama mode uses the Pixel's full HDR+ photo system to take individual high-quality frames and stitch them together. This method collects more image data, resulting in higher-quality images and improved dynamic range.</p><p>The interface is inspired by Photo Sphere and uses floating dots to guide you through the capture process. As you move your phone and line up each dot, a small preview appears above the viewfinder to show your progress.</p><p>The system also has a level indicator to help keep your shots straight, which is important for avoiding misalignments that can spoil a panorama.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.94%;"><img id="VnBmzstrSoC5422jgfFNmi" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VnBmzstrSoC5422jgfFNmi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="392" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:392px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:221.94%;"><img id="RQYVL9ENRp3pnQoWZ2DNmi" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RQYVL9ENRp3pnQoWZ2DNmi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="392" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:402px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.42%;"><img id="XEnFjesmd6fuFumrDBByji" name="Pixel-Camera-Panorama-mode" alt="Panorama mode in the Pixel 7's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XEnFjesmd6fuFumrDBByji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="402" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="shoot-any-direction-2">Shoot any direction</h2><p>A standout feature of this update is its flexible capture direction.

In panorama mode, you can set Night Sight to Off, Auto, or On, which allows you to take panoramic shots in low light. This feature could change how you photograph city skylines, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">starry nights</a>, or indoor architecture.</p><p>If you haven’t used panorama mode in a while, this update is a good reason to try it again.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has also managed to keep up on the software and AI fronts, which are becoming increasingly important as companies race to offer the best integration and most robust feature set.</p><p>As we look to 2026, how can OnePlus build on the momentum of two impressive flagship launches in one year? Here's what I expect and hope to see from OnePlus in the coming year.</p><h2 id="don-t-fall-behind-2">Don't fall behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi" name="Best of 2025" alt="OnePlus phone launches 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ub3Z5PNh3rVRbqffmuHpKi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-review">OnePlus 15</a> are among the most impressive we've seen from Android OEMs, with large batteries and fast charging speeds, and we'll likely see the latter model take the helm as OnePlus's focus throughout 2026. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-16">OnePlus 16</a> will likely launch toward the end of the year, and there are a few upgrades we hope to see that could make or break the phone for some consumers.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/which-google-pixel-10-model-should-you-buy">Pixel 10 series</a> sporting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">built-in Qi2 magnets</a>, we've come to appreciate the convenience of magnetic charging, including the various accessories you can pair with your phone. While we always recommend a smartphone case, it's also nice not to have to rely on one to use the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a>.</p><p>But perhaps the biggest change we'd love to see (aside from the return of the alert slider) is a better camera system. While the OnePlus 15 is impressive and technically better than the OnePlus 13, its sensors are inconsistent and fall behind the competition, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300</a>, making it tough for the company to compete in markets like Asia, where we often see some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">best smartphone cameras</a>.</p><h2 id="oneplus-should-bring-the-nord-series-back-to-the-u-s-2">OnePlus should bring the Nord series back to the U.S.</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EaxAUdEdRkv4LwUAVVPJi7" name="oneplus-nord-4-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus Nord 4 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EaxAUdEdRkv4LwUAVVPJi7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside the U.S., OnePlus offers a wide selection of models, including its flagships and more affordable Nord series. However, in the U.S., the company has only focused on its highest-end model and slightly cheaper R-series, opting for a dual phone launch strategy.</p><p>However, the price point makes OnePlus a bit hard to reach for many consumers. This is where the Nord series comes in; its absence has been felt, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget Android phones</a> seem to be dominated solely by Motorola and Samsung.</p><p>OnePlus has proven that it can make a compelling budget phone, but the absence of the Nord series in the U.S. in recent years has been a curious omission to me. After all, a good-looking phone like last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a>, with decent specs, a larger battery, and faster than a flagship like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> but at half the price, sounds like a phone many consumers would like to buy.</p><p>That sentiment also extends to OnePlus watches like the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/global/oneplus-watch-lite">OnePlus Watch Lite</a>. If OnePlus can bring a watch like this to the States, running Wear OS, I imagine it would be an instant hit at a time when smartwatch prices keep going up.</p><h2 id="oneplus-is-still-lacking-in-market-share-and-consumer-mindshare-2">OnePlus is still lacking in market share and consumer mindshare</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Sy52a53jgazSkxHv9A3msA" name="t-mobile-sign.jpg" alt="T-Mobile sign outside of store" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sy52a53jgazSkxHv9A3msA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Part of the problem with OnePlus only selling flagship phones is that they're beyond the reach of many consumers. But an even bigger problem OnePlus needs to address in 2026 is more or less the same one I was hoping it would overcome in 2025: its lack of carrier presence.</p><p>As capable of a company as OnePlus is, it still strikes me as odd that it no longer works with carriers in the U.S. to sell its phones. The U.S. is an important market, ruled mostly by carriers, and without presence in brick-and-mortar stores or even on their online storefronts, OnePlus continues to risk fading into irrelevance.</p><p>I would love to see OnePlus return to the U.S. in a big way that doesn't require well-informed consumers to visit a OnePlus website or Amazon. Having its phones available with carriers, rather than just supporting them, will help attract more eyes, which could ultimately lead to more sales.</p><p>It also makes it more appealing to consumers who may be deterred by the high price of a flagship phone, which OnePlus seems insistent on focusing its efforts on in the U.S. Buying through a carrier allows consumers to break up that high cost, which makes it easier to purchase expensive phones since you're not fronting the entire $899 at once.</p><p>That said, this would mean working with more than just one company. Carrier exclusives are mostly a thing of the past and severely limit the reach of an otherwise great phone. No one is switching carriers just to get their hands on a phone, so OnePlus needs to get all major U.S. carriers on board to get its phones in more consumer hands in 2026 and beyond.</p><h2 id="give-us-the-oneplus-open-2-2">Give us the OnePlus Open 2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvocrkJ9NQrCe4fwFr3Pq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As IDC points out, foldable phones are having their moment, especially as companies make them thinner and add more folds. However, the U.S. market is still quite small, with only three major players: Samsung and Google with book-style foldables, and Motorola with flip phones (alongside Samsung).</p><p>We've been hoping for a OnePlus Open 2 for some time, especially after the highly praised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a>. It would be the perfect time to return to the foldable space in 2026, and not just with a OnePlus Open 2, but also with a flip phone.</p><p>Oppo has proven that it can offer a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">thin and compelling foldable</a>, and I also loved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">its last flip phone</a>. Given their close relationship, it shouldn't be difficult for OnePlus to take another stab at the foldable market to show U.S. consumers what they've been missing out on.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Motorola launched one of the most impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a> we've ever seen, and even launched its own AI suite to compete with the likes of Google, Samsung, and others.</p><p>So, with 2026 right around the corner, there are still plenty of ways I would love to see Motorola improve, especially as Apple and Samsung continue to dominate while the Pixel grows in popularity.</p><p>So with that, here's what I expect and hope to see from Motorola in 2026.</p><h2 id="motorola-may-finally-expand-its-foldable-range-2">Motorola may finally expand its foldable range</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4064px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-series" alt="The Razr Ultra 2025 with the Razr Plus 2025 and Razr 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/koLWjXKCDwQYaL7Ksi9VWd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4064" height="2286" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Given the success of the Razr series and Motorola's growing market share, I fully expect the company to continue focusing on improving its lineup. In 2025, we saw the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/which-motorola-razr-2025-model-should-you-buy">expand the Razr lineup with three models</a>: the base, Plus, and Ultra models. It's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">similar strategy to Samsung's S series phones</a>, though Motorola's is slightly different: each model comes with significantly different specs to target different price points.</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2026">2026 Razr series</a>, I imagine Motorola will continue this three-phone strategy, although if it does, it should focus on price points and a better way to differentiate the Plus model. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-review">Razr Plus 2025</a> was essentially a relaunch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/one-year-with-the-motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> with minor adjustments and the same chipset, so it would be nice to see Motorola offer a true upgrade in 2026, perhaps with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-compared-the-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-to-the-snapdragon-8-elite-tensor-g5-and-dimensity-9500">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Razr Ultra 2026 should launch at a lower price while still offering premium specs, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>. Memory prices may make it difficult to lower prices, but Motorola has always done a good job of undercutting the competition. Plus, no matter how good its phones are, I believe Motorola isn't quite at the level it needs to be to demand consumers pay more for its phones than a comparable Galaxy phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY" name="motorola-ces-2026-fold-teaser-01" alt="Motorola sent us a teaser package that screams something exciting is brewing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HKfLwP689ohPYQrdz7QotY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On that note, Motorola recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorolas-ces-teaser-package-hints-at-a-moto-fold">teased a book-style foldable phone</a>, which could mean the company is finally ready to take the leap and challenge Samsung in other ways.

In fact, Motorola can take some of its good ideas and rework them for Gemini.</p><p>For instance, Motorola could give users the option to default to Gemini when using its AI Key, so they can easily call the AI from any screen without remapping the power button. Furthermore, Motorola could let users set Gemini as the AI of choice when using Look & Talk, giving it a unique edge over the Pixel.</p><p>This way, Motorola can still focus on improving other AI features across its UI while leveraging the AI with the most consumer mindshare. Samsung already uses Gemini to help sell its phones, and it would be in Motorola's best interest to do the same.</p> ]]></dc:content>

On the opposite end, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">Meta literally winged it with live demos</a> of their new smart glasses. While the demos didn't go as planned, they stayed fairly realistic, which is what we, as consumers who pay a hefty price for electronics, would appreciate seeing.</p><p>If tech companies want launch events to matter in 2026, they need to stop giving us Keynotes that could have been emails or overcomplicating them to the point where we lose interest. Instead, they need to offer more clarity and a better understanding of how an average person seeking to buy a new anything will perceive and use these products.</p><p>Here's what I'd love to see change in 2026 — and what's worth keeping.</p><h2 id="give-it-to-me-straight-in-plain-english-2">Give it to me straight — in plain English</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.10%;"><img id="kGztnVvmszZ677UWvKpnm6" name="made-by-google-2025-live-call-translate" alt="Jimmy Fallon demonstrating a call being live translated between English and Spanish" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kGztnVvmszZ677UWvKpnm6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Too often, companies end up explaining features the way they'd talk to engineers and not, well, us. We hear about "tokens per second," model sizes, or how "Siri now has a deeper understanding of your personal context."</p><p>There's a ton of technical jargon, and not much about how those things show up in the real world. Launch events need to answer questions when explaining a new feature — It comes down to the basics: "Why would I actually need it, when would I use it, and what problem would it solve?"</p><p>If I don't understand the practicality of a new feature and how it would help me in the real world, then what's the point of having some elaborate speech about it?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Take Google's Gemini, for instance: instead of telling me it's faster, smarter, and more "multimodal," tell me whether Gemini can look at a photo I took and explain why it looks bad and how to fix it before I share it. Even Samsung and Apple end up using loads of jargon in their Keynotes.</p><p>Apple loves to show off those emotionally hitting polished stories — the Apple Watch saving a life, the iPhone shooting a fancy music video (with tons of extra gear, post-production edits, of course). Samsung often bombards viewers with so many features so quickly, with little guidance on which actually matter.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HKphYoxGeRE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>But they skip the messy part: regular people trying to use that same tech and ending up with a terrible photo, bad lighting, or just a picture that looks nothing like the ad. In 2026, I want to see companies balance those magical tales with what these features actually look like for a totally average user. Because great stories definitely make people care, but great explanations push people to buy the product.</p><h2 id="keep-consumer-launches-and-developer-events-separate-2">Keep consumer launches and developer events separate</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="gaw5jJXMpSg8HE5A4v7vqi" name="google-io-ai-google-gemini-capabilities-visualized" alt="All of the Gemini capabilities announced at Google I/O 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:272,l:0,cw:2048,ch:1152,q:80/gaw5jJXMpSg8HE5A4v7vqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-biggest-announcements">Google's I/O </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/why-apple-ar-vr-isnt-ready">Apple's WWDC</a> keep developer updates separate from their launch events, but they sometimes blur the line between the two. For example, this year's I/O featured major product announcements, including the launch of Android 16, a demonstration of Gemini's multimodal capabilities, and a preview of a prototype of Google's XR glasses.</p><p>This mix at an event aimed just for developers is definitely cool. Google's probably trying to get more than just coders interested in I/O, but it's also leaving people confused about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-make-the-most-sense-out-of-google-io">whether they should be glued to I/O</a> or just watch the "Made by Google" for consumer-focused announcements. If you ask me, I'd say keep the two separate, don't overcomplicate it. That way, the audience knows what to expect at each event and won't miss anything of interest.</p><h2 id="keep-the-live-demos-even-if-they-fail-2">Keep the live demos — even if they fail</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KxKLpJ72BRc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Both Google and Meta actually tried live demos in 2025, and sometimes, despite practicing it a zillion times before D-day, they don't go as planned. WiFi dropped, or connectivity lagged, leading to awkward pauses during a live show.</p><p>But that necessarily isn't failure. While people pick on these moments to criticize the company, make a ton of memes, they can also work to the company's favor. It showed us the reality that mistakes happen — especially with common issues like connectivity problems, and this to me comes across as more authentic and raw, rather than scripted videos.</p><p>It also gives companies a real-world moment to look at what works and what still needs work before a product reaches consumers.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLkh1PDsOCM" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>So, for 2026, companies should totally keep the live demos. But they could try to swap out the celebrities for everyday people to make things more relevant for someone watching on their couch at home. You know, parents, students—those who don't care about the techy buzzwords but who will actually be using these cool new devices and features.</p><p>And just keep things simple, to the point, showing us how features will help normal people, rather than over-the-top shows with so much going on that people forget about it as soon as the show's over.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It truly made the biggest comeback last year, but now it’s time to show the world how it really is the best Android manufacturer.</p><h2 id="focus-on-hardware-and-focus-the-hardware-2">Focus on hardware, and focus the hardware</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the company had some of the best launches in 2025, I still think it struggled with being organized.</p><p>Launching the S25 Edge was purely to compete with Apple, but no one wants a thin phone that compromises performance. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-developing-galaxy-s26-after-all">Reports surfaced that due to poor sales</a>, the company began reducing production and started heavily discounting the phone.</p><p>And now<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch"> </a>reports indicate that the company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">scrapped plans for the S26 Edge</a>, and a senior Samsung executive reportedly told a South Korean publication that the company wasn’t “sure if the slim line will ever return, but as of now, it seems unlikely. It’s practically gone.”</p><p>I think in 2026, Samsung needs to focus on keeping a tight lineup of phones it knows will deliver the same success it saw in 2025. Launching its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26-your-ultimate-guide">flagship S26 lineup</a>, followed by the company’s next generation of foldables (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-8">Galaxy Z Flip 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-8">Z Fold 8</a>), and its more affordable A-series, should be the standard.</p><p>But even with this standard lineup of phones, we’re seeing reports that Samsung might only stick with the Galaxy S26 base, Plus, and Ultra models, dropping the edge variant and removing the “Pro” label for the base to keep the lineup traditional.</p><p>This move seems to make sense because if it were to launch the base model with a “Pro” suffix, it would have to bring Pro-level features to the phone. However, it still seems like the company is confusing customers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TPhgdjHuiV5oyJGf2y2f7J" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-FE-review-Android-Central-24" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black in flex mode on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPhgdjHuiV5oyJGf2y2f7J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I think back to other random models launched last year, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</a>.

But what you don’t realize is that these are the products that add flavor to our personality.</p><p>While I go back and forth between using a case and not, this year, I learned about a bunch of phone case brands that really are trying to redefine what a traditional phone case looks like. From sturdy materials to exciting new designs, we are so excited to share this years winners!</p><p>Senior editor Namerah Saud Fatmi, and Android Central contributors Brady Snyder and Tshaka Armstrong, have taken the time tell us why some of the brands we love so much are our winners!</p><p>Read on to find out the winners for best phone case manufacturer, best wireless headphones, and best wireless earbuds!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-phone-case-brand-spigen"><span>Best phone case brand: Spigen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4150px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="vxbESRX558xYaqSXNXkGW7" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-04" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K on the Galaxy S25 Plus with a Qi2 magnetic case from Spigen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vxbESRX558xYaqSXNXkGW7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4150" height="2334" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spigen won the votes for the best phone case manufacturer this year, which shocked no one. The brand offers some of the most affordable cases for the best smartphones, and it's very consistent in what it puts out. If you have no idea what phone case to buy, you can't go wrong with anything from Spigen.</p><p>The brand’s lineup is also pretty versatile, with clear cases, magnetic options, rugged numbers, and a growing number of smartwatch accessories and add-ons such as phone holders and wallets. Spigen absorbed its sister brand Caseology in January 2025, further solidifying the brand’s image as a case maker with a little something for everyone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="paqpnzHePGeMGKax2ZrNEn" name="OnePlus-15-Thinborne-case-inside" alt="The Thinborne case for the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/paqpnzHePGeMGKax2ZrNEn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Runner-up:</strong> Thinborne</p><p>As for the runner up, Thinborne came in second place this year. Although this Texas-grown case manufacturer prices its creations pretty steeply, the quality is undoubtedly premium. If you need an impossibly thin case that can take a beating and still manages to include a magnetic ring inside, Thinborne has what you're looking for. Almost every phone case from the brand is priced over $60, but I promise you, this small business does not play around. It is absolutely worth the splurge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="i6RAnGe2ZohPsZPMVBjMxE" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-9" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i6RAnGe2ZohPsZPMVBjMxE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> BURGA</p><p>It's unusual for me to mention a third option when talking about the best case makers of the year, but I feel like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/is-burga-the-new-casetify">not mentioning BURGA</a> would be a crime. This Lithuanian brand has put itself on the radar and has offerings comparable to well-respected players in the industry, such as CASETiFY. The designs that BURGA offers are so unique and fun, and every product has a personality. It's a brand with a soul, and even if it didn't get the votes, I say it's up there with the very best phone case makers of 2025.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-headphones-sony-wh-1000xm6"><span>Best wireless headphones: Sony WH-1000XM6</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WddBZaxVsF7ssdhPHXuSmA" name="Sony-WH1000XM6-vs-Sonos-Ace-5" alt="The Sonos Ace in white beside the Sony WH-1000XM6 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WddBZaxVsF7ssdhPHXuSmA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In 2025, Sony showed us that they listen to consumer feedback, Bose stayed on Sony’s neck in the battle for ANC supremacy, Nothing brought their “A” game with the striking design of the Headphone 1, and brands like Sennheiser, Bowers & Wilkins, and Noble Audio brought hardware with flagship-killing sound to market.</p><p>Despite all of that, it may come as no surprise that our winner for best wireless headphones is Sony’s latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">WH-1000XM6</a>, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen)</a> being our runner-up. Some of the headphones mentioned above may sound better, but none implement ANC quite as effectively as Sony and Bose.</p><p>Between the two, Sony edges out Bose very slightly due to its slightly better handling of high-frequency noise cancellation, and some listeners prefer its app’s much deeper customization options to Bose’s more minimalist offering. Sound is all about preference, though: Sony is more neutral, while Bose is warmer in the bass and sub-bass frequencies. Both are excellent choices and have been market leaders in wireless ANC headphones for years, so it really boils down to preference. There’s no bad choice here!</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-wireless-earbuds-airpods-pro-3"><span>Best wireless earbuds: AirPods Pro 3</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo" name="Apple-AirPods-Pro-3-review-3" alt="The AirPods Pro 3 with their charging case at a park." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8WDxM8sZjKayJLvuEtz3Lo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was an excellent year for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, with new models from Apple, Bose, Beats, Samsung, and Google leading the charge. Out of all of the options, Android Central’s top pick is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/airpods-pro-3-review">AirPods Pro 3</a>. They’re affordable (we’ve already seen AirPods Pro 2 discounted to less than $200) while adding improved ANC and a new design.</p><p>Even if you live outside the Apple ecosystem, it’s hard to ignore the excellence of the AirPods Pro 3. The ear tips use a hybrid foam-and-silicone design for better fit and sound isolation, while the earbuds themselves feature new vents for airflow and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/airpods-pro-3-feature-want-google-samsung-to-copy">built-in heart rate monitor</a>.</p><p>Apple’s bold claim for the AirPods Pro 3 is that they pack “the world’s best ANC of any in-ear wireless headphones,” and you know what? It’s probably true. If they fit right and you find them comfortable, the AirPods Pro 3 offer the strongest active noise cancellation of any earbuds I’ve tested.</p><p>However, the fit still isn’t perfect for everyone, despite Apple switching things up here. If you’re looking for alternatives, our honorable mentions go to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-gen-2-earbuds-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2 earbuds</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><h2 id="best-charging-power-bank-manufacturer-anker-2">Best charging/power bank manufacturer: Anker</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="mTGEsqeqfqqUGVr4KjxYdJ" name="Anker-Black-Myth-Wukong-Limited-Edition-Prime-Docking-Station-3" alt="The Anker x Black Myth: Wukong Edition Prime Docking Station" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mTGEsqeqfqqUGVr4KjxYdJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anker was near-unanimously ranked as the go-to brand for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">chargers and power banks</a> in 2025. It's so hard to pick a single great option to recommend, though, because the company has that many products. Some cult favorites include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/anker-nano-power-bank-a1638-hands-on">Anker Nano</a> lineup of chargers and the Anker Prime GaN power banks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/anker-nano-power-bank-5k-maggo-slim-hands-on">available in various sizes</a>.</p><p>While not the most budget-friendly, Anker’s charging tech is dependable and frequently goes on sale throughout the year. Anker's chargers and power banks are heat-efficient, intelligent, powerful, and compact. All you have to do is look at their portfolio, pick something based on your needs, and you can trust whatever you pick to serve you well for a good few years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3709px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL" name="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" alt="INIU Pocket Rocket P50 Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUaSdew48BxqcdGb52aVGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3709" height="2086" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Honorable mention:</strong> INIU</p><p>If you are looking for an alternative, INIU is a fantastic underdog in the game. Far too many people have been sleeping on the brand and its superb offerings. I highly recommend picking something from INIU for your next power bank.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/warning-dont-buy-this-power-bank-unless-you-want-your-friends-and-family-to-steal-it">INIU Pocket Rocket P50</a> impressed me so much that it's still sitting in my purse as I type this. I take it literally everywhere I go. Having access to 45W charging, a tiny USB-C charging cable, and 10,000mAh to top off my Pixel 10 Pro twice in such a cute little form factor is a <em>dream</em>. After Anker, INIU deserves the crown as the best power bank creator of the year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A new year means new stuff, new features for the stuff we already have, and new companies doing new things. 2026 will give us all of this, but maybe a bit differently than we're accustomed to or expect.</p><p>The tech market depends on more than just good ideas and fast chips — the economy is a driving factor, and that will dictate what we see in the coming year. Combined with supply constraints, I expect all manufacturers to sell fewer products in 2026 than in 2025. Here's why.</p><h2 id="ai-will-never-die-2">AI will never die</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-keynote-AI-everywhere" alt="Cristiano Amon on stage with "AI everywhere" behind him" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4Q8xJWPsVq4ErZUgk9b5P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2900" height="1631" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing that isn't going to change is the breakneck pace of companies racing to outdo each other and "corner" the AI market. It's extremely expensive to keep rolling out the infrastructure, but it's equally lucrative. For every million spent, more than a million comes back.</p><p>Some of it will be beneficial; expect breakthroughs in medicine and healthcare, or even ways to farm the food we eat more efficiently. Some will be terrifying: laser guidance weaponry with AI targeting and all the science fiction you can think of.</p><p>Some may actually be helpful for us. As tech companies keep trying to make AI into a helpful addition to our daily routine, they bang out a few hits along with the misses. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic AI</a>, where your electric buddy tries to help you without asking for it, is going to be a big deal, and you expect to see your next smartphone filled to the gills with it.</p><h2 id="prices-will-skyrocket-until-someone-figures-it-out-2">Prices will skyrocket until someone figures it out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1740px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="hMeAmXcAiwjSQBFuuUKdmL" name="Tab-S11-Ultra-price" alt="Samsung Galaxy S11 Tab Ultra checkout screenshot." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hMeAmXcAiwjSQBFuuUKdmL.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1740" height="979" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Due to the high demand for AI and component manufacturers' limited capacity to meet it, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more" target="_blank">prices of your gadgets will continue to rise</a>, with "cheap" gear being affected the most.</p><p>We'll see plenty of incentives trying to justify it all, like free accessories or free access to otherwise paid services, but that doesn't address the unsolvable issue of supply and demand.</p><p>Eventually, I think by mid-year, some company will find a way to tame the price problem. I can see a company with access to cheap labor finding a way to build the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-400">$400 flagship-level phone</a> again when the Apples and Samsungs of the world want well over a thousand.

Packing it full of features, both the existing ones we love to use and all the new ones they love to tell us about, is one way to do it.</p><p>Unfortunately, another approach is to exclude those features from products with lower profit margins. We already see this on some level; the new features of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> would be fine running on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-one-year-later">Pixel 9</a>, but Google wants you to spend $999, so it holds them back. Apple and Samsung do the same.</p><p>In 2025, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget-friendly phone</a> may lack some things the previous model had to entice you to spend more and to save the company, making it a few pennies per unit by not including them. It all sounds petty until you translate those few pennies into 40 million units.</p><h2 id="showcase-phones-will-still-be-awesome-2">Showcase phones will still be awesome</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zovSVbyXAdz2NhWh7aSEDW" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-galaxy-z-fold-7-magic-v5-oppo-find-n5-hinges-4" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold, Honor Magic V5, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5 intertwined hinges" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zovSVbyXAdz2NhWh7aSEDW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung, for example, will never stop making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">Galaxy S Ultra</a>. It's their pride and joy, showcasing what the company is capable of in one sleek, beautiful package. I'm not a fan of everything Samsung does, but as a phone nerd, I love the company's Galaxy S Ultra because it does it all. Others feel the same way about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone Pro Max</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-early-impressions">Pixel Pro XL</a>. They go beyond the flagship and are a true showcase.</p><p>Ditto for foldables. Samsung will never stop making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold</a>, nor will it stop trying to pack even more into it. Motorola, Google, and all the rest are the same. 2026 may even be the year Apple gives its customers what they want in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a>.</p><p>This can't change because enthusiasts will gather torches and pitchforks if it does. The issue ties back to the cost. It will cost even more to add more and build these uberphones, so the manufacturer is forced to charge more.</p><p>Fewer people will buy them, but those who do will love using them.</p><h2 id="it-won-t-be-a-tech-apocalypse-2">It won't be a tech apocalypse</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aaRbRz73sMPJYQf2FzgAUe" name="apocalypse-now-redux.jpg" alt="Apocalypse Now Redux" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aaRbRz73sMPJYQf2FzgAUe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Miramax Films)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A lot of this sounds like gloom and doom, but really, it's not. Some executives will see a bit less of a bonus, and not as many dollars will end up in corporate accounts, but it will mostly be business as usual, both good and bad. We already see this, and for every great new startup, there is a mass layoff somewhere else.</p><p>Companies have planned for times like this, and while we may see one or two pull out of the consumer market, most will stay the course.</p><p>We should stay the course as well and accept that sometimes there will be an off year. Maybe you don't buy a new gadget in 2026 because they can't stay in stock, or you can't/won't spend more on one. That's not a big issue — get ready to do it in 2027!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The laptop clocks in at just under three pounds with 11.8mm of thickness, but you still get a gorgeous 15.6-inch AMOLED display and a ton of ports along the side, including HDMI, dual USB-C, and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot. </p><p>The Galaxy Chromebook Plus is just as impressive under the hood, with 8GB of RAM, an efficient Intel Core 3 100U CPU, and up to 13 hours of battery life on a single charge. The laptop also comes with a few useful features that you might not expect, such as a backlit keyboard and Samsung's handy Quick Insert key. As I mentioned above, buying the device from Best Buy also lands you 12 months of the Google One AI Premium plan, which means you get to enjoy all of the latest Google AI software features alongside 2TB of free cloud storage. </p><p>The only real problem with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-laptops">Samsung laptop</a> is that you're limited to 256GB of storage, plus you're missing out on a few modern features that you may want, such as a touchscreen display and a fingerprint scanner. Whether that's a dealbreaker or not is up to you, but for most folks, this is a Chromebook deal that's worthy of some serious consideration. </p> ]]></dc:content>
