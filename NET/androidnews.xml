The company states that its updated plan reflects its new "approach" to "preserve actively used links" created via its URL Shortener. If you or your company uses a shortened link through Google's creator, the company advises checking it as soon as possible.</p><p>If you're link is consistently used, the post states you should be sent to that link's destination without a warning message.</p><p>Google states users were vocal, reporting that their shortened links have been used in documents, videos, and other forms of media to connect their users. Hopefully, this brings the people who use them some peace of mind.</p><p>However, if you receive a "This link will no longer work in the near future" message, Google recommends finding a new URL shortener. The company explains that URLs most likely to display this message are those that "showed no activity in late 2024."</p><p>Links with this message will cease to function on Google's previously set August 25, 2025 date.</p><h2 id="the-full-shutdown-is-nearly-here-2">The full Shutdown is nearly here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z" name="chrome-app-icon-android" alt="Google Chrome for Android app icon on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over a year ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-discontinues-support-for-links-created-via-url-shortener">Google announced</a> that it would soon begin cutting off links created through its URL Shortener. This announcement came some time after Google had already removed the ability for new link creation. Last August, the company started displaying the "This link will no longer work in the near future" message for links that weren't actively in use. This, of course, informed users that its URL Shortener was shutting down officially on August 25, 2025.</p><p>Google was also aware that its warning message would likely disrupt the user experience, stating it could "prevent the redirect flow from completing correctly."</p><p>The company also stated last year that it would begin increasing the appearance rate of this warning message from late 2024 to 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication's insight claims to have narrowed down the camera situation for the S25 FE. Supposedly, the device will feature a triple camera array again with a 50MP main sensor, 12MP ultrawide, and an 8MP telephoto. The selfie camera is reported as a 12MP lens with an f/2.2 aperture.</p><p>The internal information sheds light on the device's potential <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Exynos 2400</a>, which is a two-year-old chip by this point. However, these rumors paint a small downgrade for the S25 FE, stating it might give consumers a lower 4,500mAh capacity battery, instead of the same 4,900mAh capacity battery like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">the S24 FE</a>.</p><p>Rumors purport Samsung will debut the S25 FE with two RAM/storage variations of 8/128GB and 8/256GB. One UI 8 (Android 16) is expected out of the box, and this is an interesting point, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-one-ui-8-beta-4-bug-fixes-patch-notes">Samsung just dropped Beta 4</a>. Hopefully, this signals testing is wrapping up soon.</p><p>The post reiterates some older rumors, such as the phone's probable 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED display and its thin 7.4mm measurement.</p><h2 id="this-could-be-next-2">This could be next</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-2" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9tt5ywyBytBzTTSuhuzeF8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There was a leak from early July that reported the Galaxy S25 FE's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">appearance at the WPC</a> for wireless charging certification. This report saw the device pick up the WPC's Qi2 wireless certification; however, the publication's rumors claim this will sit at 15W charging strength. This is a number that's in line with the rest of the S25 series. It's also worth pointing out that Samsung's S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">requires a case to take advantage</a> of its wireless charging.</p><p>That WPC leak also showcased the device in a real-life photo. The device seemed to sport relatively thin bezels, but it notably lacked the black rings around its triple camera array. The flagship S25 series picked that up, which mirrored the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Most recent developments not only saw the Fold 7 opt for silver rings, but it seems the S25 FE could do the same.</p><p>A potential launch is still up in the air, but rumors say the Galaxy S25 FE could join the Galaxy Tab S11 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">in September</a>. A Samsung exec commented on the tablet series after Unpacked, stating consumers could see the duo "shortly" after, which led speculation in the direction of September, like the Tab S10 in 2024.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The fight then included Samsung as big tech companies started incorporating anti-competitive features, such as the Korean OEM's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">Auto Block</a>" feature, which reportedly heavily deterred users from third parties.</p><p>This was essentially wrapped in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epics-free-games-program-is-coming-to-the-epic-games-store-on-android">the sideloading policies</a> companies enforced on their systems. Earlier this year, Epic made a statement, saying, "So far none of the 100 highest grossing mobile game developers are willing to distribute their games on the Epic Games Store because of the Core Technology Fee and Apple and Google’s onerous restrictions and scare screens." Alongside these scare tactics, users attempting to sideload—take the Epic Game Store, for instance—are met with a series of system prompts.</p><p>These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-harder-to-sideload-apps-on-android">prompts are often lengthy</a>, forcing users to go through upwards of 12 to 15 steps just to install the Epic Game Store. Following the Ninth Circuit's ruling and the store's availability within the Play Store, this should be much simpler for users.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But the opposite is usually the case, and that includes the Galaxy Z Fold 7.

With each of these, you're presented with a variety of options, but I recommend selecting the <strong>.5x</strong> scale, as it speeds up animations but isn't as drastic as turning them off entirely.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-good-lock"><span>Good Lock</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="TeRUiPazNeHFtLiZNp4Rtd" name="good-lock-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" alt="Good Lock on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TeRUiPazNeHFtLiZNp4Rtd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4660" height="2621" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Did you know that you can customize even more with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and One UI 8 than what you'll find in the Settings app?

You might let someone share your phone once in a while, but chances are it's yours alone and chock full of important information that you need to keep at hand. Since a lot of other people would love to have access to that information, too, keeping it for your eyes only is critical.</p><p>You might think you have nothing worth any sort of protection. A lot of people think that way, but it's simply not true. You've probably seen those late-night commercials about identity theft because it happens to all types of people; you don't have to be rich for someone to try to get a loan in your name. Besides that, you probably have other things you'd like to keep a little private. Medical information, financial information, that sort of stuff.</p><p>This is why Google's latest effort for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-chrome-autofill-a-little-less-risky-on-android">password protection on Chrome</a> will go a long way.</p><h2 id="keep-the-important-stuff-secure-2">Keep the important stuff secure</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7jsJtrk8uSt8Yv9sfM4cLm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-display-fingerprint-sensor-02.jpg" alt="An up-close look at the new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jsJtrk8uSt8Yv9sfM4cLm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The sad reality is that it's super easy to get to all this when your phone is in my hands. It doesn't have to be; you can set things up so your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/pixel-phones-are-having-a-fit-with-their-lock-screens-thanks-to-android-16">phone is locked every time the screen goes off</a>, but there are all sorts of ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/smart-lock">make things more convenient</a>, thus keeping everything up, running, and ready for anyone to see. Most people choose the convenient way because they interact with their phone hundreds (thousands?) of times per day.</p><p>The trick is finding a way to keep things easy to use while protecting some stuff from others. Google <em>finally</em> got the message with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-a-google-password-manager-shortcut-to-your-home-screen">Chrome Password manager</a>, and soon it will require you to use your fingerprint or another way to authenticate who you are before it automatically offers to fill in passwords. It's a little late, but better than never.</p><p>We need more of this. And no, things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">locked folders</a> that you have to set up in advance aren't the way to do it. Your fingertip is.</p><p>To be honest, I'm torn on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-might-have-faster-fingerprint-unlocks-with-one-ui-7-beta">using your fingerprint as a password</a>. To me, your fingerprint is who you are, and more like a username that you can never change. But my unpopular opinion doesn't matter because it's a bajillion times easier than entering a password on a tiny keyboard. Since it's become the norm, though, it's time to use it for anything and everything that's remotely important.</p><h2 id="more-options-are-better-2">More options are better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-01.jpg" alt="Apps on the Motorola Razr 2024 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h2oNLkGAXdqmXnmCCkZs7W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's say, for example, you use Google Photos. The app comes with a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">Locked Folder</a>" feature, but requires you to set it before you use it. It's great that it's there, and I'm not saying that they should remove it in favor of something global, just that a lot of people don't even know about it or will never bother.</p><p>What if, instead, when you first used the app, it gave you the option to require your fingerprint to see your photos and instead offered a public folder that anyone can see? If you don't care, just say no. If you do care, it only takes a second to press on the screen or the <em>much</em> better side button some phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Moto Razr</a> use.</p><p>Now apply this logic to everything.</p><p>This is a platform-level task, and while phone makers like Samsung could implement it (Samsung was early to the party with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-samsungs-secure-folder-galaxy-s8">secured folders and storage spaces</a>), this needs to come from Google and Apple. A "simple" layer that sits in between the OS and an app can handle all of it, so we won't have to depend on app developers for any of it.</p><p>I know this is wishful thinking on my part, and if anything resembling this happens, it will be in a distant future, but it's still something I'd like to see. Options are good and we love them, provided they're presented well. One more can't hurt, right?</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Edge has a really comfortable, thin design, with an anti-slip vegan leather backing that's easy to hold and looks downright classy.</p><p>It's also well-liked for its camera suite, long battery life, and fast charging. It's also worth noting that this particular deal is for the 256GB storage option in the Pantone Deep Forest color.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2025-256gb-unlocked-pantone-deep-forest/6624976.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HGSNsz96xFxi7JgSBj43z3" name="motorola edge 2025 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HGSNsz96xFxi7JgSBj43z3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Edge 2025 (256GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2025-256gb-unlocked-pantone-deep-forest/6624976.p" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$549.99</del> <strong>$449.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy's <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/best-buy-back-to-school-deals-2025">2025 Back-to-School sale</a> brings with it a $100 discount on the latest-gen Motorola Edge, which is our favorite Motorola phone overall. From its nice, thin design and vegan leather backing to its cameras and battery life, it's a pretty solid phone that's arguably a little overpriced when it's not on sale.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/motorola-edge-2025-256gb-unlocked-pantone-deep-forest/6624976.p" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$549.99" data-dimension48="$549.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a good deal on a versatile, midrange smartphone; battery life is an important selling point for you; having a range of different camera options for good photos and videos is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you prefer to have a phone offering several OS updates; you'd prefer to go with a phone that offers industry-leading performance and little to no lag.</p><p>The Motorola Edge (2025) is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">best Motorola phone</a> out there, but it's worth waiting for sales like this due to its price tag. With that being said, the Edge includes a nice 6.7-inch pOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, 8GB of RAM, and Android 15 OS. It also has three rear cameras, including a telephoto, ultrawide, and a regular PDAF lens, as well as a front PDAF lens. The 5,200mAh battery offers pretty excellent battery life, and the Edge also has 68W fast charging.</p><p>It's also worth pointing out that this phone only comes with two OS updates, so if that's a dealbreaker for you, it may be worth looking elsewhere.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Especially when you take into consideration that the KONKR Pocket FIT is using the Qualcomm's latest flagship gaming chip, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4111px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="CabSrRfCEqPKiY9L8U4dL5" name="konkr-pocket-fit-specs-overview" alt="KONKR Pocket FIT Specs Overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CabSrRfCEqPKiY9L8U4dL5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4111" height="2311" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: KONKR / AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic</a> were released, priced at either $179/$229 or $119/$129, respectively.

Well, that's not the case as both the Pocket S2 and Pocket FIT are equipped with LCD displays.

The most recent rumor gives us official looking renders of the budget Pixel Buds, in the Iris colorway, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a. </a></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-buds-2a">Android Headlines</a> also notes that these buds could be a follow up to the original Pixel Buds A -Series. Reliable leaker Arsène Lupin posted some<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MysteryLupin/status/1940848330839654705" target="_blank"> details on X</a>, and they suggest that Google may be mixing things up with Pixel Buds' 2a colors.  As it these Buds may also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/pixel-buds-2a-colors-might-not-look-anything-like-the-ones-weve-seen-before">show up three other colors:</a> Strawberry, Fog Light, and Hazel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6" name="Pixel-Buds-2a" alt="Pixel Buds 2a -Iris" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwXMrQQwYcf57vPZwFZbn6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the renders show the Pixel Buds 2a inside the signature oval case, however it looks like the insides of the case could also get a splash of color to match the Buds placed in them. If you look closer at the renders,  you can notice that they have new microphone cutouts, suggesting that Google could finally bring ANC to these buds, a step up from its predecessor.</p><p>In terms of design, the renders show that these buds will stick to its predecessors' overall look, showcasing in-ear rounded buds, without a steam, placed in an oval charging case. However, Google could make some minor changes to its design so that it better fits the user's ear.</p><p>As for the Pixel Buds 2a's battery life, the website notes that it could get a boost when compared to the original budget earbuds, and it might also come with enhanced sound quality. While there's not much information on pricing, Google might sell these new earbuds in line with its budget offering, but since it could have ANC, and other new features, they might slightly up the price a bit.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">pic.twitter.com/oJv38zaVFL<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1950291439570583746">July 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The Pixel Buds 2a aren't the only earbuds that could show up at this year's Made by Google.

However, the wait isn't for much long as Google is set to reveal its next flagship series on August 20, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">we expect that the Pixel Buds 2a and Buds 2 Pro</a> could be revealed during the same event.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This exact line was delivered nearly verbatim in both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/metas-q2-earnings-continue-to-soar-as-ai-fuels-its-ad-revenue">Q2 2025 earnings</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-q1-2025-earnings-show-major-ai-priority-shift-ray-ban-success">Q1 2025 earnings</a> calls, and it likely cements a shift in consumer interest that we've been seeing since Meta revamped the Quest Store last Summer.</p><p>From what we know, the next 6-12 months are going to be huge for Meta's Reality Labs division. We're expecting another pair of Oakley Meta smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-smart-glasses-teaser">based on the Sphaera style</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">third generation of Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses</a>, and the company's first pair of commercially available smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-next-gen-ray-ban-hypernova-glasses-semg-bracelet-render-leaks">with a screen in the lenses</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Quest 4 has been reportedly "canceled" in favor of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-quest-4-might-slip-to-2027-but-meta-could-unveil-a-lighter-model-next-year-instead">a radical new design</a> that is supposed to look a lot more like goggles than a traditional VR headset. Since we don't expect this Quest until at least the end of 2026, all hopes are riding on smart glasses to continue to push Meta's XR hardware revenue toward continually better places, especially when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>'s launch is right around the corner.</p><h2 id="things-aren-t-going-as-planned-2">Things aren't going as planned</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQv5XxMxUoFaFuJssqTaSk" name="meta-quest-3-controller-playing" alt="Holding a Meta Quest 3 controller while playing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQv5XxMxUoFaFuJssqTaSk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's clear that Meta's Quest ambitions aren't going as planned. While the Quest 2 was a dramatic entry into the market <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-2-units-sold-spring-2022">that outsold the Xbox</a>, the Quest 3 line hasn't seen the same level of success. We don't know what the exact sales numbers are for the Quest 3, but many Quest 3 exclusive games have lower player counts than their Quest 2-compatible counterparts, and Meta's admission of lower-than-expected sales also helps reveal that reality.</p><p>The company revamped the Quest store (now called the Horizon Store since it'll eventually be available on non-Quest-branded VR headsets) last Summer, allowing indies to jump straight to the main listings instead of being kept in the App Lab section. Meta has also been more transparent with developers this year, offering up important insights like how to develop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/optimize-user-time-goldilocks-session-length-meta-quest/">for the "Goldilocks" session time</a> and suggestions <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">to push for free-to-play content</a>.</p><p>All of this shows that Meta's initial push for big, long AAA-quality games like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/asgards-wrath-2-review">Asgard's Wrath 2</a> didn't pan out, but similar titles with big names like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a> and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Deadpool VR</a> show more promise. Plus, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition">hardware partnership with Xbox</a> has driven a lot of eyes to the Quest brand among gamers, with the Xbox Meta Quest 3S selling out at Meta's website in a matter of days.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="omh5CKpghxiJEViVQUnMUM" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-render-bundle-01" alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/omh5CKpghxiJEViVQUnMUM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, maybe more importantly to the company's current goals, AI glasses have proven to be a hit with consumers. As of February 2025, Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">sold over 2 million Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> and has ramped up production to sell 10 million a year. Considering these glasses sell for as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Meta Quest 3S</a>, on average, and cost a lot less to manufacture, there's reason for Meta and its investors to get excited about 2025.</p><p>The recently released Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">substantially improved image stabilization</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">better battery life</a>, and we're expecting even more improvements from the rest of Meta's fall 2025 smart glasses lineup. The company just invested another $3.5 billion into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/meta-takes-around-3-stake-ray-ban-parent-essilorluxottica-source-says-2025-07-08/">EssilorLuxottica</a>, the parent company behind Ray-Ban and Oakley, with plans to invest even more as both companies release more smart glasses.</p><p>But while AI glasses have taken off, I don't believe for a minute that Meta expected to have such success. Meta AI wasn't ready for the initial October 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> launch and didn't even publicly launch until April 2024. At that point, it felt like the product transformed into something completely different, and the sales reflected that over the course of 2024.</p><h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here-2">Where do we go from here?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="C3p87vPFtdpqnkvCohggH7" name="meta-vr-glasses-prototype-2025" alt="An ultra-thin VR headset prototype Meta developed in cooperation with an associate professor at Stanford and a Stanford PhD student" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C3p87vPFtdpqnkvCohggH7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta / Nature Photonics)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the years, a common complaint about VR headsets is that they're too big, too heavy, and too "dorky looking," for lack of a nicer term. While many people have no problem wearing a VR headset, there's still a social stigma that comes with having something that large on your head.</p><p>So Meta has pushed to make its VR headsets look more like glasses, and several new prototypes (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-stanford-synthetic-aperture-waveguide-holography-vr-glasses-research/">via UploadVR</a>) give us an idea of what to expect. Something like what you see above is what Meta spends a whole lot of money every quarter developing, and while it's still several years away, the company's investment in the AR/VR industry is helping it deliver commercially available products ahead of the competition.</p><p>Even if this particular vision of a standalone glasses-like form factor is still several years out, the current crop of rumors points to the Meta Quest 4 looking more like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> smart glasses than the current Quest headset design. That seems like a far better way to deliver mixed reality and virtual reality gaming to consumers who don't like traditional VR headset designs and is a real sign of things to come.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B" name="meta-ray-ban-smart-glasses-hypernova-mockup" alt="A mockup of what Meta Hypernova smart glasses could look like using transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jriGiXXyBox8gzXnTUD28B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ultimately, the intersection between regular glasses and a VR headset is where Meta is headed for the next few years. "Puffin," the current project hardware that's believed to become the Meta Quest 4, is essentially a pair of smart goggles that weigh less than 100g and have all the battery and computing technology in a pocketable iPod-like device.</p><p>Compare that to the current Quest 3, which weighs just over 500g, and you'll understand the difference this is going to make. Until that happens in late 2026 or early 2027, though, Meta is going to be sending a barrage of smart glasses in multiple form factors and price tags to see what sticks.</p><p>Will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor" target="_blank">Meta Hypernova</a>, with its single-lens display and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper" target="_blank">sEMG gesture bracelet</a>, catch on at a smartphone price level, or are consumers mainly interested in these glasses because they don't cost much more than a normal pair of Ray-Bans? We'll find out in less than 12 months, that's for sure.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to its information, the S26 Edge may receive a battery upgrade with a modest 300mAh capacity increase over the 2025 edition. For reference, the S25 Edge features a 3,900 mAh battery with 25W charging.</p><p>If the leak is accurate, the S26 Edge could see a 4,200mAh battery. Information on its charging strength wasn't stated, and it's far too early for definite calculations, especially when there are rumors about a change in "battery materials."</p><p>On the other hand, the post highlights a Galaxy S26 Pro rumor, which claims its battery could reach 4,300mAh.

This rumor was two-pronged, as the report claimed this bigger battery was the result of new "battery materials" that Samsung was looking into implementing. Additionally, those same rumors said the S26 Edge was going to be "even thinner" than its 5.8mm profile this year.</p><p>These new battery material rumors could either reference Samsung's rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">silicon-carbon route</a> or a more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN report</a>. The latter was detailed to offer a "significant" boost to a device's battery density while also improving its charging capabilities. We're still pretty far from a Galaxy S26 series debut, so this is all just food for thought right now.</p><p>Speaking of, the Galaxy S26 series might look a little different as a rumor claims Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">could drop the base model for a Pro</a>. If true, then the series would look like this: Galaxy S26 Pro, Galaxy S26 Edge, and Galaxy S26 Ultra. The Galaxy S Plus model would also get benched for Samsung's newer Edge ambitions, should this rumor be believed.

Instead of physically going into your ear canal with an ear tip, the Moto Buds Loop are more like a tiny speaker that sits right outside your ear. Open earbuds have a few advantages, such as the ability to hear ambient noise and less pressure and discomfort, but they will feel much different than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">traditional wireless earbuds</a>.</p><p>I've tried open earbuds that have an ear hook wrapping around your ear, and I'm a huge fan of ear hooks in general, even on traditional earbuds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a>. By comparison, the Moto Loop Buds clip straight onto your earlobe for a secure fit like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review">Bose Ultra Open earbuds</a>.</p><p>This was my first time trying open earbuds of this style, and I came away impressed. Once you put them on and adjust their fit, the Moto Loop Buds stay in place. There isn't a lot of clamping force, and there's some give in the Loop Buds that lets you pull them apart gently to place them on your ear.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XcPkKzfQSPdj8B3m9QA333" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-7" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XcPkKzfQSPdj8B3m9QA333.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I ran a few 5Ks with the Moto Loop Buds instead of the Powerbeats Pro 2, and in some ways, these Motorola earbuds were better. I had to adjust their position less while running and was more aware of my surroundings thanks to the open design, which allows ambient noise to reach my ears.</p><p>When you wear the Moto Loop Buds, they look a lot like earrings. The version I reviewed with Swarovski crystals doubles down on that look, and I like it. Though I've never worn earrings before, I think they look pretty good on me. They're simultaneously a loud piece of jewelry and a subtle pair of earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KCxFpvMSEkSMEfKNGtSM23" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-8" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KCxFpvMSEkSMEfKNGtSM23.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the heart of the Moto Buds Loop are dual 12mm ironless drivers, which are on the large side for earbuds.</p><p>In terms of sound, the Moto Buds Loop are about as good as open earbuds can be. I mentioned how the open design lets ambient sound in, but that works both ways. The sound created by these earbuds also goes out, and there's no seal or sound isolation present. That means they may not sound as loud or as bass-heavy as earbuds you're used to, although this is true of every pair of open earbuds.</p><p>With that in mind, the volume offered by the Moto Buds Loop was more than enough for my needs. The bass wasn't outstanding by any means, and there were a few bass-centric tracks that sounded silly with open earbuds, but those songs were the exception rather than the norm.</p><p>By default, the earbuds are set to the <strong>Bass boost</strong> equalizer preset to try and compensate. The EQ can be changed in the Moto Buds app, which works with any Android device. You can also enable dual connection, gaming mode, and change button shortcuts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TWfMMKFFKnyvS4A8WBbBB3" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-11" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWfMMKFFKnyvS4A8WBbBB3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto Loop Buds case is slightly larger than most traditional earbuds.

When using the Moto Buds Loop with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-review">Motorola Razr 2025</a>, the experience feels completely different compared to using these earbuds with a non-Motorola phone.</p><p>Spatial audio is only available with a Motorola handset, and that's a shame. The feature is mostly standard on earbuds in this price point, across devices and operating systems. Additionally, the <strong>Crystal Talk</strong> feature that uses AI to cancel out noise during a phone call is a Motorola exclusive. The spatial audio tool is particularly handy, as it combines with the open feel of the earbuds to create a more immersive experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoNoWfktbGjyMYzABxDSF4" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-3" alt="The Moto Buds Loop in PANTONE French Oak with Swarovski crystals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoNoWfktbGjyMYzABxDSF4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another gripe I have with the Moto Buds Loop is their on-earbud buttons. There's one button for each earbud, which isn't enough to handle volume control, playback control, and toggling voice assistants. Play/pause and previous/next work easily enough, but needing to triple-press the earbuds for volume control is annoying. If you need to drastically adjust the volume, you might need to press an earbud 10 to 15 times total.</p><p>During that process, the earbuds might misinterpret you trying to adjust the volume as trying to skip or restart the song, which can be frustrating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yzHVreBNu2M7aRNdQ6zhu" name="Moto-Buds-Loop-Review-9" alt="The Moto Buds Loop case on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzHVreBNu2M7aRNdQ6zhu.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, there is a learning curve to putting on the Moto Buds Loop. It might feel like you're mashing your earlobe to clip them on at first, though it does get better over time. Once you figure it out, it's not as hard, but they're still not my favorite earbuds to put on. The good news is, you only have to do it once, and the rest of your listening session is comfy.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-moto-buds-loop-competition"><span>Moto Buds Loop: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GHgwZHRQxikgWC2Bp985DM" name="bose-ultra-open-earbuds-outdoor-lifestyle.jpeg" alt="Bose Ultra Open Earbuds on a railing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GHgwZHRQxikgWC2Bp985DM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Bose Ultra Open earbuds might be Motorola's biggest competitor.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola's open earbuds are priced with the best of them, including the Bose Ultra Open earbuds.

To break things down, YouTube begins by stating its protections are AI-based. It adds that its AI software utilizes a "variety of signals" to help determine whether or not a user is under 18 or over.</p><p>The kinds of "signals" YouTube's AI looks for include the type of videos you're searching for, video categories you've watched, and the longevity of your account. If YouTube's AI deems an account to be under the age of 18, it will put forth a few limiters.</p><p>YouTube states such accounts will have their digital wellbeing tools activated, a limit set on "repetitive views" for "some kinds of content," and personalized advertising will be deactivated. Considering AI can get things wrong, YouTube states users can either use a credit card or their government-issued ID to prove they're above 18. Only a small set of U.S.-based users will see YouTube's AI-based protections for younger users roll out in the next few weeks.</p><p>The company states it will monitor this before expanding its availability.</p><h2 id="the-guidelines-change-2">The Guidelines Change</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube's platform will also see a change <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXtVRYCYp5M&ab_channel=CreatorInsider">to how it handles profanity</a> present in content creators' videos (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/07/30/youtube-new-profanity-guidelines-utilizes-ai-identify-teens/">9to5Google</a>). In the Creator Insider video, YouTube's Head of Monetization Policy Experience, Conor Kavanagh, states creators who swear (moderate or strong profanity) within the "first seven seconds" of their content will be eligible for full ad revenue. This was something that was in reverse two years ago, which YouTube states garnered a wealth of feedback.</p><p>Kavanagh goes into a little more depth, stating that "high frequency" levels of swearing in videos will still violate its rules.

The company increased the minimum age for livestreams, going from 13 to 16. So, if you're under the age of 16, you will need to have an adult visibly present with you on your livestream through its entirety. If not, YouTube states your stream's chat will be disabled, as well as "other" features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Compared to the Z Fold 6, the Fold 7's 200MP camera is reportedly "44% brighter and four times more detailed." Samsung highlights the camera's ability to keep a photo's sharp details even when users take advantage of its 2x optical-grade zoom.</p><p>An interesting upgrade is for the Fold 7's shutter speed. Samsung states it's been upgraded to be roughly seven times faster than before, meaning users can capture moments in action easier. The post highlights the Z Fold 7's "Dual Camera Depth Calibration," which helps to determine the distance you are from your subject, "intelligently" switching between the 200MP lens and the 12MP ultra-wide camera.</p><p>Even the selfie camera received some improvements for its 100-degree field of view. Over the Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">the Fold 7's</a> selfie camera provides a 25% wider photo that's reportedly five times clearer. Other upgrades include improved skin texture in photos, enhanced HDR processing, and AI-powered filters.</p><p>Samsung's Fold 7 filters go hand-in-hand with its Generative Edit and Suggest Erases features, fueled by Galaxy AI. Regarding Generative Edit, Samsung says its AI software updates have reduced its misgeneration rate and texture distortion.</p><h2 id="the-fold-7-struts-its-stuff-2">The Fold 7 struts its stuff</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4936px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="PP647NPFc5nG6kjh2Hi6qS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 sticking up through a bush" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PP647NPFc5nG6kjh2Hi6qS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4936" height="2777" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Videos on the Fold 7 take off with Samsung's 10-bit HDR recording capabilities. The post states this brings a "four times richer contrast and wider dynamic range." Additionally, the Fold 7 supports LOG video recordings, which should come in handy for creators (like vloggers) who enter the post-production phase for editing purposes and more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 has been catching a lot of attention this year, most likely due to its advancements for a slimmer build, AI, and other notable upgrades. The device has most recently been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-finally-pulls-ahead-of-the-flip-in-sales-in-korea">reported to have surpassed the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> in South Korean pre-orders. While the Flip 7 is typically the model consumers go for, the Fold 7 now accounts for 60% of the pre-order pie in Samsung's home country. And, a few hours ago today (July 31), the Fold 7 was reported to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-just-broke-every-z-fold-preorder-record-ever-set-in-the-us">been a hit in the U.S. market, too</a>.</p><p>For the U.S., the Fold 7's pre-order rate crushed the Flip 7, selling 50% faster than ever before. Carriers are also reporting an extreme surge in pre-orders for the Fold 7, and people are supposedly showing up more in person in stores to purchase it.</p><p>Samsung Display got in on the Fold 7 hype, discussing what it did to create <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">a stronger folding screen</a>. The division states the Fold 7's new foldable technology should keep going "even after" 500,000 folds, which, for the average person, would last them a decade.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="c6c66652-0b38-45c6-932f-33ff296a3ef2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n492cdTmAtXoxYWXC3iyrB.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With Samsung's 3rd generation Armor FlexHinge, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is 27% slimmer, and around 43% lighter.

That said, other sizes and LTE configurations are also receiving similarly-great discounts, so you can take your pick. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Watch-Latest-Model/dp/B0D912YVPQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="bc8e6b97-f073-489e-bab5-d600de853c83" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Watch 3 41mm (Wi-Fi): $349.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Watch 3 41mm (Wi-Fi): $349.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>As detailed in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">our 4.5/5-star review</a>, the Pixel Watch 3 is a nearly perfect wearable, boasting a gorgeous, water-droplet-inspired display, lightning-fast performance from a Snapdragon CPU, and over 24 hours of battery life on a single charge. The watch also comes with all of the latest health and fitness tracking features from Fitbit, while features like Workout builder and Cardio Load make it the perfect tool for runners.</p><p>Of course, no smartwatch is <em>truly </em>perfect, and the Pixel Watch 3 does have a few issues that you should consider before making a purchase. For one, it&apos;s important to note that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> is likely to be announced on August 20th, so you may want to wait if you don&apos;t mind paying extra for the latest technology. The Galaxy Watch 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-vs-samsung-galaxy-watch-7">also often compared</a> to the Pixel Watch 3, and you can actually grab that Samsung watch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1YQKDML"><strong>$70 cheaper at Amazon</strong></a> today.</p><p>So yes, you have some stuff to think about. But if you&apos;re a fan of Google devices and you&apos;re already immersed in the Pixel ecosystem, this is a rare deal on a &apos;unique and stylish&apos; device that shouldn&apos;t be missed if you&apos;ve had your eye on the smartwatch for a while. </p><h2 id="back-to-school-2025-at-android-central-x2014-quick-links-2">Back to school 2025 at Android Central — quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide"><em><strong>See our ultimate Back To School shopping guide</strong></em></a></li><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals">discounted headphones, dorm appliances, and more</a></li><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals">up to $250 off Chromebooks, tablets</a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/savings/electronics">major savings on Chromebooks, smart TVs</a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/">foldable phones, trade-in opportunities</a></li><li><strong>Lenovo: </strong><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/d/deals/doorbusters/">epic laptop sale, free shipping for students</a></li><li><strong>Dell:</strong> <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/deals">students get 10% off all back-to-school purchases</a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This could include minor bug fixes and minor performance enhancements. The firmware also notes that after updating the device with the July patch, users won't be able to downgrade to an older software version, considering it may impact the security of the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bRCYkr9uSETy5bRpvu7jQd" name="Galaxy-Z-fold-7-update" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 gets its first update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bRCYkr9uSETy5bRpvu7jQd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the July patch falls under versions<em><strong> F966BXXS2AYGG, F766BXXS2AYGD, and F761BXXS2AYG5</strong></em> and is backed by a stable version of One UI 8, as these devices show up with the stable version of the new software out of the box.

Depending on the results, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 9 could either stick with the status quo or course correct to the old circular style.</p><p>Samsung's Watch 8 squircle plans leaked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/future-galaxy-watches-may-adopt-apple-watch-squircle-design">over a year in advance</a>, so we're not expecting the Watch 9 to rock the boat. So if we accept that the squircle is here to stay, what else should the Galaxy Watch 9 add or change?</p><p>Based on our time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">reviewing the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> and our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-w">Galaxy Watch 8 hands-on</a>, here's what we'd like (or expect) to see from the Galaxy Watch 9.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-9-models"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 9: Models</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/owttN5qAUWQSMxnLyoQYWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung sold a Galaxy Watch 8, Watch 8 Classic, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Watch Ultra (2025)</a> this year. Since Samsung traditionally sells Classics on alternating years, the safest bet is that we'll only see a Galaxy Watch 9 and Watch Ultra (2026) next year.</p><p>We're still a big fan of the 2022 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, which Samsung skipped for the Ultra last year. Now that Samsung has started selling three models per year, we'd love to see a Pro resurrection that's lighter and longer-lived than the Classic and Ultra.</p><p>Unfortunately, since a titanium frame and long battery life are key Ultra selling points, we won't get our hopes up about a Watch 9 Pro.</p><p>There's also a decent chance Samsung will sell a cheap Galaxy Watch FE 2 next year. Apple releases its budget SE watches every 2–3 years, and since the first Watch FE came out in 2024, Samsung might follow its rival's lead in 2026.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-9-likely-specs-and-features"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 9: Likely specs and features</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pryAeGXhZDXVRmSfCcJUXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung rarely backslides on features offered from past generations, so it's safe to say that the Galaxy Watch 9 will come in two sizes, each aluminum case sporting a 5ATM water-resistant and MIL-STD-810H protective rating.</p><p>The last two Galaxy Watch generations used the 3nm Exynos W1000 chip with 2GB of RAM. Aside from the old Tizen OS watches, we've never seen one chip last three generations of Galaxy Watches, so there's a <em>possibility</em> of a new, faster 3nm chip, or at least a new coprocessor to handle background tasks and AI more efficiently.</p><p>We'll eventually see Galaxy Watches go beyond Bluetooth 5.3 and WiFi 5GHz into 6.0 and 6GHz. And we could see the Watch 9 add ultra-wideband (like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> has), enabling features such as digital car keys, paired watch/phone unlocking, or better Find My tools. But we can only speculate if the Watch 9 gets them or a later generation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-BioActive-sensor" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's bottom BioActive sensor with green, red, and blue lights activated when testing your skin for antioxidants." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRqhJfgismGivjVXBGTjuf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since Google continues to make Wear OS more battery efficient every year, Samsung won't feel much pressure to increase the Watch 9's capacity too far beyond the Watch 8's 325/435mAh capacity, sticking to the same 40-hour estimate.</p><p>That also applies to the 10W WPC fast charging that the last three generations of Galaxy Watches have used. Faster charging can deteriorate battery capacity, so Samsung will let rivals like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> beat the Galaxy Watch 9 for speed. We would love to see Samsung adopt Qi2 charging on the Watch 9, at least.</p><p>Lastly, Samsung should bring back the same BioActive sensor that enables all of the new health tracking tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-and-raised-score">Antioxidant Index</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-running-coach-galaxy-watch-8-is-cool-idea-held-back-by-hardware-and-execution">Running Coach</a>, Vascular Load, and AGEs Index. It could <em>improve</em> it with new LEDs, like the Watch 7 added, but the fundamentals will be unchanged.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-9-what-we-want-and-expect-to-see"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 9: What we want and expect to see</span></h2><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 had a clear strategy: stick to the same hardware template with a thinner, squircle "Cushion Design" and a bunch of new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> health tools. The Galaxy Watch 9 will probably continue down this same path.</p><p>Samsung has publicly speculated about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-explores-possible-galaxy-watch-fitness-subscription-report">Samsung Health subscription</a>, and most of its Galaxy AI disclaimers say that the tools are free through 2025. So it seems likely the Galaxy Watch 9 will push out even more health and fitness tools to justify a subscription.</p><p>We don't necessarily <em>want</em> to pay monthly for Health tools, but it seems a likely possibility. Let's focus instead on the Galaxy Watch 9 tools that we <em>do</em> want.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="fxLVdKotvK45pxQvKPqjVG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-7" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 next to Flip 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fxLVdKotvK45pxQvKPqjVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Better battery life</strong></p><p>Samsung is working on denser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">all-solid-state batteries</a>, or "Dream Batteries," according to a report. It claims that Samsung wants to insert this tech into Galaxy Buds, the Galaxy Ring 2, and future Galaxy Watches.</p><p>We'd love to see this in the Galaxy Watch 9, but the report suggested these "dream batteries" may not be ready until the Galaxy Watch 10 in 2027. And it may also be more expensive than your typical lithium-ion battery, and we don't want the Watch 9 price to rise again so soon.</p><p>In the meantime, we can only hope that some combination of a more efficient Wear OS 7, a better coprocessor, or extra capacity will make the Watch 9 longer-lived. I doubt we'll see it come close to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, but if it can hit 50 hours per charge instead of 40, that alone would be worth an upgrade.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UZPtZn4kjRjQRF6LvsqxTG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-20" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025) hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZPtZn4kjRjQRF6LvsqxTG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Thicker watch bands</strong></p><p>Plenty of Galaxy Watch fans' wishlists would start with a return to a more circular design. But since Samsung isn't likely to relent on its squircle look anytime soon, I'll instead bring up this request from my colleague Brady, who is currently reviewing the standard Watch 8.</p><p>He likes the Watch 8 design in person, calling it "super thin" and praising the contrast between the dark screen and metallic squircle. But he doesn't like how the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-bands">Galaxy Watch 8 bands</a> look "really narrow compared to the thick squircle case," emphasizing instead of masking the squircle's size.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> has wider bands that proportionally match its size. I'm not sure if the current Dynamic Lug system can accommodate a wider band, but hopefully, this is something Samsung can figure out by the Galaxy Watch 9 launch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="NPceH7NH6uy5qSLcgB6EsM" name="Gemini-on-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic" alt="The Gemini app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, which lays on a black marble table next to plant leaves and an Android mascot figurine." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NPceH7NH6uy5qSLcgB6EsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>New Gemini tools</strong></p><p>This request is as much about Google and its Wear OS 7 plans as about Samsung.

But beyond that, we'd like to see Gemini integrate more closely with Samsung Health so it can provide direct coaching based on your data.</p><p>We'd also like to see Gemini Live come to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> for more in-depth conversations.

It comes pre-installed on most Android devices, offers a familiar and easy-to-use interface, and includes several built-in protective features. However, Chrome on Android has been missing a basic security layer, but it looks like Google is finally working to fix that.</p><p>As spotted by Android guru <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman" target="_blank">Mishaal Rahman</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-chrome-password-autofill-biometrics-3582675/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>), Google is preparing to add a much-needed feature to Chrome on Android that will require users to authenticate with biometrics before autofilling passwords on websites.</p><p>Currently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> does include an option labeled "<strong>Authenticate with biometrics before filling passwords</strong>" in the Autofill settings. You may have already noticed that Google Password Manager typically prompts you for fingerprint or face authentication when autofilling passwords, but this only applies inside apps.</p><p>That same protection does not currently extend to browsers. When using Chrome, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-google-password-manager-android-and-web" target="_blank">Google Password Manager</a> autofills your credentials without requiring verification. Thankfully, it looks like Google is now addressing this gap by making biometric verification necessary in all apps, including Chrome.</p><h2 id="you-ll-soon-need-biometrics-to-autofill-passwords-in-chrome-2">You'll soon need biometrics to autofill passwords in Chrome</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RvNooXGhZbXpf4aEQH7HLk" name="google-chrome-autofill-new-setting-android" alt="Upcoming autofill settings in Google Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvNooXGhZbXpf4aEQH7HLk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2080" height="1170" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to the report, the setting will soon be renamed to "<strong>Verify it's you to autofill passwords</strong>", and it will appear at the bottom of the main settings page within Google Password Manager. While the functionality will mostly remain the same, Rahman notes that the updated description says the feature is "coming soon to Chrome".</p><p>This change means that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-much-does-chrome-incognito-know-about-me">Chrome</a> will soon require fingerprint, face, or screen lock authentication before autofilling saved passwords. That's a big improvement over the current system, where passwords are automatically filled in without confirming the user's identity, which is a big risk if your phone ends up in the wrong hands.</p><p>There is no official release date yet for when this will roll out widely in Google Chrome for Android. However, since the option has started to appear for some users in Google Password Manager, it likely won't be long. We'll keep you updated as soon as more information becomes available.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are plenty of reasons for this, but a major one that many of us don't really understand is where the line between Android itself and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">Google gets drawn.</a></p><p>It's simple once you understand how it works, but it can be tough to do so because Google's relationship with Android isn't like Microsoft's with Windows or Apple's with iOS. It's not what most people are familiar with.</p><p>Let's start with the very basics. You might have heard all this before, but it's really important, so I'm starting here so everyone can understand.</p><p>Android started as an OS to run digital cameras and was started by the people behind the Sidekick. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-evolution-of-android-decades-of-transformation">Google purchased the company about 20 years ago</a> with the idea of using it for mobile devices. It's come a long way since.</p><p>Android lives as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">millions of lines of code</a> that anyone can download and do whatever they like with it. If you make any changes and distribute any products using it, you might need to share some of that code.</p><p><strong>You can not buy a device that runs Android the way it sits</strong>. It's complete, but it isn't filled with features and apps, including the ones you need and love.</p><p>A company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung that sells Android phones</a> downloads it, changes the heck out of it, and adds a bunch of stuff to it. So does a company like Motorola or OnePlus. But you can't buy <em>these</em> phones, either.</p><p>Google then comes into play, and this is where things get confusing. To use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/distribute/marketing-tools/brand-guidelines" target="_blank">trademarked version of the word Android</a> on your device, marketing materials, or packaging, you must follow Google's rules. You can do whatever you like and call your device JerryOS powered by Android, but if you want anything from Google, including the "proper" name Android, you must follow certain rules.</p><p>These rules have a few bits about hardware, some technical details, but most of them surround the Android app subsystem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-update-01" alt="Updating to One UI 8 on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TV3t5LMRSBccRMwNn8WG6h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So far, Samsung has made a phone and built <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">its version of Android</a> for it. It now needs to "Googlefy" it. Google says what must be included as well as what can't be included.</p><p>The phone must include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google Play Services</a> to make sure all apps built with it are compatible. It also must include a growing list of Google's own Android apps, such as Gmail, Chrome, the Google Search app, Maps, etc. Samsung puts all these in a folder on your home screen if you want an idea of what's all included, or visit the Google Play Store and search Google to see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=google&c=apps" target="_blank">a list of its other apps</a>.</p><p>Some of these apps replicate free open-source apps that are part of Android itself. Samsung can (and does) include its versions of these apps, too. Even though Samsung includes a full-featured web browser (for example), it still must include Google Chrome because it has to follow Google's rules to get approval.</p><p>An easy way to think about this is that if a phone maker wants to have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play">Google Play Store</a> on its phones, it has to follow all the rules. But what if they don't?</p><p>Enter a company like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-murena-one-is-pure-android-not-pure-google">Murena</a>. It sells <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wonder-what-life-is-like-without-google-or-apple-you-need-to-try-this-alternative">Android phones <em><strong>without</strong></em> any Google inside</a>. There is no Google Play Store or other Google apps like Chrome or Photos, but there are alternatives pre-installed that Google doesn't make or own.</p><p>Finally, you have Google's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel Phones</a>. Everything about them, from top to bottom, comes directly from Google. All the free open-source apps that are part of Android are gone, and you won't see anything from Samsung unless you install it yourself.</p><h2 id="why-does-this-matter-2">Why does this matter?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GhmdfLkWNegVDKsf57vDqF" name="best-android-apps-hero.jpg" alt="Best Android apps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GhmdfLkWNegVDKsf57vDqF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To a lot of people (I'll even go as far as saying most people), it doesn't matter. All you need to know is that Android isn't just Google, but your phone has a bunch of software that is, because it has to.</p><p>The real distinction is the code. Android comes with a phone dialer. Google, Samsung, Motorola, and most other companies also make a phone dialer and replace the Android one with their own. They may even include both, and you'll have to choose which one to use by default when you first use it.</p><p>If Google forced companies to use its own phone dialer, you wouldn't have any of this, and you wouldn't have hundreds of other developers working on ideas to make the phone dialer better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YshR7FKjo43gb4jap6ipXK" name="galaxy-s20-how-to-google-duo.jpg" alt="Google Duo in the Samsung dialer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YshR7FKjo43gb4jap6ipXK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You also wouldn't have access to the code because Google's apps are not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-open-source-android-z">open-source</a>. They develop these apps in-house and don't share anything, and aren't required to share it.</p><p>Part of the reason Android (without Google's stuff inside) is more secure than any other commercially available operating system, including Apple's iOS, is that people are constantly looking through that code, trying to break and exploit it. Nobody can audit the code for the Gmail app, so we have no idea what bugs might be living inside. When bugs are found, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-important-are-android-security-patches">they are patched</a>, and they are found a lot sooner when the source code is available.</p><p>I see this question a lot, and mostly from people who are simply curious about how it works. None of it makes a difference in the way you use your phone every day.</p><p>It is important, though, and it can be interesting to watch Google try to increase its influence over Android phones more and more every year. Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing, this is how it does it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The boost came from strong sales across its lineup, not just phones but also laptops, smartwatches, tablets, and even smart rings.</p><p>Even with a rough Q2 for semiconductors, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-q1-device-earnings-soar-its-chip-sales-take-a-hit">found some balance in its mobile and electronics divisions</a>.

The clamshell foldable is still rocking a dual-camera system on the cover with a 50MP primary and 12MP ultrawide sensor, and a 10MP front-facing camera.</p><p>The question is, did Samsung's switch to an in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-official-exynos-2500-soc-unpacked-devices-reveal">Exynos 2500</a> processor result in better image quality for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>? Between a new chip and revamped computational photography tech, it's possible that the new model could beat the older Galaxy Z Flip 6 — even with identical hardware.</p><p>To find out, I put the Galaxy Z Flip 7 through a gauntlet of camera tests against the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Galaxy S25. As it turns out, Samsung's image processing has noticeably changed on the new Flip. However, which one you prefer might depend on your individual style preferences. Let's dive in.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-primary-camera"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Primary camera</span></h2><p>A key perk of owning a clamshell foldable is having access to your best camera nearly all of the time. For the Galaxy Z Flip 7, that's the 50MP primary camera with an f/1.8 aperture and a 1/1.57-inch sensor size. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> has the same primary shooter, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, included for reference, has a 50MP f/1.8 sensor with a nearly-identical sensor size.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 does have a unique computational photography profile and color science, as you can see in the camera samples below. It has more color saturation in photos and loves contrast, occasionally at the expense of staying true to real-world colors. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 can appear washed out at times, so in this area, the new model is improved.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u36tWykomdXb6k9fC3QYyZ" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Camera-7" alt="Camera comparisons shot on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u36tWykomdXb6k9fC3QYyZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RGqGuTPrN4P4xDSYFq3Dma" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Camera-1" alt="Camera comparisons shot on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGqGuTPrN4P4xDSYFq3Dma.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yCJa7uTSDgijyjP5YaRq3Z" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Camera-11" alt="Camera comparisons shot on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yCJa7uTSDgijyjP5YaRq3Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DsPVWU9vJyFEuJEM2gyG6Z" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Camera-4" alt="Camera comparisons shot on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsPVWU9vJyFEuJEM2gyG6Z.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f2QAUNdZdUf5zPwSDiAtda" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Camera-5" alt="Camera comparisons shot on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2QAUNdZdUf5zPwSDiAtda.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For example, in the first slide, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 has too much saturation and contrast, causing the palm tree bark to be heavily darkened. The sunset colors in the sky are richer, but everything else in the photo is darker to achieve that result. In the second slide, this strategy works, as the Flip 7 recreates the blue sign better than the Flip 6.</p><p>The third and fifth slides feature more of the same darker colors and heavy contrast — look for the roof color in the former and the leaf color in the latter. The selfie shot in the fourth slide flips the script, as I feel the Flip 6 does a better job recreating my skin tone accurately than the Flip 7. It may suggest that the Flip 7 is using different color science profiles for faces and landscapes, which wouldn't be too surprising</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uvMc2h4JRHPUjcCChVGXLG" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-S25-Camera-3" alt="Shots captured with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvMc2h4JRHPUjcCChVGXLG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QHCH5Bro6aFv2qG9hqWdTH" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-S25-Camera-4" alt="Shots captured with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QHCH5Bro6aFv2qG9hqWdTH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5GikYcT2Na6qGF99iBYkSG" name="Z-Flip-7-vs-S25-Camera-5" alt="Shots captured with the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5GikYcT2Na6qGF99iBYkSG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Compared to the Galaxy S25, shots are surprisingly similar.

Night shots were hard to capture well, especially with light sources nearby that messed with the camera lenses. In some cases, I found that the Flip 6 did a slightly better job isolating light sources at night, preventing them from blowing out the entire image.</p><p>While I shot almost all of this test using the default settings, the one exception is the first slide below. The lit buildings on the water were too much for either handset, and I had to flick on Night mode to even get a discernible image.

Based on what I've seen, it feels like an effort to produce images that are more realistic.

It is showing up gradually, so not everyone will see it right away. That said, Rahman caught it running on a clean install of Chrome 138 (the latest stable version).</p><p>Swiping from the edge now brings up a preview of where you’re headed, sliding the next page partway in so you can decide if you actually want to go there.</p><p>The new back animation in Chrome looks a lot like what Safari does on iOS. Android’s own predictive back system also borrows a bit from the iPhone.</p><h2 id="wanna-try-it-now-2">Wanna try it now?</h2><p>If you’re curious to try the new Chrome animation early, you don’t have to wait. Just drop the flag URL below into the address bar and hit enter. Then, it’ll take you straight to the setting. Open the dropdown, switch it to “Enabled,” and tap “Relaunch” to turn it on.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code>chrome://flags/#back-forward-transitions</code></pre><p>The feature behaves a bit differently if the previous screen wasn’t just another page in your browsing history. In other words, it adjusts based on where you came from.</p><p>Chrome’s back swipe doesn’t always show the same thing, as it depends on how you landed on the page. If you opened it from another app, you’ll catch a glimpse of that app as you swipe.</p><p>If it leads back to a new tab, you’ll just get a blank gray screen with the Chrome logo. But if the page came from a link in another tab, don’t expect a preview since it’ll just snap back without the animation.</p><h2 id="visual-previews-that-actually-help-2">Visual previews that actually help</h2><p>Chrome’s new animation builds on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-early-deep-dive-expected-features">Android’s predictive back gesture</a>, which started evolving in Android 13. But Chrome pushes it further: holding a back swipe doesn’t just show a vague app switch anymore. You actually get a live preview of the last webpage, smoothly scaled and faded in.</p><p>While it’s a subtle touch, it could help cut down on annoying accidental exits from something important.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It was previously limited to YouTube’s web and mobile apps, but it’s now popping up on TVs too.</p><p>The TV version of Jump Ahead works a bit differently than on mobile or web. Instead of showing a “Jump Ahead” button when you try to skip past a popular spot, it marks the ideal skip point with a dot on the progress bar. When you fast-forward using your remote, the dot gets highlighted, and hitting it again jumps you straight to that moment.</p><h2 id="way-better-than-double-tap-hell-2">Way better than double-tap hell</h2><p>Prior to this update, double-tapping on YouTube just skipped a few seconds ahead.

The latest beta is seemingly light on new features, at least in its changelog. Starting, the patch notes state Beta 4 has added "support for high quality voice, video, and enhanced chat services" in the Samsung IMS Service Emergency feature.</p><p>The update also brings full-screen support for videos when switching using Samsung DeX.</p><p>One UI 8 Beta 4 dives into its bug fixes heavily, as Samsung is likely (hopefully) on the final stretch for its testing with users. Some of the standout fixes include a solution to a bug users encountered with outgoing calls via Swipe to Call. This bug occurred when attempting to call someone on your contacts list when TalkBack was enabled. There's a bug fix on its way for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Galaxy S25 series'</a> camera.</p><p>Samsung states the "flickering issue," present on the horizontal/vertical leveling icon when switching between the front and rear cameras, has been fixed. A "fingerprint sensor not responding" error, which was previously wrongfully displayed over the lock screen, has been solved.</p><p>Beta 4's patch notes highlight the remaining fixes:</p><ul><li>Fixed a loading issue when Bixby routine commands are triggered via voice</li><li>Fixed a display issue in the quick launch icon area on the lock screen</li><li>Fixed an issue with editing iNavi dashcam videos in the Gallery app</li><li>Fixed an operational issue with Galaxy AI Reply Suggestions</li></ul><h2 id="marching-toward-one-ui-8-2">Marching toward One UI 8</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Considering Beta 4 was spotted earlier this morning, enrolled testers should begin noticing it as the day progresses. Of course, it could take time, so keep checking as the week starts winding down. The publication speculates that this could be the final beta update Galaxy S25 series testers see, and we're hoping for the same.</p><p>The One UI 8 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-one-ui-8-first-beta-announced-for-galaxy-s25-series">kicked off back in May</a>, a few weeks before Google officially launched Android 16. The initial update brought in the Galaxy S25 series to the updated Android OS, which is something that was already said to be on the company's newest foldables right out of the box.</p><p>As of late, Samsung's been getting other areas of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-just-supercharged-these-handy-good-lock-modules-for-one-ui-8">software ecosystem in order</a>, in preparation for One UI 8's stable launch. The company's entire Good Lock module toolkit was updated last week to line up with what it's been testing and getting ready for One UI 8. While updates to Home Up let users change how apps start up, it also upgraded MultiStar, NavStar, and QuickStar.</p><p>Those modules have now moved into a more One UI 8-ready state. Hopefully, we're looking at an August launch for Samsung's Android 16 update officially.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

As expected, this initial closed beta test is for the Phone 3 model, which runs Android 16 throughout its entirety. Nothing explains to interested testers that this first build will focus on "delivering Android 16’s native features as well as implementing a more robust design system which will set the foundation for a more cohesive UI moving forward."</p><p>The company didn't divulge the features users could see on the Phone 3; however, it highlighted the conditions users might meet before joining.</p><p>Considering it's an early beta, Nothing stresses confidentiality to potential testers. It also teases that this first closed beta will likely last between August to "early" September. Nothing is looking for users who utilize their Phone 3 daily and are willing to engage and provide feedback to the team.</p><p>Users can begin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing-tech.sg.larksuite.com/share/base/form/shrlgKaR9D6Cuqepd6CzJXDrRlc">filling out the signup form</a> for the Nothing OS 4.0 closed beta. You have until 12 pm ET on August 3 to get your name in the running for eligibility.

Shortly after, the company's CEO, Carl Pei, highlighted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phones-to-get-android-16-powered-nothing-os-4-0-later-this-year">plans to bring Android 16</a> to users this year. Pei's comments informed users that Android 16, under Nothing OS 4.0, would likely launch toward the end of Q3.</p><p>Considering the closed beta is running through August into early September, and the Open Beta is starting in September, maybe Nothing's fast-tracking its next OS release to meet that deadline.</p><p>Either way, Pei states that the Phone 3 will receive the upgrade first before older models, like the Phone 2.</p><p>In a similar vein, Nothing's co-founder, Akis Evangelidis, dropped some welcome insight about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-android-os-upgrades-five-year-confirmation">Phone 3's software lifespan</a>. The company is preparing to support the Phone 3 with five years of Android OS upgrades and seven years of security patches. While its Android OS side isn't quite up to Google's or Samsung's level of support, it's a good start in Nothing's "true flagship" direction.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="492a75a3-7d56-44b0-88c8-81de14e1e249">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdeEWY6LkaLEKRNnhJp4dY.jpg' alt="An official product render of the black Nothing Phone 3"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Nothing Phone 3</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the brand's first major step into the world of a "true flagship."

Aside from the initial onboarding where you sign into Google and download a few apps, Samsung largely leaves you to figure things out for yourself. You can easily miss out on quality-of-life features if you don't search through menus for them.</p><p>That's where I come in. Having reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> — as well as the Ultra, 6 Classic, and 5 Pro — I'm intimately familiar with Samsung's One UI Watch software, including the newest features like the Multi-Info Tiles, Now Bar, and Gemini that you'll want to dive into straight away.</p><p>These are the 10 Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 features or settings to activate or change straight out of the box. <em><strong>Note:</strong></em> You'll find Settings by either swiping down from the main watch face and tapping the cog icon or opening the Galaxy Wearable app on your phone.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-gestures-and-shortcuts"><span>Enable gestures and shortcuts</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Even the best smartwatch UI can be tedious to navigate through, by virtue of the small screen. Save yourself a bunch of time by enabling shortcuts to your favorite apps out of the box.</p><p>Tap <strong>Settings > Buttons and Gestures</strong>. Here, Galaxy Watch 8 owners will find two shortcuts for the Home button; I like changing the Home double press to open my favorite app instead of the last app opened, and the long press to open Gemini instead of Bixby or the power menu.</p><p>You can also edit the back button short press, but "Go to previous screen" is too convenient for navigation to lose.</p><p>If you specifically have the Watch 8 Classic, you can edit the third Quick button; it defaults to Samsung Health exercises but can open your stopwatch, flashlight, water lock, camera controller, or voice recorder instead.

And if you toggle the Secondary action on, a double pinch will take you to your latest notification or next Tile, without having to scroll.</p><p>Its companion is the <strong>Shake gesture</strong>: Twisting your fist up 90 degrees will also dismiss alerts and timers, as well as decline incoming calls or return to the main watch face from a notification.

Scroll down to the bottom of any Tile and tap the <strong>+ button</strong>; you'll be shown "Featured" Tile suggestions that fit the theme, followed by a list of all eligible apps with a Tile widget. Some apps have two Tile options: a condensed half-screen widget and a full-screen one.</p><p>For the Health tile, for example, you may want to add the antioxidant index, food calorie tracking, hydration tracking, medication reminders, mood tracking, cycle tracking, or the new Vascular Load widget.

You can also <strong>customize</strong> to change the background image, style, color, indexes, and complications of a given watch.</p><p>I've always found customizing on-watch to be really finicky, so I recommend using the mobile Galaxy Wearable app, where you can see more options at once, including tons of "Premade" styles with varied colors and backgrounds.</p><p>Tap <strong>Watch faces</strong> in-app, and you can scroll through every option by category, or tap "Discover more watch faces" at the bottom to search by color, style, and specific data.

It's a wide range of data meant to quantify whether you're sleeping healthily enough to stay at your best.</p><p>If you enable <strong>Sleep apnea detection</strong> in the <strong>Samsung Health Monitor app</strong>, Samsung will alert you after two days of sleep tracking if it sees signs of "moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea. It's not diagnostically accurate, but it gives you a reason to speak to a doctor if the signs are there.</p><p>After three nights of sleep, Samsung will generate a <strong>Vascular Load</strong> score. It judges whether your heart is under stress, whether from workouts or lifestyle impacts like sodium intake or blood pressure, and tells you whenever your load is higher than normal.</p><p>Samsung will also be able to judge your "sleep pressure" and circadian rhythm after three days to suggest an "optimal bedtime" that "maximizes alertness the next day." After a full week of sleep data, it'll start "coaching" you, giving you a sleep animal related to the type of sleeper you are and pushing you to form healthier bedtime habits.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-your-diet-with-antioxidant-index"><span>Change your diet with antioxidant index</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YRvC6D2xKjaddmtpwBw3TE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-vegetables" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic sitting on a plate surrounded by bell peppers and carrots, the display showing the Antioxidant widget with a "Low" score." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRvC6D2xKjaddmtpwBw3TE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the main Galaxy Watch 8 headliner features is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-antioxidant-index-and-raised-score">antioxidant index</a>, which measures your thumb for carotenoids, aka the antioxidant pigments in fruits and vegetables that give them their vibrant red, orange, and yellow coloring, and give <em>you</em> a healthy way to counterbalance the effects of aging and stress on your body.</p><p>Once you add the antioxidant index to your Health tile, measuring it is easy; you simply tap the widget, then <strong>Measure</strong>, then <strong>Ok</strong> under "Start measuring."

While the expanded cover screen is a visual masterpiece, its software experience actually takes a step backward.

Samsung also supports Bluetooth 5.4 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">Bluetooth Low Energy</a>, which is used to connect to your favorite devices and also for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-to-use-bluetooth-audio-sharing-on-google-pixel">audio sharing in Android 16.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NAVKaQcyBkmn9qiyCRLzCA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-19" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAVKaQcyBkmn9qiyCRLzCA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The wireless antenna bands on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 (left) and Flip 7 (right). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I tested a Galaxy Z Flip 7 review unit from AT&T, and used its 5G Turbo network throughout the review period in addition to my personal AT&T line. To gauge how well both the phone and the network performed, I ran around the Phoenix metro, testing my 5G speeds as I went. They were never lower than 150Mbps and peaked at 300Mbps, which are excellent speeds. While theoretical 5G speeds may be higher, these are great figures for real-world 5G usage.</p><p>Between the device's Exynos 5400 modem and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/plans/att-turbo/" target="_blank">AT&T's 5G Turbo network</a>, my wireless experience was rock solid. I didn't notice any dropoff compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which uses a Qualcomm modem integrated into the system-on-a-chip. Thanks to the Exynos 5400, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 supports satellite connectivity for the first time.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-and-displays"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7: Design and displays</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-13" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kumMMHqk6SSeYYTugbAtoP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>The 4.1-inch cover screen is beautiful, but it's still extremely software-limited.</strong></li><li><strong>The wider aspect ratio of the 6.9-inch main display is a game-changer for usability.</strong></li><li><strong>There's a premium feel and a form factor that's only 13.7mm thin when folded. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buying guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank"><strong>Best foldable phones</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank"><strong>Best Android phones</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones" target="_blank"><strong>Best Samsung phones</strong></a><strong></strong></p></div></div><p>It took Samsung a few generations, but the Galaxy Z Flip 7 finally feels like a traditional smartphone thanks to bigger displays with wider aspect ratios.

The alleged pricing suggests the company's Pixel 10 Pro Fold will push into the $2,000 sector, which reminds us of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. According to the publication, Google's 2nd-gen foldable will supposedly offer a 256GB, 512GB, and a new 1TB option for $1,799, $1,919, and $2,149, respectively.</p><p>The first two pricing (and storage) numbers aren't anything new; the original Pro Fold was priced similarly. However, if the rumors are true, then the 1TB option could really push consumers over the $2,000 mark. Although you can say the 512GB did the same thing when it first launched, since, you know, taxes exist, but I digress.</p><p>Out of the fold and into the slab, rumors claim the Pixel 10 Pro XL will see its starting line moved slightly. The post claims this device will drop its 128GB option entirely, meaning its 256GB will take over at $1,199, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">like in 2024</a>. Prices then supposedly rise to $1,319 and $1,549 for its 512GB and 1TB.</p><p>The publication then dips into the Pixel 10 Pro, stating it could see the following prices:</p><ul><li>128GB: $999</li><li>256GB: $1,099</li><li>512GB: $1,219</li><li>1TB: $1,449</li></ul><h2 id="the-story-thus-far-2">The story thus far</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.95%;"><img id="Dsi9zdTHMnQZ7rfvdtbLF5" name="google-pixel-10-official-teaser" alt="A teaser render for the Pixel 10, courtesy of Google's official store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dsi9zdTHMnQZ7rfvdtbLF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1888" height="962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base Pixel 10 will allegedly remain similar to its 9 series counterpart at $799 and $899 for its 128GB and 256GB variations.</p><p>The rumors put forth by the publication seem to contradict a previous rumor about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">Pixel 10 series' storage configurations</a>. The mix-up only regards the Pixel 10 Pro XL series and the potential dismissal of its 128GB option. Earlier this month, it was suggested that the device would retain the lower-end storage option; however, it might only be available for its Obsidian version. That color choice would grab 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB, leaving the other colors with 256GB and 512GB.</p><p>There's a chance this <em>could </em>change how we're seeing its pricing, at least, on its lower side, but we'll have to wait and see.</p><p>A more recent leak today (July 30) claims Google's Pixel 10 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving">could natively support</a> the WPC's Qi2 wireless charging magnets.

MMS stands for multimedia messaging service, which is a lengthy term for messages containing images, GIFs, and more. In the publication's test, it notes that while MMS in T-Satellite could help it "stand out" from others, there are some things users should be aware of.</p><p>The post highlights problems users may run into when attempting to send images, videos, and GIFs. Regarding photos, those seem to be sent within a two-minute timespan, per their test. Videos, which are typically larger files, took roughly 10 to 20 minutes to send. PCMag details how staggering this was for a couple of five-second clips.</p><p>If someone on a stable cellular network or otherwise is attempting to send you an MMS text, it will "take some time to download" over T-Mobile's T-Satellite network.</p><p>Other media received over the T-Satellite system doesn't take as long, but the publication states is it will still "take some time to download." It's also worth keeping in mind that MMS messages, like regular texts, will require users to remain in clear view of the sky to avoid any further disruptions and delays.</p><h2 id="t-satellite-keeps-you-involved-2">T-Satellite keeps you involved</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v75XjLy2f7tk5Wkzy5JKq9" name="T-Mobile-spacex-starlink-above-beyond.jpg" alt="T-Mobile and SpaceX team up for Coverage Above & Beyond" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v75XjLy2f7tk5Wkzy5JKq9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SpaceX)</span></figcaption></figure><p>T-Mobile and Starlink have been down this satellite connectivity path for a while now, which started steamrolling <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/fcc-approves-t-mobile-and-starlinks-direct-to-cell-service">after the FCC gave the go-ahead</a>. This snowballed earlier this year in January when T-Mobile started rolling out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/t-mobile-customers-direct-to-cell-beta-registration">its satellite texting beta</a>. The two companies prioritized those working in emergency fields first, giving them an up-close look at how things will work upon launch.</p><p>With an expected 2025 release, T-Mobile and Starlink made good on those estimations, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/best-network-in-america">launching the T-Satellite service</a> on July 23. The announcement highlighted a positive testing period, with over 1.8 million users joining in, even some from AT&T and Verizon networks. T-Mobile has clearly explained everything interested customers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/coverage/satellite-phone-service">need to know about joining</a>, but there are some more details. The T-Satellite service is reportedly included in the T-Mobile Experience Beyond plan "at no extra cost."</p><p>However, all other customers, even those from AT&T and Verizon, must adhere to the $10 additional monthly fee.</p><p>This initial announcement mentioned what PCMag has started noticing this week: the arrival of MMS capabilities. While T-Satellite launched with SMS (regular texts) for Android and iOS, MMS was lined up to join at a later date, which we're now seeing at the end of July. Keep in mind, T-Mobile states there's more to come as a "data-based service" is set to go live on October 1.</p> ]]></dc:content>

During a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/TqQ6E23OSr8?si=GqAW_45GofsERTuy">livestream</a>, AYANEO CEO Arthur Zhang revealed the specs that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-ayaneo-pocket-ds-is-the-worlds-first-dual-screen-android-handheld">Pocket DS</a> will have once released.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1929px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gsZyNLgqshgngcG2RHDsuj" name="AYANEO Pocket DS Specs" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS Specs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gsZyNLgqshgngcG2RHDsuj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1929" height="1085" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes the Pocket DS stand out the most is obviously the clamshell form factor. However, unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>, the Pocket DS actually has both a top and bottom screen, giving it a distinct advantage for DS and 3DS emulation.</p><p>Both screens sport a 1080p resolution, but the main 7-inch display is an OLED panel with a variable refresh rate up to 165Hz. Meanwhile, the 5-inch lower screen is your standard LCD panel and lacks faster refresh rates beyond 60Hz.</p><p>That's not to say that the bottom screen should be ignored, as the 4:3 aspect ratio makes it perfect for a lot of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/these-are-the-5-retro-gaming-handheld-deals-you-need-and-2-you-dont-before-prime-day-is-over">retro gaming</a>. AYANEO has also implemented a few tricks in the software to enhance the versatility, such as being able to use a "three-finger swipe" gesture to swap what's shown between the top and bottom screens.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fzg3HW5H88fMgmPn7NBmTE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-black-and-yellow-sharing-session-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fzg3HW5H88fMgmPn7NBmTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="g4jczqS662VfnDDjZRaCNE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-black-and-yellow-promo-renders" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g4jczqS662VfnDDjZRaCNE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2304" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JbZJgJ7S3mUevUMstVvYRE" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-promo-render-2" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JbZJgJ7S3mUevUMstVvYRE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Pretty much everything about the Pocket DS looks incredible, including the 8,000mAh battery and ergonomic design. However, I was a bit surprised to see that AYANEO opted to implement the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/snapdragon-g-series-chips">Snapdragon G3x Gen 2</a>, as opposed to the G3 Gen 3.</p><p>The former was announced in late 2023, before debuting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a> in early 2024. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gdc-2025-brings-about-new-qualcomm-chips-and-android-gaming-handhelds">Snapdragon G3 Gen 3</a> was introduced earlier this year at GDC 2025, with the Pocket S2 and Pocket S2 Pro being the first two devices to utilize the chip.</p><p>The logical conclusion I could come up with is that the Pocket DS was already deep into development before the G3 Gen 3 was announced. As such, the company likely decided to "stay the current course," instead of making any potential changes to accommodate a new SoC.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s44iabCTauJg3cm4aR4uPi" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-second-screen-software-features" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS second screen software features" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s44iabCTauJg3cm4aR4uPi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Unb9Ctp57AgExoUzLyb9Ri" name="ayaneo-pocket-ds-performance-explainer-banner" alt="AYANEO Pocket DS performance overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Unb9Ctp57AgExoUzLyb9Ri.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If that's the case, it would give AYANEO the flexibility to confirm that the Pocket DS is already in mass production. Usually, when a new AYANEO handheld is announced, it's at least a few months before it's actually released.</p><p>The decision to use the G3x Gen 2 might pay off in more ways than one, as we suspect (or hope) that the Pocket DS won't be too expensive. For reference, the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3-powered Pocket S2 starts at $499, with the S2 Pro coming in at $619.</p><p>Nevertheless, we'll be paying close attention to see exactly what AYANEO has planned for the price. There's already a sign-up page for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ds-world-s-1st-dual-screen-android-handheld/coming_soon">Indiegogo campaign</a>, so you can be notified once it's live. From there, we can only hope that the Pocket DS will land on our doorsteps before the 2025 holiday season is underway.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="787bc432-f637-4043-b7d8-43399c5505e4">            <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ds-world-s-1st-dual-screen-android-handheld/coming_soon" data-model-name="AYANEO Pocket DS" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GsG69ZKQWzU8vwQQd4qVNR.jpg' alt="AYANEO Pocket DS Square Product Render - Yellow "></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">AYANEO Pocket DS</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>With the AYANEO Pocket DS being officially introduced and the specs revealed, all we're waiting for now is price and availability.

These include the Pixel Watch 4, an official case for the Pixel 10 Pro, and a new color option for the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The new products are shown in Moonstone and Iris colorways, with the Pixel Watch 4 also appearing in Obsidian.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to come in 41mm and 45mm sizes, featuring a larger battery than the Pixel Watch 3 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">side-mounted charging system</a>.

Thankfully, we don’t have to wait too long, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-release-date">official unveiling</a> is just a few weeks away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Debuting with the Galaxy S25 series, Samsung brought this easy money transfer system to more of its phones in the U.S. All it takes is for users to bump their phone against their friend's or family member's phone to complete the transfer. While Tap to Transfer works with a variety of third-party digital wallets, you don't necessarily need one.</p><p>So long as the person you're trying to send money to has a physical debit card that's tap-to-pay ready, the feature will piggyback off its chip to complete the transfer. Additionally, you can send money to a friend from a distance if you've got their phone number handy.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung started rolling out the ability for users to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-now-lets-you-split-in-store-payments-into-installments">pay for items in installments</a> via the Wallet app. If you have an eligible Visa and Mastercard account, you can pay for chunky store payments in more comfortable, bite-sized pieces. The company states that when you're going to pay through Samsung Wallet, you should begin noticing a "Pay in installments" option. From there, you can pick the plan that works for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Overall, the analytics firm states Q2 2025 saw an 11% YoY (year over year) decline in smartphone shipments to 13.3 billion units. However, the highlight this time around is Google, as research shows the company's Pixel series has carried it into the top five this past quarter, placing it in fourth place.</p><p>Compared to the same time last year, Google's Pixel grew in the U.S., shipping 0.8 million units across the country. This brings Google into owning 3% of the market share for Q2. Overall (and speaking annually), Canalys states Google's Pixel has grown 13% in the U.S. market.</p><p>While Google has grown in the U.S. phone market share, it's still behind the likes of Apple, Samsung, and Motorola. Samsung reportedly shipped 8.3 million units in Q2 this year, amassing a whopping 38% annual growth with its Galaxy phones. Canalys researchers say this is "primarily driven" by its budget series, the Galaxy A line.</p><p>Motorola only saw a modest 2% growth in the U.S. while Apple saw an 11% dip.</p><h2 id="will-google-look-for-more-2">Will Google look for more?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-pixel-9-side-by-side-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to Pixel 9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o8Fi9zLSCe2rep8yKdQKuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Canalys highlights several issues that could hinder other OEMs in the U.S., such as "new requirements to local operations, uncertain tariff policies, and pressured demand."

Do you want magnets? Should it be a clear case? What level of drop-proofing would you like? Are there enough colorways available? Answer these questions before diving into the selection process. Once you've figured out whether you like minimalist or maximalist designs and where you stand on the thickness and impact resistance, you'll be ready to pick.</p><p>Believe it or not, but the first-party Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE / Flip 6 Silicone Case is a fantastic choice for your Flip 7 FE. You're guaranteed to get a perfect fit and top-notch quality. A year has passed since the case first launched, so the price has also dropped considerably. And as another bonus, you can choose from the bright springy colors of the Flip 6 series to liven up your dull <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy">black or white Flip 7 FE</a>. The ring protruding from the spine of this soft matte case gives you s comfortable grip on the folded Flip 7 FE. It's a handy little silicone case overall.</p><p>Thin cases are always in demand. If you're one of those who prefer extremely thin cases, then you should look at the Thinborne Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and Galaxy Z Flip 6 Case. This robust case has a really powerful magnetic ring baked into the back, yet it somehow measures only 0.04 inches wide. It's also incredibly lightweight, adds impact absorption, and comes with a cover display screen protector made of shatter-proof tempered glass. The only caveat here is the price, but I believe the high-quality make of the case more than makes up for it.</p><p>Once your Flip 7 FE's all decked out in the snazziest of cases, be sure to grab a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-screen-protectors">decent screen protector for it</a> too. Very few cases come with screen protectors, so it's best you purchase a kit separately.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Outside of this, Google is also introducing a new version, called "Veo 3 Fast." This Veo model is a little more lightweight for users looking to complete "work that requires rapid iteration and speed."</p><p>Veo 3 Fast is reportedly adept at generating and testing variations of a company's advertisements "quickly." This model can also create "video demonstrations" for your products based on the images you've provided. Additionally, Google states Veo Fast can create "engaging animated explainers" and even training material for new recruits.</p><p>The company speaks about Veo 3 Fast in the same vein as it does <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">Gemini 2.5 Flash</a>. Veo 3 Fast, while being lightweight, has reportedly struck a balance between fast processing times and strong visual quality output.</p><h2 id="google-s-veo-series-goes-further-2">Google's Veo series goes further</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DIUsf8X2DUY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google's Veo 3 Fast model is available in Vertex AI alongside the larger Veo 3 model. The post highlights some ways users can enjoy both AI video generators, such as more storytelling. In Vertex AI, users can set the scene, alongside any audio they'd like to include, all in a single prompt. If you have your characters speaking, Google says what you'd like them to say will be lip-synced, as well as any other background sounds you'd like to include.</p><p>On a related note, Veo 3 features native dialogue generation, which helps businesses "connect with an international audience." While Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast generate your video once, it will "localize the dialogue for dozens of languages."</p><p>All videos generated arrive in 1080p, giving users a little more confidence in their quality before showing it off.</p><p>Regarding that Veo 3 teaser, Google says that both models will receive an image-to-video generation feature in Vertex AI in August. We've seen this arrive a couple of times already through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">an update for Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">another for Google Photos</a>, both of which rolled out in July. Now, Veo 3 and Veo 3 Fast will have this feature available for users to experiment with, granting them an eight-second video clip based on the photo you've provided.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is because the Flip 7 FE is basically a re-released version of the last-gen foldable, with a few minor changes made to the insides.</p><p>Most smartphone accessory brands seem to have added the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-hands-on">Flip 7 FE</a>'s name next to pre-existing screen protectors for the Flip 6. This is understandable, considering both phones share the same displays — a 3.4-inch cover display and a 6.7-inch internal foldable display.

However,  only 469 high-level “Take Action” warnings were sent out before the first 7.8 magnitude quake.</p><p>It appears that Google's system miscalculated the tremors and sent a lower-level warning to 500,000 people, which is designed for "light shaking" and does not alert users with the same urgency.

This means that the alert system's predictions are becoming more accurate and closer to the actual magnitude of the earthquake. Furthermore, when Turkey was hit with a magnitude 6.2 earthquake in April 2025, the first alert was issued 8.0 seconds after the earthquake began.</p><p>"People who experienced moderate to strong shaking had a warning time of a few to 20 seconds.

Whether you’re cramming for exams, organizing a research project, or just trying to make sense of that dense PDF your professor uploaded, these new features might just save your sanity.</p><p>Google announced in a blog post that you can now ask about images directly, whether it's a diagram or slide for which you need a quick explanation. AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-search-call-around-agentic-gemini-2-5-pro-ai-mode-update">on mobile already does this</a>, and it’s finally landing on desktop too.</p><p>Furthermore, PDF uploads are on the way, so you’ll soon be able to drop in lecture notes or papers and ask questions on the spot.</p><h2 id="need-help-with-tough-topics-2">Need help with tough topics?</h2><p>Take a tricky psychology concept, for example. You can drop in a slide, and AI Mode will break it down for you, adding helpful context pulled from the web. You’ll get straight answers with links if you want to dive deeper. Google Drive support is also on the horizon, so grabbing files from your cloud stash will be easy.</p><p>Google is also adding something new to AI Mode called Canvas. Think of it as a side panel built to help you lay out messy information, whether you're planning study sessions, group projects, or even a trip.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VqzL4eSC6PxUhGRgNJAdrg" name="Google-AI-Mode" alt="New Canvas feature in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VqzL4eSC6PxUhGRgNJAdrg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2096" height="1179" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can also build and tweak your plans on the fly, pull in stuff from your files, and pick up right where you left off later.

It’s kind of like turning your phone into a live tutor. Just point your camera at something confusing, and Search will instantly respond with helpful information. It’s powered by Google Lens and tech from Project Astra.</p><p>To try it out, open Google Lens, tap the Live icon, and ask away. For now, it’s only on mobile and limited to users in the Labs experiment in the U.S.</p><p>Finally, Google Chrome is getting a new way to invoke Lens on the desktop with “Ask Google about this page.” Just clicking it from the address bar while viewing a website or PDF launches AI Overviews, giving you more insights on the page in question.

There were some great accessories on the market, but smartphone hardware wasn't ready yet.</p><p>That officially changed in 2025, when Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite mobile platform became truly capable for gaming and Wi-Fi 7 brought Ethernet-like speeds to Android phones.

There's no obnoxious RGB here — just a sleek design available in white or black colorways. You get subtle Razer branding on the top of the headband and on the ear caps, which are swappable and customizable. I tried the white one, but think the black version is slightly more low-key.</p><p>The advantage of this kind of style is that you can wear the BlackShark V3 Pro out and about without looking too strange. The headset's boom mic slots into the 3.5mm headphone jack and is detachable. When removed, the BlackShark V3 Pro can go undercover, blending in with all the other over-ear headphones out there.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8Jju7bG7QLnwS8sxgv28S4" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-4" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the leather headband." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Jju7bG7QLnwS8sxgv28S4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going back to the premium feel, the stitching on the leather headband looks and feels nice. The ear cushions are made of memory foam and are lined with a cloth cover, which is very comfortable. A leather or faux leather ear cushion might look more premium, but I think cloth makes more sense here, as it'll hold up better against sweat and will be easier to clean.</p><p>Rather than adjusting the fit of the BlackShark V3 Pro via the headband, you do it with a metal wire connecting to the ear cap and audio assembly. Once you get the hang of it, this feels easier and more natural than the typical adjustment methods.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RitDtRFxnV7enWKb2GMGZ4" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-5" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the metal adjustment slider." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RitDtRFxnV7enWKb2GMGZ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comfort is a big reason why I think you may be able to use BlackShark V3 Pro as your main pair of wireless headphones. They feel great to wear and the memory foam helps comfort even during long listening or gaming sessions. It's not <em>that</em> bulky, at least for a gaming headset.</p><p>The BlackShark V3 Pro weighs 367 grams, and that's less than the 385-gram <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a>, which are my baseline for comparing heavy headphones.

When you dive into the specs, it doesn't end up being all that surprising. Razer is using custom 50mm drivers with bio-cellulose diaphragms and larger magnets. That leads to big sound, better frequency separation, and improved sound imaging.</p><p>In other words, the BlackShark V3 Pro has the audio tech inside to produce great sound, whether you're gaming or listening to music. For gaming, these components make it easier to tell where an enemy is coming from, or hear a chest nearby. While listening to music, the benefits translate to creating a wide soundstage with a spatial feel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="w9JobVZ2bAQRfarTEh27L5" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-7" alt="The Razer BlackShark V3 Pro gaming headset laid atop records showing the customizable ear caps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w9JobVZ2bAQRfarTEh27L5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Active noise-canceling isn't going to beat headphones from Apple, Sony, and Bose, but it is more than serviceable on the BlackShark V3 Pro. I was able to cancel out planes flying over my balcony while using the BlackShark V3 Pro at half volume, which is all I really need. If you're trying to block out someone watching TV in the next room while you're gaming, this headset has you covered.</p><p>Ambient mode leaves a bit more to be desired. It lets in plenty of sound when the volume is low or there's no audio coming from your device. However, while gaming or listening to music, it's somewhat hard to hear the people around you even with ambient mode enabled. To be fair, ambient or transparency modes typically sound like this until you get into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones">ultra-premium sector of ANC earbuds and headphones</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ukXFfqp9Ca6QX8oQHnbNLC" name="Razer-BlackShark-V3-Pro-11" alt="The Razer Audio app showing BlackShark V3 Pro in the device list." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukXFfqp9Ca6QX8oQHnbNLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One thing I love about the BlackShark V3 Pro is how versatile the headset is for connectivity. You can connect the headset to your device wirelessly via Bluetooth, wired via USB or 3.5mm, or using a 2.4GHz receiver. Additionally, the BlackShark V3 Pro features dual connection with Bluetooth and 2.4GHz simultaneously. That means you can be gaming on your PC or console while streaming music from your phone and hear it all through the headset.</p><p>Best of all, the 3.5mm jack works in analog mode, meaning you can use it without powering on the headset.

We don't yet know when Samsung's next flagship tablets will actually arrive, but what if I told you there was an insane deal on a previous Galaxy Tab model?</p><p>The Galaxy Tab S9 might be almost two years old, but it's still the last flagship Android tablet from Samsung at this size.

And that was even before seeing that you could save up to $500 when trading in an old device and ordering from Samsung. </p><p>Price check: <a href="https://amazon.com/dp/B0C4BC6R95" target="_blank">$589 at Amazon</a> | <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-11-128gb-wi-fi-with-s-pen-graphite/6546661.p?skuId=6546661" target="_blank">$599 at Best Buy</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s9/buy/galaxy-tab-s9-128gb-beige-wi-fi-sm-x710nzeaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="f1383038-4812-4843-babd-c9e399237134" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799.99" data-dimension48="$799.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>✅ <strong>Recommended if:</strong> you want a powerful Galaxy Tab in a smaller form factor; you prefer Samsung devices but aren't a fan of the move to MediaTek; you don't care that the Tab S9 is almost two years old, because it's still going to get a few more major OS updates.</p><p>❌ <strong>Skip this deal if:</strong> you want the latest and most powerful Android tablet; you're concerned about Samsung's commitment to providing updates moving forward; you want a tablet that can pull double-duty as a laptop.</p><p>The more I think about the reasons why someone should pick up the Galaxy Tab S9, the more I'm surprised. Samsung ditched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">11-inch Galaxy Tab S10</a>, and while some rumors suggest it's making a return with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">Tab S11</a>, there's no guarantee of that yet. On top of that, the move to MediaTek was a surprising one considering Samsung's long-standing partnership with Qualcomm.</p><p>Although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">MediaTek chip</a> enables more power for on-device AI, those who are like me and enjoy retro emulation won't have the best time. However, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 in the Galaxy Tab S9 is the current "gold standard" for emulation, as there's excellent community support, and it's the SoC that many of the best emulators are tailored towards.</p><p>Besides that, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9</a> is just a great all around tablet anyways, with its 11-inch OLED panel, all-day battery, expandable storage, and a plethora of case options. Plus, you'll get an S Pen in the box, adding another layer of intrigue, as you won't need to spend more money just to get one.</p> ]]></dc:content>
