                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>There's no shortage of contenders if you want a good Android tablet, but most products tend to be quite large. Redmagic's Astra was the outlier, with the tablet touting a 9.06-inch OLED panel that made it a fabulous device. If anything, I've been on the lookout for a small Android tablet; we just moved to a new house, and I wanted to set up a smart home dashboard in my living room.</p><p>As much as I enjoy using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad/i-finally-used-the-ipad-mini-and-im-obsessed">iPad mini</a>, I wanted an Android tablet to run Home Assistant, and coincidentally, Xiaomi debuted the Pad Mini at just the right time. The tablet was unveiled alongside the 15T and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/xiaomi-15t-pro-review">15T Pro</a>, and I've been using it for the better part of two weeks now. Coming in at $429, the Pad Mini undercuts the iPad Mini, but that isn't anything new — Xiaomi has been doing this for over a decade now. The tablet is limited to select Southeast Asian countries, but it should make its way to other regions over the coming months.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4929px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5P4s9uKQUaEza78m4bkB2W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4929" height="2776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-is-a-convincing-ipad-air-clone-that-costs-half-as-much">Xiaomi Pad 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/xiaomi-pad-7-pro-review">Pad 7 Pro</a>, the Pad Mini has a metallic chassis with a minimalist design, and the smaller size makes it easier to use anywhere. Build quality is good, and while the grey variant I'm using doesn't stand out visually, I'm glad Xiaomi didn't go overboard with the design.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="NNSN9ik2ipYeV2x3f3smpV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NNSN9ik2ipYeV2x3f3smpV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pad Mini has flat sides, but there are subtle bevels that make it easy to hold and use, and at 326g, it is light enough that there aren't any problems in this area. It is heavier than the iPad mini, but you're also getting a bigger panel. The bezels are chunkier than most phones, but they're uniform.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="u8PeJkwsKZFF3oer3AyBCW" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8PeJkwsKZFF3oer3AyBCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking about the panel, the 8.8-inch IPS LCD goes up to 165Hz, and that feels like overkill. What's great is that the interface is fluid, and I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever in the two weeks I used the Pad Mini. The 3K resolution of 3008 x 1880 is plenty adequate, and the tablet is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400+ platform — the same as the Xiaomi 15T Pro. Clearly, there's no shortage of power, and the few games I played on the Pad Mini ran without any issues.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WEqg5oieRtYgGCrYBZmpLV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEqg5oieRtYgGCrYBZmpLV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm using the 12GB/512GB variant of the Pad Mini, but it is also available in an 8GB/256GB configuration. It's good to see Xiaomi using UFS 4.1 storage modules on the tablet, and it gets a sizeable 7,500mAh battery that comfortably delivers over 10 hours of screen time without any problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CCJVWsbL3pDjWym62rjFjU" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CCJVWsbL3pDjWym62rjFjU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 8.8-inch panel has vibrant colors and is calibrated well, and as is the case with most Xiaomi products, you get a good amount of customizability. What I like the most is that Xiaomi's reading mode is intact, allowing you to turn the screen monochrome; this gives the Pad Mini a distinct advantage over the iPad mini when reading ebooks on the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V95Pgtcyz2y5UQEj9azKuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another differentiator is the side-mounted USB-C port. The Pad Mini has the usual USB-C connector at the bottom, but you get a secondary port on the left side, and this makes it doubly convenient to charge the tablet when you're using it. Xiaomi also bundles a 67W charger in the box — unlike the 15T Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="kXHKkEYR4uvytDAFQoPjYQ" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kXHKkEYR4uvytDAFQoPjYQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's delightful to use the Pad Mini; the small tablet is easy to hold one-handed, and the panel has good color vibrancy and excellent brightness. It's just as good to stream HDR content as it is to browse, and the stereo sound makes a difference while watching videos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zqmd4vJsNkjdy3nnTvpdjV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zqmd4vJsNkjdy3nnTvpdjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi has two accessories designed to be used with the Pad Mini; the Xiaomi Focus Pen is identical to what you get with the Pad 7 and 7 Pro, and it is a decent stylus that lets you jot notes and doodle. It had buttons that allow you to easily annotate or start taking notes in Mi Canvas.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="K4LcrBtynevqEoeYsrvUuV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K4LcrBtynevqEoeYsrvUuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's all thanks to the Xiaomi Pad Mini Cover that I'm able to use the Pad Mini as my smart home controller. The case has a band at the back with integrated rivets, and it lets you hold the tablet a little better. But where it excels is as a kickstand; allowing you to put the Pad Mini on a desk or table and use it.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZFsrTqnjmMqca4WBfAotnW" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZFsrTqnjmMqca4WBfAotnW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dcsrXSZDkFWTCKYtoA6NbV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dcsrXSZDkFWTCKYtoA6NbV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yvgtuPEmBgKcJqybLpNLGV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yvgtuPEmBgKcJqybLpNLGV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The cover makes a huge difference when it comes to the usability of the tablet, and it is the sole reason I'm using the Pad Mini instead of the Redmagic Astra as my smart home controller. Elsewhere, the software is identical to what you get on Xiaomi's phones, and just like the 15T and 15T Pro, you miss out on Android 16 — it's still running Android 15.</p><p>While that is annoying, it's clear that Xiaomi has no intentions to roll out the latest software on its devices. That said, the UI itself is fluid, and for what I need to do on a tablet, the Pad Mini has all the features I need.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="5Aa6muengefDQkSJGZLcsV" name="Xiaomi Pad Mini" alt="Xiaomi Pad Mini review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Aa6muengefDQkSJGZLcsV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you like the look of the iPad mini but want Android instead, the Pad Mini is the answer. Xiaomi's latest tablet nails the hardware, and the small tablet is a delight to use. The affordability combined with decent accessories gives it an edge over other Android tablets in this category, and I can't recommend it highly enough.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With active noise cancellation, a wild 100-hour battery claim, modular parts, and high-resolution audio support, it feels like CMF wants to shake up the under-$100 headphone category.</p><p>The design stands out immediately. Instead of glossy touch controls, the Headphone Pro uses a multifunction roller for volume, playback, and noise cancellation. There's also an 'Energy Slider' to adjust bass and treble on the fly, without needing an app. This setup is similar to what Nothing used in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/nothing-headphone-1-review">Headphone 1</a>.</p><h2 id="modular-approach-2">Modular approach</h2><p>There’s also a customizable button that you can program for specific shortcuts. The headphones are modular too, with swappable ear cushions that come in multiple colors like bright orange and light green, adding both comfort and personality. Replacement pads cost around $25, making it easy to freshen them up or change the look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1497px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97" name="CMF-Headphone-Pro-on-head" alt="CMF Headphone Pro worn over head" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9FmokWwpNtjB2erPWiEY97.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1497" height="842" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Under the hood, CMF isn’t cutting corners. The Headphone Pro uses 40mm dynamic drivers with nickel-plated diaphragms and a 16.5mm copper coil inside a dual-chamber setup, all aimed at reducing distortion and widening the soundstage. They’re Hi-Res Audio certified and support LDAC for high-bitrate wireless streaming, while also offering a 3.5mm wired option.</p><p>A “Personal Sound” feature fine-tunes the EQ based on your ear shape and hearing profile. As for noise cancellation, CMF promises hybrid adaptive ANC with up to 40dB reduction that automatically adjusts depending on your environment.</p><h2 id="monster-battery-life-2">Monster battery life</h2><p>Battery life might be the headline feature: with ANC off, you get up to 100 hours of playback. Even with ANC on, CMF claims an impressive 50 hours, which is more than enough to cover a week’s worth of commutes or long-haul flights.</p><p>Charging is fast as well. A 5-minute charge gives you about 4 hours of playback, and a full charge takes around two hours with USB-C. If needed, you can also charge the headphones directly from your smartphone using a USB-C to USB-C cable.</p><p>Connectivity checks most boxes you’d expect in 2025: Bluetooth 5.4, multipoint pairing, Fast Pair for Android, Swift Pair for Windows, and full iOS support. That versatility makes it easier to switch between devices. For call quality, the headphones include an AI noise reduction system to cut down on background noise during conversations.</p><p>The CMF Headphone Pro comes in dark gray, light gray, and light green, with ear cushion colors to mix things up. They’re available now in Europe and the UK, while U.S. buyers will have to wait until October 7, 2025.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is especially true now that microSD cards are practically non-existent on even the best Android phones. However, thanks to external SSDs like the K20 Mini from ORICO, you can quickly offload pictures or videos in a snap, and ahead of Amazon's 'Big Deal Days' event, the 1TB version is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/"><strong>on sale for under $100</strong></a>.</p><p>In recent months, you might have noticed more of these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/practically-all-of-the-best-android-phones-are-hindered-by-this-one-dumb-thing">portable SSD solutions</a> tailored to phones begin appearing. As someone who is constantly testing different emulators or trying to offload pictures, having a slim and lightweight <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/storage/aiffro-external-ssd-delightfully-different">portable SSD</a> has been absolutely divine. But there are a few other features of the ORICO K20 Mini that I've been rather enjoying, least of which is the built-in MagSafe compatibility.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day returns October 7th - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD" name="orico-k20-mini-square-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TJ4RSKLiJXoLkTzQViTJD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: </strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$109.99</del> <strong>$99.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The days of your phone featuring a microSD are long gone, and have been for quite some time. However, accessories like the K20 Mini from ORICO look to pick up the mantle, and for less than $100, this is a must have for just about everyone.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d2742f31-01eb-4e7a-b14a-f567b47ebc44" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension48="ORICO 1TB Magnetic External SSD: $109.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You want a quick and easy way to expand your phone's storage, without solely needing to rely on your phone's internal storage and/or the cloud.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You like the idea of what the K20 Mini offers, but it's still just a bit too expensive for your budget.</p><p>Until recently, the only way I could reliably use the K20 Mini with Android phones was to either use a MagSafe case or to slap an adapter to the back of a non-MagSafe case. Thankfully, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> lineup has mostly arrived (we're still waiting on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>), which includes the necessary magnets to use these kinds of accessories without needing adapters. Hopefully, other companies will soon follow suit, but at least there are workarounds at my disposal.</p><p>In addition to the ultra slim design, the K20 Mini is also fairly rugged thanks to its Aluminum Alloy shell that doesn't interfere with your phone's signal, while also being able to withstand a few bumps and bruises. Plus, ORICO's portable SSD can reach up to 2,000MB/s transfer speeds and includes a compatible cable in the box.</p><p>ORICO offers the K20 Mini in three different sizes, ranging from 512GB to 2TB, but for just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Magnetic-External-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B0DNMTKFN7/">under $100</a>, the 1TB offers the best bang for the buck of the trio. We suspect this deal won't last forever, so if you're you want something to help you forget about wanting a microSD card slot, take the K20 Mini for a spin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The device will be extremely comfortable to hold, thanks to the large, rounded "golden corners," the post added.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vFh4ssPAyUrp36DCDkhBA6" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 Sand Storm" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vFh4ssPAyUrp36DCDkhBA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"Aerospace-grade toughness arrives through a high-voltage plasma process that grows a ceramic coating directly on the metal frame - 3.4 times harder than aluminum mid frame and 1.3 times as tough as titanium mid frame," the Chinese OEM added.

Add in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">S25 Edge</a> and the newest S25 FE, and you have something for everyone.</p><p>Samsung's Galaxy phones offer one thing consistently: <strong>performance</strong>. You might not like some of the features or a few things about the way they look and feel, but when a phone gets the "Galaxy" name, it is Samsung's best-in-class offering. Both the small Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 FE fit the bill here. They're damn fine phones.</p><p>But they do have their differences. Here's what the standard Galaxy S25 simply does better.</p><p><strong>It has a much better display</strong>. I'm starting here because this is the most important difference. The S25 FE has a good screen, a 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED panel. The regular Galaxy S25, though, has one that's better; it's denser, so it will look clearer, it's brighter, and it has full HDR support. These differences might sound minor, but the display is what you're looking at 100% of the time you're using your phone. Nothing is more important than the display.</p><p><strong>The chip is better</strong>. The Galaxy S25 comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm SM8750-AB, the Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The FE uses a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-exynos-2400-comeback">Samsung Exynos 2400 S5E9945</a>. Both are more than powerful enough to do all your phone things, but the Snapdragon makes a big difference when it comes to battery life and network connectivity. If you're into benchmarks, the Snapdragon destroys the Exynos, too.</p><p><strong>It has a better camera system</strong>. The telephoto lens on the standard S25 is a better piece of hardware, offering a higher zoom and better focal length. If you want to stand back and zoom in, you'll see the difference.</p><p><strong>The fingerprint scanner is better</strong>. A small nitpick that really bothers me. I hate in-screen sensors, but the S25 FE uses an optical sensor while the standard version uses an ultrasonic variant.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-s-great-about-the-s25-fe"><span>What's great about the S25 FE</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BHuZTijDCu3hRigV5AUKZF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The S25 FE has a few things you won't find on the standard version, even though it's a little cheaper. The most notable features and specs:</p><p><strong>It's bigger</strong>. At one time, every company was trying to make phones as tiny as they could. Not today! For a lot of people, a bigger phone is better, and the FE is big without being too big. A 6.7-inch·2340x1080px display is the sweet spot for a lot of folks, and the FE nails it when it comes to size.</p><p><strong>The battery</strong>. It's bigger, almost 20% bigger. The FE has a 4,900 mAh battery compared to the 4,000 mAh battery on the standard S25. While the more efficient Qualcomm chip on the standard S25 means it doesn't last longer most of the time, the FE's extra capacity is the reason why. That's rare to see when comparing an Exynos phone to a Qualcomm phone, so the extra battery was a great choice.</p><p><strong>The update cycle. </strong>The FE ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and will get seven years of updates. Since the original S25 debuted so much earlier, it shipped with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> and also gets 7 years of updates. When all the dust settles, the FE <em>could</em> get one extra platform update because of when it was released.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>You're going to be happy with either of these phones. They are very similar to each other when it comes to features and performance, but the regular S25 has just a bit more to offer.</p><p>I like the better display on the standard S25, and when it comes to network operability, the Qualcomm chip means the standard S25 is not only faster at transferring wireless data, but also has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/wi-fi-7-is-here-but-should-you-care">Wi-Fi 7</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/explaining-5g-millimeter-wave-sub-6-low-band-and-other-terms-you-need-know">mmWave support</a>, and can connect to more FDD, TDD, and 3G fallback bands that you won't find on the FE. Depending on where you are, this might make a big difference.</p><p>The FE has a bigger display, enough battery power to make it last as long as the regular version (a big win for an Exynos chip!), and charges faster. <strong>More importantly, both phones charge safely.</strong> Samsung learned its lesson and offers the safest methods available when it comes to refueling your battery, since we're monkeys who always <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-is-it-safe-to-use-my-phone-while-im-charging-it">make bad decisions</a>, that matters. 🐵</p><p>I would spend the extra few dollars on the regular S25 because I care about the display quality more than the other differences. But really, this is a toss-up. You'll pay more for the standard S25, but it's worth every penny. So is the FE. Grab either and you're good.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HT3UJuEYWHiCkgRjmm34j6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1WWG4M?tag=hawk-future-20&linkCode=ogi&th=1&ascsubtag=ac-us-5476547492718419391-20" target="_blank" data-dimension112="13ddd301-2157-4ac8-a1b2-3dd08d9f30ce" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE 128GB: $650 at Amazon" data-dimension25=""><strong>$650 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Galaxy FE series was designed so that smartphone fans could get the best bang for their buck from Samsung.

The company is calling this an "early preview" of the feature, as its rollout begins for all users. Vibes starts out as a simple feed where you can view videos created by others using its AI software. However, as time goes on, and you begin viewing more videos, Meta states this Vibes feed will become "personalized."</p><p>In Vibes, users will have a few options, such as starting from the basis of their own ideas. Meta states users can create an AI-generated video using content they have. Additionally, if you're digging the Vibes, you can "remix" a video someone else has had the AI create, and make it something different. Before remixing, Meta will deliver a pop-up menu with the following options: Add Music, Change Image, and Change Animation.</p><p>The possibilities right now in Vibes may seem a little basic, but Meta states it's working to improve those options and possibilities. It plans to roll out more "powerful creation tools" in the future.</p><p>Once you're satisfied with your remix, or even your personal idea, users can post it on the Vibes feed. Similarly, you can share your AI-generated video with others through DMs and cross-post that content to your Instagram or Facebook Stories or Reels.</p><p>As Vibe rolls out in the app, Meta states you can also access this new feed via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://meta.ai/"><u>meta.ai</u></a>, as well.</p><h2 id="vibes-joins-discover-2">Vibes joins Discover</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:691px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:86.83%;"><img id="bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH" name="meta-ai-app-remix-restyle-launch" alt="The Meta AI app rolls out a new "Vibes" feed, packed full of AI-generated videos other have created, as well as a "remix" option that lets you change what others have done." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bvR5H6RAdpbfycd8tvWSLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="691" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta also highlights that its app is capable of working well with its AI glasses, meaning it'll pair well with those new, "enhanced" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-hands-on-impressions">Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses</a>.</p><p>Meta's continued focus on the AI app being a useful tool for its AI smartglasses goes hand-in-hand with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">the app's original launch</a> earlier this year. In short, the "Meta AI app" was essentially a rebranded Meta View app for its glasses. With this rebrand, anyone with a Facebook or Meta account could interact with its Llama 4 model for questions. It opened up the door for regular users without a pair of smartglasses to still utilize Meta's AI capabilities.</p><p>This Vibes feed is like the video version of the app's original Discover feed, which hosts prompts that others have created and shared. Similar to that feed, users can, of course, "remix" those prompts (like videos) and turn them into something that's yours.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This members-only sale event is expected to showcase some of the best tech deals of the year, but take note: unlike last July&apos;s four-day Prime Day, this sale is only set to run for 48 hours. </p><h2 id="what-google-pixel-deals-should-i-look-for-during-prime-day-2">What Google Pixel deals should I look for during Prime Day?</h2><p>Prime Day generally showcases the best discounts on newer devices while ignoring most last-gen stuff. This means you should expect to see a ton of great deals on the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, and Pixel 10 Pro XL. It&apos;s also worth mentioning that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Google Pixel Watch 4</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> are scheduled for release on October 9th (one day after the sale ends), so we could see some updated incentives to preorder. </p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-2">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>Yes! Like all Prime Day sale events, Big Deal Days is exclusive to Prime members. If you haven&apos;t joined yet, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of a membership without paying a cent. </p><p>Alternatively, if you&apos;d simply rather not shop at Amazon, be aware that the retailer&apos;s biggest competitors - such as Best Buy and Walmart - are expected to launch their own rival sale events at the same time. These stores typically match Amazon&apos;s prices without requiring any sort of membership. </p> ]]></dc:content>

There are several aspects of Bluetooth that make it an excellent choice for wirelessly connecting a wide range of devices, including audio gear. It's versatile, compatible, and continues to evolve, gaining new features with each iteration, such as Bluetooth 6 and Low Energy (LE) Audio.</p><p>However, there are a few notable limitations that come with using Bluetooth for audio playback on headphones, earbuds, and speakers. Two big ones are range and quality. The average range for common Bluetooth devices (Class 2) is about 33 feet, which isn't much and can be shortened by interference, digital or physical, like walls or floors. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio">attaining lossless quality for music</a> over Bluetooth is near impossible, though emerging codecs like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">AptX Lossless</a> are trying to make it a reality.</p><p>That raises an important question: should we focus on improving Bluetooth or switch to Wi-Fi? Qualcomm is a company that's doing both, developing AptX Lossless over Bluetooth <em>and</em> working on XPAN (Expanded Personal Area Network) over Wi-Fi. It's exciting, but Sonos has been doing Wi-Fi on its speakers for years, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> announced XPAN years ago.</p><p>So, where is Wi-Fi for consumer audio gear, like headphones and earbuds? It's a complex situation, but the future looks bright.</p><h2 id="why-we-need-wi-fi-over-bluetooth-and-how-it-works-2">Why we need Wi-Fi over Bluetooth (and how it works)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU" name="Sonos-Ace-both-colors.jpg" alt="Sonos Ace headphones in black and soft white." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99856VeUPkeNYDJPT9VRKU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Sonos fans expected its Ace headphones to support Wi-Fi like its speakers, but that didn't happen.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many casual audio enthusiasts wonder why Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds haven't gained popularity yet, as evidenced by numerous <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/xemeqs/do_wifi_headsets_exist_if_yes_are_they_any_good/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/1cxdn6n/why_wifi_headphones_probably_werent_on_the_table/" target="_blank">threads</a>. After all, Wi-Fi speakers are very much a thing, and Sonos has a robust ecosystem of them. Taking that technology and applying it to headphones and earbuds should be easy, right? Well, not exactly.</p><p>The perceived simplicity of this goal usually comes from a misunderstanding of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos work</a>. When connecting a pair of Bluetooth headphones to your phone, it's your smartphone that streams the music from a service and then separately beams it to those headphones. Your phone is talking to a streaming service over Wi-Fi or data (or playing downloaded content), and subsequently shares the audio with a wireless device over Bluetooth.</p><p>That's not how Wi-Fi speakers like Sonos operate. In this scenario, your phone effectively becomes a remote control for your Sonos speaker, which independently streams music from a service over Wi-Fi. That's how you can remotely control playback on Sonos speakers from across the world, whereas you typically need to be within 33 feet to maintain a Bluetooth connection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU" name="Sonos-Ace-app-home-theater.jpg" alt="Sonos app showing Ace headphones swap with Sonos Arc." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zX7NLohYdhCNapzeoVaFqU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To apply this technology to headphones and earbuds, these consumer audio products must be able to connect to Wi-Fi networks and stream audio independently of an intermediary device, such as a smartphone. That's tricky, because you'd need to cram extra hardware into smaller devices. It might be why Sonos' first pair of headphones, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a>, opted for Bluetooth instead of Wi-Fi, unlike the rest of the ecosystem.</p><p>But Wi-Fi has clear advantages over Bluetooth, which is why many audiophiles crave it. The connectivity protocol effectively removes the range limits of Bluetooth — with enough networking hardware and access points, Wi-Fi earbuds could work anywhere that receives your network's signal — and adds high-fidelity audio.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-s-xpan-technology-brings-wi-fi-audio-2">Qualcomm's XPAN technology brings Wi-Fi audio</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH" name="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro" alt="Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YLeJjrVdDsNpV49VeYvXYH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro are Qualcomm XPAN earbuds you can buy today.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This technology isn't a fever-dream; it's real and available now in the form of Qualcomm XPAN. It's available on select headphones and earbuds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/xiaomi-buds-5-pro-sound-qualcomm-xpan">like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro</a>, and extends the range typically provided by Bluetooth by adding your home Wi-Fi network. In practice, it means your buds won't cut out if you walk too far away from your Bluetooth device, since they'll fall back to Wi-Fi.</p><p>Built upon the Snapdragon Sound platform and the S7 series of chips, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/problem-with-qualcomm-s7-sound-xpan-tech">Qualcomm XPAN</a> is trying to make Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds mainstream. There's a long road ahead, but the first consumer audio products to support XPAN were released this year, including the Buds 5 Pro.</p><p>Aside from the extended range, Qualcomm XPAN offers higher-fidelity audio by leveraging a Wi-Fi connection. The mode's maximum quality is 96kHz/24-bit, which is higher than CD-quality. In other words, XPAN technology and supported devices like the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro deliver <em>true</em> wireless lossless audio beyond what conventional Bluetooth offers.</p><p>While 96kHz/24-bit is something you can use with XPAN today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/headphones/wi-fi-wireless-earbuds-with-24-bit-hi-res-audio-are-coming-very-soon-confirms-qualcomm" target="_blank">the future is 24-bit/192kHz lossless audio</a>.

The extra hardware needed to make it work could be expensive or open an entirely new can of worms on the research and development side. Plus, using Wi-Fi consumes more battery than Bluetooth, especially when compared to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio">new standards like LE Audio</a>.</p><p>Mainstream earbuds and headphones with Wi-Fi support would need extra chips, a solution to the battery life problem, <em>and </em>a solution to the compatibility problem. While almost everything supports Bluetooth audio these days, Wi-Fi audio compatibility would need to be built from the ground up. For instance, you need a supported phone like the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> to get the full 96Hz/24-bit audio of XPAN.</p><p>Even technologies like Qualcomm XPAN use a mix of Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, rather than streaming audio directly over Wi-Fi, like Sonos speakers do. This helps Qualcomm address the battery life problem that would plague true Wi-Fi headphones.</p><p>The hybrid approach, combined with larger internal batteries — the Wi-Fi version of Xiaomi's Buds 5 Pro has a 64mAh battery compared to the 53mAh capacity of the Bluetooth version — helps Qualcomm deliver the same or better battery life as Bluetooth earbuds.</p><p>We haven't seen Wi-Fi headphones and earbuds go mainstream due to technical limitations and compatibility issues, but that might be changing as emerging standards like Qualcomm's XPAN continue to grow.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are pros and cons to choosing either brand, and I've tested the latest features from both Gemini and Galaxy AI. It's clear to me that, if getting the best AI features on your phone is your top priority, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series is the one to go with.</p><p>That's not to say that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a> is doing anything worse than the Galaxy S25 — it's just a numbers game. Google is very generous, gifting its best AI features to other Android and iOS devices, whereas Samsung's Galaxy AI suite is exclusive to its own devices. If you use a Galaxy S25, you're still getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">multimodal Gemini Live</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/circle-to-search-gains-real-time-translation">Circle to Search</a>, and AI editing tools in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>. Access to <em>both</em> Google AI and Galaxy AI is a major plus for the Galaxy S25.</p><p>That's partly why I'm intrigued by a Verizon deal that claims to give away a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> for free, which sounds too good to be true. In some ways, it is — you have to add a line on the Unlimited Ultimate or Unlimited Plus plans.

Starting with feature availability, devices like the Galaxy S25 have access to Galaxy AI and Gemini, which is an impressive combination. You probably know all about what Gemini can do, but you should also be aware of the great things Samsung is doing on the AI front.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Bar and Brief</a> are both designed to use AI to put relevant items in front of you whenever you need them — think something like an AI-powered version of Apple's Live Activities and Dynamic Island, but for the Galaxy S25 series. These features are neat, but they heavily depend on whether you use supported services, like Samsung apps or Google Maps.</p><p>I find that the simpler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> tools are more handy, like Object Eraser and Audio Eraser, which perform better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-magic-eraser-non-pixel-phones">Magic Eraser and Audio Magic Eraser</a> on the Google side of things. Additionally, if you're into wearables, Galaxy AI powers a daily Energy Score and Sleep Score with a Galaxy Ring or Watch. This is especially great when you consider these health insights are completely free, whereas Google has some Pixel Watch features behind a Fitbit Premium subscription.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ" name="Galaxy-S25-On-Device-AI" alt="The 'process data only on device' page in Samsung settings." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KJrf2twULD4748vqe4wCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Best of all, Samsung has the hardware and software needed to deliver a private and secure experience.

Before you get sucked into the hype of a "free" phone, especially one as good as the Galaxy S25, review the fine print. In this case, be aware that you need to add a line, upgrade, or keep an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan to get the deal.</p><p>The savings that cut the entire retail price of the Galaxy S25 or S25 Plus down to $0 are applied as bill credits over the course of 36 months. If you cancel, switch plans, or upgrade early, you'll be on the hook for the remainder of the phone's cost.</p><p>That might sound scary, but it doesn't have to be, if you know what you're getting. With an Unlimited Plus or Unlimited Ultimate plan, you get unlimited talk, text, and data, plus extra perks like mobile hotspot and 5G UW support. Those who already need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cell-phone-plans" target="_blank">great wireless plan</a> can get one at Verizon while also snagging a free Galaxy S25 in the process.</p> ]]></dc:content>

By early 2025, when I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">ran a half-marathon wearing them</a>, they barely lasted two hours. Having a strong Gen 2 baseline will be important to Gen 1 owners, who know the capacity will fade with time, as well as first-time buyers.</p><p>So far, the Gen 2s use up about 20% capacity per hour, including one 3K video, frequent Meta AI commands, and high-volume music streaming to combat outdoor ambience. A two-hour run left me at 60% capacity, while a one-hour run the next day left me at 79%.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-selfie" alt="Selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses, sitting indoors on a couch." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CFvRdWFjeKiD2zFcPY3PRg.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2939px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-on-face-close-up" alt="A selfie of Michael Hicks wearing the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K5MQhw73QZzQAo93XyvQsi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2939" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses are notably thicker. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Using them indoors at a lower volume, with Meta AI commands turned off to conserve power, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s were at 69% after two hours — very efficient! Then, a two-minute phone call and filming my cat in 3K for another minute cut another 8% power, so take that into account.</p><p>I don't believe you could consistently use these for all-day audio streaming, unless you're willing to take them off once or twice for a quick top-off in the charging case. But it's <em>much</em> better than before, and the 50% recharge in 20 minutes helps.</p><p>Overall, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 battery boost makes me much more likely to wear them for an outing or work event, knowing they won't become a pointless face-weight after a couple of hours.</p><h2 id="these-glasses-don-t-feel-that-different-but-they-ll-keep-changing-2">These glasses don't feel THAT different, but they'll keep changing</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-clear-lenses" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Clear lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDszqCnswZ962HxvpXjyqD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Around the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a> launch in late October, Meta will push several new updates to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s: slow motion and hyperlapse videos, Garmin/ Strava integration for real-time workout stats, "conversation focus" mode to enhance the voice of whomever you're speaking with, and new voice command shortcuts like "Photo" without the Meta AI wake word.</p><p>Meta has also promised that the Ray-Ban Gen 2s will be able to shoot in 1200p resolution at 60 FPS, but the option isn't available yet. Meta has even opened up its "Wearable Device Access Toolkit" so that devs can integrate Meta AI glasses directly with their third-party apps — but we probably won't see the results until 2026 or later.</p><p>Aside from battery life, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2s don't feel <em>that</em> different today. But all of the above features make me optimistic that they'll feel more "next-gen" soon.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBL0acIBb2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>On that note, even though the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses offer "over 2x more pixels" than the last generation for video recording, the difference doesn't feel that stark. You can notice more details and less compression in side-by-side videos if you look closely, at least.</p><p>But Nick, who tested the identical cameras on the Oakley Meta HSTNs, agrees with me that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">image stabilization is fantastic at 1080p</a>, creating a super-smooth, gliding video while running fast that almost recreates the effect of a dolly shot in movies. So I find myself preferring that mode; maybe the 1200p 60FPS mode will feel like a nice, smoother compromise between the two, once that arrives.</p><p>Honestly, I just wish we'd seen a <em>photo</em> quality boost, as well. The unchanged 3024 X 4032 resolution is still great in ideal conditions, but I'd still like to see better low-light quality, color balancing that's not quite so oversaturated, or some kind of optical zoom (if that's feasible in glasses form) when the Gen 3s arrive in a couple of years.</p><h2 id="the-cons-and-nitpicks-that-you-ll-have-to-live-with-2">The cons and nitpicks that you'll have to live with</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-vs-normal-glasses" alt="Photo of normal Warby Parker glasses sitting atop Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses on a blue-and-white patterned blanket." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wShPAtdgs2J5UNDwjCwYig.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">My normal Warby Parker glasses compared to my Ray-Ban Wayfarers. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my last Ray-Bans, I wore a "Large" pair that put less pressure on my face but wasn't well-fitted, so it slid down my face while walking (or running, especially). With this pair, I got the Standard size, and now they stay firmly in place for a ten-mile run, no matter how sweaty I get.</p><p><em>That's</em> great, but now that I'm wearing them on consecutive days instead of sporadic weekends, the better fit also puts more pressure on my nose bridge and ears. Even though the Gen 2s only weigh about 2g more — a fair trade-off for the battery boost — not everyone will enjoy that extra weight for long-term wear.</p><p>The design blends in <em>much</em> better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> glasses, and I like their style more than the Oakley HSTNs, but not everyone will agree with me. For example, my fiancée isn't a fan, whether on her face or mine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-case-and-meta-ai-app-01" alt="Transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with transitions lenses next to the glasses charging case and the Meta AI app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R5o9nw4m9dhUbPkewwjrS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta AI can be undeniably helpful for on-the-go questions, live translations, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Live AI</a>. But I'd like it to be better at answering questions about the glasses themselves, such as telling me what video resolution is active or what the touchpad shortcuts are, rather than telling me where to look for myself. And I hear the response "I can't help with that, but I'm learning more every day!" if I ask it to do anything too complicated, such as "Take a 15-second video."</p><p>The integrations with current music and messaging apps are pretty good, if a bit slow to work; I could call certain contacts or pull up a specific music playlist or song if I remembered the name. But Meta is working at a disadvantage compared to future Samsung or Apple glasses that'll have closer system integration with your phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="J86zomLo98pMYcqdEAnYyc" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-graphite" alt="Graphite Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses on display from a side view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J86zomLo98pMYcqdEAnYyc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Gen 2s deliver rich audio, but not noticeably improved from last generation, and you typically need to turn it up to higher volumes. The real issue, though, is the audio bleed: My fiancée confirmed she can hear a song's melody at about 50% volume and can clearly make out the lyrics at higher volumes. These glasses aren't best suited for open-space offices.</p><p>I've been spoiled by my open-ear <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review">Shokz OpenFit 2 earbuds</a>, which look much dorkier but have more targeted sound that goes directly into your ears for less bleed, along with several modes like bass boost, voice, or Dolby Audio to customize the sound to your tastes.

The Wayfarer style comes in basic colors like black and blue, with various colored lenses available.</p><p>If you want a more stylish statement piece, the Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) is the style to opt for. Skyler's frame is shaped like trendy cat eye frames, giving the wearer flair and charm. The colorways for Ray-Ban Meta Skyler (Gen 2) are the most diverse, with the suave Shiny Mystic Violet frame taking the crown as the best-looking variant. This shade comes with a Clear to Amethyst Transitions lens color, adding even more character overall.</p><p>Alternatively, if you want to look like you stepped out of the 70s, the Ray-Ban Meta Headliner (Gen 2) style is hard to beat. This pair has a chunky, thick, very pronounced look with quite a circular curve to the shape of the lenses. Apart from basic black with matte or shiny finishes, Headliner also comes in a warm Shiny Asteroid Grey colorway and lenses with Clear to Emerald Transitions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s not <em>officially</em> recognized as a clinical disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), but its symptoms and effects mirror those of other behavioral addictions, and many health care professionals recognize this.</p><p>Reading through material on the web, these are often indicators of smartphone addiction:</p><p><strong>Preoccupation:</strong> Constantly thinking about your phone, even when not using it.<br><strong>Tolerance:</strong> Needing to use your phone for increasingly longer periods to feel satisfied.<br><strong>Withdrawal Symptoms:</strong> Experiencing anxiety, irritability, restlessness, or depression when unable to use your phone.<br><strong>Loss of Control:</strong> Repeated unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control smartphone use.<br><strong>Negative Consequences:</strong> Continued use despite knowing it's causing problems in relationships, work, school, or physical health.<br><strong>Sacrifice of Activities:</strong> Giving up important social, occupational, or recreational activities because of smartphone use.<br><strong>Deception:</strong> Lying to family or friends about the extent of your smartphone use.<br><strong>Mood Alteration:</strong> Using your phone to escape problems or relieve feelings of helplessness, guilt, anxiety, or depression.</p><p>It's important to distinguish between heavy smartphone use and addiction. Many use their phones extensively for work or social connections <em>without</em> experiencing negative impacts. The critical difference lies in the loss of control and the resulting impairment in daily functioning.</p><p>Like alcohol or gambling, it's so much of a "normal" thing that it can ruin your life. And if you're affected, you probably can't "fix" it alone.</p><h2 id="who-can-be-affected-2">Who Can Be Affected?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T" name="Apple-Park-indoors" alt="A crowd of people inside a building at Apple Park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QXr3QgtMPXjA8o9CKme62T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nabila Popal / IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The reality is that <strong>anyone</strong> who uses a smartphone can potentially develop problematic usage patterns. However, certain factors may increase vulnerability.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6133055/">Adolescents and young adults</a> are still developing and face immense social and peer pressure. Often accompanied by FOMO (fear of missing out) and a need for validation, this can make a smartphone feel more important than it should be.</p><p>Folks with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9902510/">low self-esteem or other existing mental health conditions</a> often use their phone as a way to cope or escape, or even as a distraction from stress. This can deepen the reliance on the phone for comfort.</p><p>People who are otherwise isolated or feel like they are may turn to a phone as a lifeline to the "real world". I can totally understand this, as my physical health issues sometimes keep me indoors and feeling alone for a week or more. It's tough.</p><p>I'm far from being a medical doctor or clinician, but after reading what qualified people have to say, this makes sense to me. We all use our phones as a crutch from time to time and can feel like we depend on them. For some, this feeling of dependency simply doesn't go away. It's crucial to remember that addiction is complex and often multifactorial. While some individuals might seem more prone, responsible and <strong>mindful</strong> use should be a goal for all of us.</p><h2 id="getting-help-before-it-s-too-late-2">Getting help before it's too late</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.70%;"><img id="LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN" name="digital-wellbeing-downtime.jpg" alt="Digital Wellbeing Downtime" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LPDThG2WfShtgEJWxooirN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Phone makers have realized they can help combat any addiction issues by giving us tools to thwart them. I'm familiar with how Android does it, so that's what I'm diving into here, but Apple and Microsoft (tablets and laptops have an addictive screen, too) also have similar tools and utilities in place. These can empower us all to manage our smartphone habits and maybe stop a problem before it is created.</p><p>The central hub for managing your digital habits is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-digital-wellbeing">Digital Wellbeing Dashboard</a>. It provides things like daily usage reports so you can track how much time you really spent staring into the screen, how long you spend on a particular app, or even how many notifications you get. Try it, it's bound to be an eye-opener.</p><p>On the utility side, you can also set app timers to place a daily limit on how long you can do things like scroll Instagram, and once the time is up, the app is done until tomorrow. Focus Mode can even pause the apps that distract you the most, and they stay muted and out of the way until you turn it off.</p><p>The way your screen looks is important, too.

I believe this is a smart approach during a time when consumers are still a bit overwhelmed by everything.</p><p>And with agentic AI working in the background for you, I think we're finally reaching AI's ultimate form. Sag agrees to an extent, noting that ambient AI has a bigger impact on people's daily lives than on-demand AI.</p><p>"I think it's one of the final forms, especially for consumers.

The company showcased the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14"> OnePlus 15</a> on stage at Qualcomm's Summit in Hawaii this week, and went straight to the 15, likely due to cultural reasons. The company also confirmed that the OnePlus 15 will be one of the first phones to feature Qualcomm's latest and powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 Mobile chipset</a>.</p><p>“With Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 at its core, OnePlus 15 carries that legacy forward—delivering the speed, intelligence, and efficiency our users demand today and into the future,” said Pete Lau, founder of OnePlus.</p><p>Furthermore, OnePlus also confirmed the massive redesign of its new device, giving us a clear look at its rear panel, which seems to have moved away from its traditional circular camera array on the rear panel for a vertical pill-shaped setup showcasing three lenses, also in line with previous leaks.</p><p>That said, the OnePlus 15 could indeed launch in the U.S., but there's no official date yet. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> debuted in the U.S. on January 7, 2025, and we expect OnePlus to follow the same timeline this year as well, despite chatter about an early launch.</p><h2 id="qualcomm-unleashed-the-powerful-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-2">Qualcomm unleashed the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zv6rPCPvpWFWZsjoiuLdnH" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gen-5-Rocks" alt="The Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zv6rPCPvpWFWZsjoiuLdnH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3600" height="2025" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-launch"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>It has been quite an eventful week for Qualcomm, as it launched its next Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, built using Oryon cores. The chip is solely designed for flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, keeping agentic AI and other powerful capabilities in mind.</p><p>The new 3nm chip delivers a significant 20% boost to CPU performance, featuring two prime cores clocked at 4.6GHz and six performance cores optimized for lower-power tasks. This is further enhanced by a faster Adreno GPU, which Qualcomm claims can deliver a 23% performance boost while consuming 20% less power, allowing you to get more out of your gaming experience while worrying less about your battery.</p><p>To put things into perspective, OEMs these days want to pack their devices with as much AI as possible, making sure it doesn't eat up the device's power with all the "thinking" it is doing. A powerful chipset like this one will help take the load off the phone.</p><p>This chip also comes with a 37% faster NPU (Neural Processing Unit); Qualcomm hopes to enable more on-device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">agentic AI</a> features. This means your phone should be able to predict your behaviour and make recommendations based on context.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-galaxy-buds-4-and-4-pro-leak-2">Samsung's Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro leak</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="gF279uLECQwLLapaD8dzL9" name="Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro.jpg" alt="Three pairs of Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro in various colors sitting with case lids open on top of a wooden table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gF279uLECQwLLapaD8dzL9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>One UI's next update has been been at the centre of many leaks for a bit now and the most recent one gave us more than just a sneak at what One UI 8.5 could bring.</p><p>The leak suggests that the Korean OEM has started naming its next buds, the Galaxy Buds 4 and Galaxy Buds Pro 4, with what seems like internal code names. Seen in the test server build supposedly holds clues in its code about the alleged earbuds, with hints to a base and Pro model numbers SM-R540 and SM-R640, respectively.</p><p>Since they were found in the strings in Samsung's test server code, there's not much enough information about them, so nothing on specs or features as yet. But we do know that they exist and are in the works. In another leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Alfaturk16/status/1969164703273287826" target="_blank">tipster Alfaturk on X</a>, claims the company has also started developing the firmware for these alleged Buds 4 and 4 Pro models.</p><h2 id="pixel-watch-users-finally-get-their-m3-expressive-update-2">Pixel Watch users finally get their M3 Expressive update</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cm5EvzUszSHuCp9JzVa4k6" name="Pixel-Watch-4-charging" alt="Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cm5EvzUszSHuCp9JzVa4k6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-app-gives-android-users-long-awaited-m3-expressive-makeover"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Pixel Watch users may finally be seeing their Pixel Watch app show up in a completely new look. According to recent reports, Google seems to be rolling out the Material 3 Expressive changes to the app. The UI sports larger design changes, such as the vertical, pill-shaped row of key Pixel Watch features. The update places Fitbit, Personal Safety, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> right above your device's illustration.</p><p>Beneath that illustration, users will find their connectivity info, battery percentage, and the last time the watch was synced with Fitbit's services. As part of the "main" feature set, users will find Watch Faces and Tiles before scrolling down into their Settings. These new containers and subtle line separators are present throughout the entire app, as well, especially when scrolling through your tiles and other sub-menus.</p><p>The update will bring more pronounced Pixel Watch illustration that's a blue, purple mix, as Google moves away from its classic four-color getup.</p><h2 id="google-search-gets-gemini-ed-2">Google Search gets 'Gemini-ed'</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oa-TzWXE8k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google is bringing Project Astra's capabilities to Google Search, to get real-time answers via Live Search within AI Mode. Think of it as an upgrade to the current Google Lens, and Google's way of pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a>'s multimodal capabilities onto more platforms.</p><p>With "Live Search," users can have real-time, interactive conversations with Google Search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/" target="_blank">AI Mode</a>, much like speaking to the AI chatbot on Gemini Live. This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well. Accessing this feature seems to be a lot more easier as opposed to navigating a ton of steps to help Gemini Live see what you see.</p><p>For instance, you're new to making a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=92X1690538&xcust=ac_ca_5822647110017996600&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fapps.apple.com%2Fus%2Fapp%2Fgoogle%2Fid284815942&sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fapps-software%2Fandroid-os%2Fgoogle-search-goes-live-with-this-new-feature-that-we-didnt-know-we-needed" target="_blank" rel="sponsored">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for. Or you could even ask it questions for a deeper understanding of matcha's history or its rise to fame as a beverage. The Live Search option is available to all Android and iOS users in the U.S. starting Sept. 24.</p><h2 id="more-stories-this-week-2">More stories this week</h2><p>Those are some of the biggest stories from this week.

Needless to say, I'd guess that almost all of these 2025 phones will get discounts this year, plus we're likely to see some great deals on smartwatches, tablets, and more. The Galaxy Watch 8, for instance, is sure to receive its first major discount of the year, and I would be surprised if the Galaxy S25 Ultra dropped to under $1,000.</p><p>On the other hand, Prime Day sales don't usually discount last-gen Samsung devices, and you can expect cheap Samsung phones (such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-a-series-buyers-guide">the popular Galaxy A series</a>) to only receive miniscule price drops.</p><h2 id="do-i-need-to-be-a-prime-member-to-shop-during-big-deal-days-7">Do I need to be a Prime member to shop during Big Deal Days?</h2><p>As with all Prime Day sale events, the vast majority of deals on display during Big Deal Days will be exclusive to Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, you could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime"><strong>sign up for the 30-day free trial</strong></a> to enjoy all of the benefits of Prime, or you could simply wait and see what deals Amazon's competitors have to offer.

The patch notes are reportedly quite light for the Galaxy S25 FE, with the post noting that users will find the September 2025 security patch, alongside "general" stability and performance fixes. It seems as though Samsung is keeping things light, as it has more pressing matters to focus on.</p><p>However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/security-patch-for-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-now-bar-and-dex">September security update</a> was quite important for Samsung's phones, as we reported during its rollout for the 2025 foldables.</p><p>The company's official changelog highlighted an abundance of "High-level" security fixes rolling in with this patch. More importantly, Samsung, alongside Google's Android Bulletin, drew attention to two critical vulnerabilities. The security patch offers a fix for an Android vulnerability, marked as CVE-2025-48539.</p><p>The update was discovered hitting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-galaxy-s25-fe">Galaxy S25 FE</a> devices in Europe today (Sep 26), per the publication.

Roughly ten days ago, Samsung announced the official rollout of One UI 8 (Android 16) for Galaxy S25 series users. With a wide selection of AI features ranging from writing assistance to summaries, Galaxy S25 users were also receiving a revamped software experience.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> took a step forward, offering even more personalization for your daily updates, reminders, and more. Even the series' lock screen got a sweet makeover with more designs and unique wallpapers that might fit who you are.

The patch was spotted in South Korea first, and there's speculation that it should make its way to more regions "in the coming days." While there's so much going on with One UI 8, there was a rumor that claimed Samsung was already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-is-already-chasing-one-ui-8-5-new-leak-spots-galaxy-s25-test">chasing a huge One UI 8.5 update</a>, as its test build reportedly appears on its internal servers.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Fire TV devices have long relied on Amazon’s custom version of Android, evidence is mounting that the company wants more control over its ecosystem, and that means cutting Google’s software out of the picture.</p><p>The clearest sign of this shift came from an earlier job listing, which directly referenced a “Vega OS product” for Fire TV with a 2025 timeline. That mention was quickly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://archive.is/xc0pN" target="_blank">edited out</a>, but not before it raised eyebrows.</p><p>This isn’t the first we’ve heard of Vega OS either. Rumors about the project <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-ditching-android-in-all-of-its-new-devices">date back to 2023</a>, and several Amazon devices like the Echo Hub, Echo Spot, and Echo Show 5 already use lighter versions of it.</p><h2 id="the-reveal-might-be-just-days-away-2">The reveal might be just days away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="XgSMzZBnPiLf8akaPYczD4" name="amazon-fire-tv-home-screen.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire TV Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgSMzZBnPiLf8akaPYczD4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What’s new now is timing. The Verge reports that Amazon could reveal Vega OS as early as September 30, during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-tablet/new-devices-and-ai-upgrades-on-the-horizon-at-amazons-annual-fall-event">big fall hardware event in New York</a>.</p><p>If Vega OS does debut this year, it’s likely to show up first on a more affordable Fire TV Stick rather than a high-end television. Importantly, existing Fire TV hardware won’t suddenly lose support — those devices should keep running Fire OS with Android under the hood for the foreseeable future. But for new models, the software story is about to change.</p><p>A key difference with Vega OS is how it handles apps. Fire OS can run Android apps, but Vega will need developers to create apps just for it, using tools like React Native or HTML5. As a result, sideloading APKs might not work the same way or could go away completely.</p><p>Big streaming apps like Netflix and Apple TV are already building for Vega, but it’ll take a while before the lineup feels as complete as today’s Fire TV. Developers now have to split their time between Fire OS and Vega, and some won’t treat the new system as a priority right away.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I'm just as excited as the next nerd about those, but something was said by Google SVP for Platforms and Devices Rick Osterloh during the CEO Keynote that caught my attention.</p><p>Towards the end of the Keynote, Osterloh was asked by Qualcomm President and CEO Cristiano Amon "What can you share about this new project we're doing together about personal computing?" Right off the bat, that's enough to get my ears to perk up, as I assumed it would have something to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> and ChromeOS. However, Osterloh's response didn't mention ChromeOS or Chromebooks once.</p><h2 id="google-s-entering-the-pc-domain-2">Google's entering the "PC domain"?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fr2-P5rgkOQ?start=3148" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>"In the past we've always had very different systems between what we're building on PCs and what we're building on smartphones. And we've embarked on a project to combine that. And so, we're building together a common technical foundation for our products on PCs and desktop computing systems."</p><p>That might seem like a bunch of fodder, but it's just the build up before Osterloh reaches the crescendo a moment later. "...bringing all of our application and developer community into the PC domain. So we're really excited about this, and I think this is another way in which Android is going to be able to serve everyone in every computing category."</p><h2 id="pixel-laptop-anyone-2">Pixel Laptop anyone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB" name="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" alt="Desktop Mode App Drawer on Android 16 QPR1 Beta 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i9s7WdBF5aUym7mW2ggMHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but that sure sounded like Google is working on something major, with Osterloh trying to remain as tight-lipped about it as possible. Then, Amon let another cat out of the bag, as he replies with "It's incredible. It delivers on the conversion from mobile to PC. I can't wait to have one." So not only is this a separate platform from say, Windows, but it sure sounded like Google's working on some new hardware.</p><p>Immediately, I was reminded of the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/alleged-google-pixel-laptop-early-report">Pixel Laptop</a>" rumor that was making its rounds in late 2024, which was initially said to be running ChromeOS.

Oh right, on the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C, two devices made by Google.</p><p>All of this comes on the back of Google's continued push to merge the ChromeOS and Android kernels, representing a tectonic shift for both platforms. Not to mention all of the progress we've seen with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-desktop-mode-was-right-in-front-of-us-the-entire-time">Desktop Mode on Android 16</a>, letting you plug your phone into a monitor and being presented with an interface similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a> has offered for years.</p><p>Based on the conversation between Osterloh and Amon, I don't think they were talking about a device that requires a phone for it to run (i.e. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/nexdock-wireless-review">NexDock</a>). It just feels like Google is gearing up for a massive release and something that could change the way we think about Android and ChromeOS forever.</p><h2 id="sorry-tensor-the-snapdragon-is-here-2">Sorry Tensor, the Snapdragon is here</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="bCL9oatgKwaZwPUjHcvPLZ" name="qualcomm-snapdragon-x2-elite-plaque-wc" alt="Picture of a plaque for the Snapdragon X2 Elite announcement" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bCL9oatgKwaZwPUjHcvPLZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1165" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's another interesting tidbit to throw into the mix here, and it's not something that I was expecting.

And seeing as the hardware is at the point that its being demoed, albeit privately, this suggests Google is closer than we thought to actually releasing a new piece of hardware to pair with its new OS venture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="4KQk4srKzbT6jtGPCsCcxn" name="lenovo-chromebook-plus-14-hands-on-21" alt="Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4KQk4srKzbT6jtGPCsCcxn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If I were to guess, this would be powered by one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/qualcomm/snapdragon-x2-elite-extreme-announcement-2025">Snapdragon X2 Elite processors</a>, as opposed to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>.

With the launch of their latest lineup, including the updated Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), the new Oakley Meta Vanguard, and the groundbreaking Meta Ray-Ban Display, Meta isn't just releasing new hardware—they're cementing their lead in a market that's just starting to heat up.</p><h2 id="meta-s-hardware-advantage-and-genius-strategy-2">Meta's hardware advantage and genius strategy</h2><p>For anyone betting on the "wait and see" approach from Android XR or others, it's time to get real. The future of AR is here, and it's wearing Ray-Bans. But the implications aren't just for Meta's competitors; there are potential long-term risks for consumers too.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-launch">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard </a>are natural extensions of Meta's long-standing partnership with the eyewear giant EssilorLuxottica. While they may not have a display, they're critical to Meta's strategy. These aren't just minor upgrades; the inclusion of an improved camera is a welcome one, as photo and video capture remains the primary use case for these glasses.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="b6MLc94WARGxTnu3rcf4t8" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-display-Meta-Store-2" alt="A display of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses in various styles." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6MLc94WARGxTnu3rcf4t8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But the real genius here isn't just the hardware. It's the strategy. The partnership with a luxury eyeglass maker provides these smart glasses with an extensive distribution network, including physical stores and e-commerce sites, that the competition simply does not have. Plus, with the addition of Oakley, Meta is tapping into the athletic and performance-driven crowd, broadening the appeal of its hardware beyond the tech-savvy crowd.</p><p>It doesn't just end with distribution or new designs. Meta's glasses have a huge installed base with over 3.5 million units of their previous Ray-Ban Meta glasses already shipped as of the second half of 2025, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/"><u>IDC</u></a> estimates.</p><p>Think about that for a second. While Google and its partners are still in the R&D phase, figuring out how to get a display into their glasses, Meta has millions of users already capturing photos and videos, sharing their lives, and getting comfortable with the idea of tech-enabled eyewear. This isn't a small detail—it puts Android XR firmly on the back foot. They're not just competing on features; they're competing on adoption.</p><h2 id="the-price-war-and-competitive-threat-2">The price war and competitive threat</h2><p>And now, for the main event: the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-hands-on-demo-impressions">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a>. These are the first smart glasses from Meta to include a display, and on a technical level, they offer a unique AR experience that has been out of reach for consumers until now. The $799 price point is a bold choice. It strongly suggests that Meta is willing to heavily subsidize its hardware or at least offer it at a minimal markup.</p><p>The price is high enough to limit appeal to early adopters, but it sets unrealistic expectations for consumers who expect future iterations and competing versions to be offered at a similar or lower price. While this is great news for consumers in the short term, it's a huge problem for the competition. Meta's willingness to subsidize its hardware—something they've done with their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">Quest headsets</a> to great success—puts Google and its partners at a severe disadvantage.</p><p>Historically, Google hasn't been willing to play this game of hardware subsidies to the same extent, which means its partners will have a hard time competing on price. This strategy crowds out competing vendors and allows Meta to solidify its market position without worrying about rivals. For consumers, this is a double-edged sword. While it means access to advanced tech at a lower price now, a lack of competition in the long run could stifle innovation and lead to higher prices, along with a more restricted ecosystem down the road.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SBdxzHfsew8Zg2eEXCd4tX" name="Meta-Connect-Meta-RayBan-Display-IDCxAC" alt="Meta's smart glasses are great and everyone should be worried" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:94,l:240,cw:1440,ch:810,q:80/SBdxzHfsew8Zg2eEXCd4tX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jitesh Ubrani/ IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="android-xr-s-technical-and-timeline-disadvantage-2">Android XR's technical and timeline disadvantage</h2><p>Adding insult to injury, based on what I've heard from some folks in the industry, similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR glasses</a> with displays likely won't hit shelves until late 2026, and even that may be an ambitious timeline, so it likely won't happen until 2027. By the time they finally hit the market, Meta will have had close to a two-year head start.</p><p>Furthermore, the Android XR demos we've seen so far lag Meta in some critical areas. One issue is the lack of a discrete input method. While Meta's neural band introduces a novel and subtle interface, allowing users to navigate on-screen menus through subtle, intentional gestures, Android XR seems to be a step behind.</p><p>Another technical detail that highlights Meta's advantage is their choice of display technology. While<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage"> Android XR demos</a> have been seen using refractive waveguides, which often increase "eye glow" on the wearer's face—potentially creating social friction—Meta's use of geometric waveguides is a game-changer.</p><p>This technical choice results in a much more natural appearance and puts significant pressure on Android XR to find a solution that doesn't make users feel like they're walking around with a glowing screen on their face.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn" name="android-xr-xreal-glasses-reflection" alt="The Android XR logo reflected in the left lens of a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7Yb2YxiTmNyMZWUkHorksn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="meta-s-tricky-limited-rollout-and-consumer-risk-2">Meta's tricky limited rollout and consumer risk</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NCq6GMV3knFYSJtWe3BUwi" name="meta-connect-2025-show-meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-typing-writing" alt="A screen capture of Mark Zuckerberg showing off typing on Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses at Meta Connect 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NCq6GMV3knFYSJtWe3BUwi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Initially launching the Display glasses exclusively in the U.S. and with a limited, curated rollout in select physical retail locations, Meta is taking a cautious, hands-on approach. These stores will offer a tailored experience to ensure proper fit, screen alignment, and onboarding for new users. This isn't just about selling a product; it's about educating the market.</p><p>By focusing on familiar experiences such as messaging and social media—thanks to the deep integration with services like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Meta AI—the company is easing consumers into this new computing paradigm.</p><p>Viewing the product from this lens, the Meta Ray-Ban Display isn't just a consumer product; it's a public prototype. It's designed to gather feedback and evolve, serving as a precursor to Meta's more advanced Orion glasses that were displayed at the company's 2024 developer conference, which offered a full AR experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwgL9vEuHhnL2VFNGWaKA3" name="meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-official-lifestyle-with-gesture-band-07" alt="An official lifestyle shot of someone wearing Meta Ray-Ban Display Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwgL9vEuHhnL2VFNGWaKA3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By the time Android XR finally enters the market in a meaningful way, Meta will have had years of real-world data, millions of users, and a deeply entrenched ecosystem. The Meta Ray-Ban Display allows the company to widen and deepen its moat in the smart glasses market, and with every new release, that moat gets harder for the competition to cross.</p><p>The message is clear: the future of smart glasses is here, and Meta is ready to own it. The question is, can Android XR catch up? More importantly, what happens to consumers when one company has a near monopoly on technology that is so personal and integrated into our daily lives?</p> ]]></dc:content>

These animations typically explain the various functions and features users can expect from their phone or, in this case, TriFold phone. The tipster's first selection regards the device's alleged prowess for multitasking. One look gives us a glimpse at its toggleable "continue apps on main screen" button in Settings.</p><p>After doing so, users can open an app when the device is folded (on its cover display) and open their phone and see the app continue in landscape, rather than portrait.</p><p>On the other hand, we have some leaked animations showcasing the device's splitscreen/dual-app capabilities. The post suggests the TriFold will let users place two apps atop one another on half the screen. Users can drag and drop the apps from the top of their respective windows to reposition them. Other quick actions display a tab at the top of the Galaxy TriFold in landscape mode, which, when tapped, opens your app drawer.</p><p>This functionality is also spotted by a two-finger press-and-hold gesture from the left side of the internal display.</p><p>Another video purports that users can have their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600746690015483">apps as floating windows</a> on the Galaxy TriFold. It really makes the device feel like you're holding a mini-laptop or maybe even a tablet in your hands. Users can expand these floating windows or go full-screen with them, and shift them around as they please.</p><h2 id="something-unexpected-a-strong-camera-2">Something unexpected: a strong camera?</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello again multifold 👋We've got a bunch videos for you... 1/5🧵With the help of @evowizz pic.twitter.com/GUhI8HPx5g<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1971600608051568883">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Samsung DeX was briefly mentioned in this extensive leak by the tipster, who showed off an animation of its PC connection. In the example, the larger display (the PC) embodies the look of the Galaxy TriFold with its background and navigational bar with apps. It shows a cursor, indicating that users can slide onto their TriFold, grab and drag an app over to their computer. It's essentially what you'd expect from Samsung DeX.</p><p>In landscape mode, the phone's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600716411371840">camera app was highlighted</a>. While this isn't entirely new, given we have the Galaxy Z Fold 7, the tipster notes one key addition: the existence of a 100x zoom button. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TechHighest/status/1971600608051568883">other lingering animations</a> brought awareness to Samsung's Galaxy AI, which is coming in clutch (per usual) for users looking for webpage summaries and more. However, the two tipsters found that users could detach this Galaxy AI sidebar that appears and have it as a floating window.</p><p>Moreover, users taking a call (or placing one) will see a floating phone UI for the call. The UI mirrors what you'd find if you were calling on your cover display or even a regular phone, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-unusual-move-2">Samsung's unusual move</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Rumors earlier this month claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">could break tradition</a> and launch its expected Galaxy Z TriFold this fall.

Assuming it's not just a generic image, it suggests COROS will use a different button layout from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-review">APEX 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-apex-2-pro-review">APEX 2 Pro</a>, with a top-right crown and a bottom-left button instead of three right buttons with a centered crown.</p><p>The recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-nomad-3-has-impressed-me-as-fun-garmin-instinct-3-rival">COROS NOMAD</a> has a similar button layout, with the bottom-left Action button used for shortcuts like Voice Pins or Maps; we'd guess the hypothetical APEX 3 will have its own custom shortcuts.</p><p>The teaser image also shows COROS's familiar three-prong charging port and a silicone strap, even though the APEX 2 series defaulted to a nylon strap.</p><p>COROS won't share any more information until October 15 at 9 a.m. EDT.

We'd also expect a price in the $350–500 range.</p><p>One of the big questions will be whether COROS follows industry trends and switches the APEX series to AMOLED. If it keeps MIP, the new APEX would match the NOMAD's display with better visibility and contrast. But rival mid-range watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-forerunner-570-review">Garmin Forerunner 570</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/suunto-race-2-hands-on-accuracy-test">Suunto Race 2</a> use bright AMOLED displays with better resolution, while still offering good longevity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="TwCYCvaMfcmYtgcJdt2zEQ" name="COROS-NOMAD-workout-elevation-summary" alt="The COROS NOMAD watch showing a post-hike workout summary with elevation data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TwCYCvaMfcmYtgcJdt2zEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another question is whether COROS will find a way to close the gap on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> when it comes to mainstream smarts like a mic & speaker for Bluetooth calling, contactless payments, music streaming apps, or a flashlight. But these all feel like longshots.</p><p>The biggest question, in my mind, will be how COROS differentiates the APEX series from the NOMAD and VERTIX series.</p><p>The NOMAD caters to hikers and fishermen, letting you save voice recordings or photos of trails or fish to an Adventure Journal" of each activity for you to look at or share later. And the VERTIX very specifically targets serious climbers. So, what "mountain sports" will the APEX 3 or APEX 3 Pro focus on?</p><p>Whatever COROS has in store with its all-new APEX watch, we're intrigued. While they're a bit outdated at this point, the APEX 2s were among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">best running watches</a> of their time, and they have a more premium look for those who don't like the plastic-heavy PACE and NOMAD designs.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Researchers at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/cve-2025-10184-oneplus-oxygenos-telephony-provider-permission-bypass-not-fixed/" target="_blank">Rapid7</a> found a flaw, identified as CVE-2025-10184, that lets harmful apps read and send your text messages without your permission.</p><p>In practice, this means an attacker could intercept sensitive texts like two-factor authentication (2FA) codes or even send out messages on your behalf, opening the door to account takeovers and fraud.</p><p>Rapid7 explains that the issue started when OnePlus changed Android’s built-in telephony content provider (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/unpatched-flaw-in-oneplus-phones-lets-rogue-apps-text-messages/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>). The company added new components called PushMessageProvider, PushShopProvider, and ServiceNumberProvider, but did not set proper limits on write permissions. Because of this, harmful apps can take advantage of the system using SQL injections or similar tricks, getting around Android’s usual protections.</p><h2 id="which-phones-are-hit-2">Which phones are hit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="98AmdZe62ittUALL9zio8J" name="OnePlus-10T-vs-10-Pro-back-01.jpg" alt="The OnePlus 10 Pro (green) next to the OnePlus 10T (black)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/98AmdZe62ittUALL9zio8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The vulnerability has been confirmed on devices such as the OnePlus 8T with OxygenOS 12 and the OnePlus 10 Pro running OxygenOS 14 and 15, though Rapid7 warns that other models are likely impacted too.</p><p>OxygenOS 11 does not seem to have this problem, which means the flaw likely appeared in later versions. Since the issue affects how SMS messages are handled, it puts <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">most recent OnePlus phones</a> at risk and is more serious than most bugs.</p><p>The situation became more concerning because OnePlus was slow to respond. Rapid7 reported the flaw in May 2025 and followed up several times, but the company did not reply for months. OnePlus only recognized the problem after Rapid7 made its findings public and shared a proof of concept.</p><h2 id="fix-incoming-2">Fix incoming</h2><p>The company has since confirmed that it has developed a fix and promised that a security patch will begin rolling out globally in mid-October, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/09/25/oneplus-devices-have-a-big-sms-vulnerability-but-a-patch-is-finally-on-the-way/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. According to OnePlus, the patch will address the permission bypass and close off the SMS loophole.</p><p>Until the update arrives, OnePlus users should be careful about which apps they install.

It's very affordable in Asia, and you're guaranteed to get a neat, bubble-free application.</p><p>Over the years, I have started to try to apply screen protectors myself because I go through a lot of phones. And I never use any phone without a screen protector, even if it's only a temporary review or test that'll last a month or two. After all, you never know when an accident will happen.</p><p>Spigen is one of the few name brands that offer reasonably priced screen protector kits. Naturally, as soon as I got my Pixel 10 Pro, I got my hands on the full set for my phone. The kit is the most comprehensive one I have seen. It includes a squigee, dusters, a microfiber cloth, an alignment tray, sticky dust removers, and even a placement mat to hold your phone in place.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2643px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-1" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JRDhDQ3BAjRrP7kBAAnN2o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2643" height="1487" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-3" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qdeqnKmDn3gdm3iKUaDp9o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Since there are two screen protectors included in the kit. Each piece of glass comes with its own installation tray. There are also multiple cleaning tools to cover the second application as well.</p><p>The installation process is so simple, even a child could do it. All you have to do is place the Pixel 10 on the mat, clean it up with all the tools provided, and then put the alignment frame on top. It's built to go on top of the phone in a manner that perfectly aligns the screen guard every single time.</p><p>After that, all you have to do is press in the direction that the sticker says so, wait a few seconds, and then pull the tab. That's it! If there are any bubbles, simply use the squeegee to push them out. It's stupidly easy to achieve a beautiful installation with the Spigen GlasTR EZ FIT screen protector kit on your Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3619px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-spigen-screen-protector-lifestyle-4" alt="Installing the Spigen GLAStR EZ Fit screen protector for the Google Pixel 10 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EKTyRUoaNkndagagzSUBvn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3619" height="2036" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I was over the moon to see that the Spigen Optik EZ Fit camera lens protector kit is almost as thorough. The only thing it's missing is the placement mat. But if you get the screen protector as well, like I did, you can simply reuse that mat for the camera lens protector installation.</p><p>There are two sets of everything in the box: a cleaning kit, a squeegee, and two lens protectors with two frames. Just like the screen protector, you tidy up the Pixel 10's camera bar using the provided tools until it's sparkling clean before applying the frame. After that, simply press the lens into place and pull the tab. Voila! Perfection achieved within minutes.</p><p>For just <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-AluminaCore-Aluminum-Enhanced-Durability-Resistance/dp/B0D851Z6N8/"><strong>$19.99 for the Pixel 10 screen protector</strong></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Spigen-Protector-Glas-tR-Designed-Friendly/dp/B0FBDQ73HY/"><strong>$15.99 for the camera bar protector</strong></a>, Spigen delivers phenomenal value. The glass imitates the feel and touch response of the Pixel 10's own display, so you don't even feel like you have a screen guard on.

Kicking off the series is the company's base Xiaomi 17, which mirrors the design consumers got with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>. The newer phone sports a 6.3-inch compact design with rounded corners, flat sides, and a flat display.</p><p>With LIPO technology, Xiaomi states the base 17 can reach 3,500nits of peak brightness.

Additionally, over the last series, the Xiaomi 17 features 100W wired charging, 50W wireless charging, and "compatibility with the 100W PPS universal charging protocol."</p><p>The base model features the following RAM/storage configs: 12/256GB, 12/512GB, and 16/512GB.

Real-time notifications on the Dynamic Back Display include flight alerts, train ticket alerts, delivery info for food orders, and more. More importantly, just like a foldable, this secondary screen can help users take photos, whether it's of other people or themselves.</p><p>Xiaomi draws attention to a special gaming case for the 17 Pro and Pro Max, which turns the models into a retro gaming console when the main display is off.</p><p>The Xiaomi 17 Pro features two 50MP lenses within this back display, with the main camera receiving f/1.67 aperture capabilities.

The Venu 3 looks great indoors and is perfectly readable outdoors, but the Venu 4 matches the brightness standard of most other smartwatches these days.</p><p>Another subtle change is that the Venu 4 display border no longer has clock markings along the edge at five-second intervals. Sportier Garmins tend to add words and numbers in the margins, making the Venu 4 much more subtle and defined by the watch face.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Venu 4 didn't upgrade the Venu 3's Gorilla Glass 3 protection. Garmin reserves sapphire glass for premium models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-x1-review">Venu X1</a>, not acknowledging that "mid-range" models like the Venu 4 and Forerunner 570 cost hundreds more than other watches with higher-end scratch protection.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh" name="Garmin-Venu-3-side-buttons.jpeg" alt="Side view of the Garmin Venu 3's metal buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bAHXaYEvtLaqavhWBYfqdh.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu series skips Garmin's typical five-button layout, relying on two buttons and touch controls. But the Venu 3 added a unique third button for shortcuts — which I found quite convenient — before the Venu 4 (and Venu X1) removed it. I'd guess that not enough people used it, and casuals got it confused with the Back button too often. Plus, it detracted from the Venu series' minimalist look.</p><p>With the Venu 4, the main Start button is smaller and rounder, but still steel-coated, while the Back button keeps the rectangular look.</p><p>Both watches have a stainless steel bezel, but the Venu 4 bezel is smooth where the Venu 3's was ridged. I'd say these design differences are a matter of preference, rather than one being "better" than the other; either bezel is more attractive than the rounded aluminum bezel on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-vivoactive-6-review">Vivoactive 6</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-weighted-ball-workout-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a man's wrist as he works out with an exercise ball." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J47MVuPqQ4scFjcm5g92PS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable design change is that the Venu 4 uses a blend of fiber-reinforced polymer and stainless steel in the case, giving it a more refined look than the Venu 3 but keeping it lighter than the steel <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>.</p><p>Garmin managed to keep the Venu 4 relatively skinny — the 41mm model is still 12mm thick, while the 45mm model is 0.5mm thicker — but both sizes are 9g and 6g heavier than their predecessors, respectively. It's not a massive difference, but where the Venu 3 was lighter than most Garmins, the Venu 4's weight is more typical for the brand.</p><p>Lastly, the Venu 4 colors are pretty much unchanged — Slate, Silver, and a gold option for the smaller model — and Garmin once again gave the Venu 4 silicone bands with smaller (less breathable) holes than on the sporty Forerunner bands. But if you buy it from Garmin, you can customize the Venu 4 with a fabric or leather band instead.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-3-hardware-sensors-battery-life-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3: Hardware, sensors, & battery life</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK" name="Garmin-Forerunner-970-voice-assistant" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 970 on a table outside, the display showing the text "Try Saying 'What can I say?'" for the Voice Assistant." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gbSyFeJY9aXLDo9nRdSUHK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Venu 4's new voice assistant on the Forerunner 970 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin doesn't advertise its processors, but the Venu 4 should run on slightly newer hardware, matching other 2024 and 2025 watches with the newer Garmin OS. This should mitigate the loss of the third shortcut button, because apps and functions are much easier to find with the new UI.</p><p>Both the Venu 4 and Venu 3 have a mic and speaker for Bluetooth calls and passthrough commands to your phone's Gemini or Siri assistant. But the newer OS enables on-watch voice commands like starting a workout or pulling up your sleep score. I find these commands to be finicky and limited, unfortunately.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en" name="Garmin-Venu-3-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG summary page on the Garmin Venu 3 saying the author's sinus rhythm is normal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ySjxwMw9LpmNoqkiNjv3en.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You won't find any changes to the health sensors. The Venu 3 was one of the first models to use Garmin's fifth-generation sensors with ECG readings, skin temperature data, and an HR accuracy boost. Two years later, even ultra-expensive models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a> still use this sensor suite.</p><p>Garmin has patented <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-has-patented-long-term-blood-glucose-tracking-heres-how-itd-work">long-term glycated hemoglobin tracking</a>, hemocrit tracking, and other new metrics that we'd have loved to see the Venu 4 introduce. Instead, the only new Venu 4 health features are software-based, which we'll discuss in the next section.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR" name="Garmin-Venu-4-flashlight-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 at night with the flashlight on and pointing at the camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BwfPiNmLwk7eLns9ey8LnR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like most 2025 Garmins, the Venu 4 adds a built-in LED flashlight with four white brightness settings and one dim red setting, all accessible by long-pressing the Back button. You can set it to blink or strobe during nighttime activities to avoid collisions or hold your arm steady to illuminate a small portion of the road ahead of you.</p><p>What's slightly more surprising is that the Venu 4 now has dual-band GPS tracking! The Venu 3 — and even the $800 Venu X1 — use all-systems GNSS, which delivers dependably accurate data in normal circumstances but isn't quite as <em>pinpoint</em> accurate in tougher conditions. It makes the Venu 4 more appealing to the Forerunner and Fenix crowd.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi" name="Garmin-Venu-3-body-battery.jpeg" alt="A Body Battery chart on the Garmin Venu 3, showing stress levels in the background contributing to higher battery drain." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rdbZRsBBrhq35Cyzuhaoi.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another noticeable trend with recent Garmin watches is that their doubled brightness corresponds to lower battery life. The Venu 4 45mm only lasts 12 days (four with AOD), while the Venu 3 45mm lasts 14 days (five with AOD). It's a slight compromise, but an easier one to accept than the Venu X1 (eight days or two with AOD).</p><p>If you're looking at a smaller model, both the Venu 4 and 3 41mm hit 10 days per charge, but the older model lasts an extra two days in AOD mode. And the Venu 4 41mm's 12 multi-band GPS hours are low for any Garmin watch.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-3-software-and-features-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3: Software and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8186px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LHjEway6iNHMBwYgKeKUrS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-push-ups-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a man's wrist as he does weighted push-ups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LHjEway6iNHMBwYgKeKUrS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8186" height="4605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><div ><table><caption>Garmin Venu 4 vs. 3 key software</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 4</p></th><th  ><p>Garmin Venu 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Health & Wellness</p></td><td  ><p>Body Battery, All-day stress, Sleep Coach, <strong>Sleep alignment</strong>, <strong>Sleep consistency</strong>, <strong>Smart Wake alarm</strong>, Nap Detection, Breathing variations, Health Snapshot, <strong>Health Status</strong>, <strong>Lifestyle logging</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Body Battery, All-day stress, Sleep Coach, Nap Detection, Breathing variations, Health Snapshot</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Accessibility</p></td><td  ><p>Wheelchair mode, <strong>color filters, spoken watch face</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Wheelchair mode</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Workouts</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Personal: Daily suggested workouts for running, cycling, walking, and overall fitness</strong></p><p><strong>Premade: </strong>Cardio, HIIT, <strong>Multisport</strong>, Pilates, Strength, Wheelchair, Yoga</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Personal: </strong>None</p><p><strong>Premade: </strong>Cardio, HIIT, Pilates, Strength, Wheelchair, Yoga</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Coaching</p></td><td  ><p><strong>Garmin Running Coach, Cycling Coach, Strength Coach, Fitness Coach</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Running Coach Experts</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Training</p></td><td  ><p>Intensity minutes, HRV Status, VO2 Max, workout benefit, recovery time, <strong>training status, training load focus / ratio, training effect, training readiness, heat/ altitude acclimation</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Intensity minutes, HRV Status, VO2 Max, workout benefit, recovery time</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Running</p></td><td  ><p>Running dynamics, running power, <strong>performance condition, grade-adjusted pace, lactate threshold, Pacepro, race predictor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Running dynamics, running power</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Courses</p></td><td  ><p>Back to start, <strong>TracBack, downloadable courses, breadcrumb navigation, Up Ahead, distance to destination</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Back to start</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The table above doesn't cover <em>every</em> new Venu 4 software feature, but I've emphasized the highlights.

And it pulls features like the smart wake alarm and daily suggested walks from the Vivoactive 6.</p><p>Aside from these imported tools, the Venu 4 introduces a few exclusive perks — at least until Garmin ports them to other models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8149px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yuqPkgh3idTL5Mi4Soy2dS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-weighted-ropes-photo" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she trains with weighted battle ropes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yuqPkgh3idTL5Mi4Soy2dS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8149" height="4584" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin has traditionally siloed its coaching and suggested workouts into individual categories like running, cycling, and strength. The Venu 4, however, is getting a new generalized "Fitness Coach" that "provides personalized workouts for over 25 different fitness activities – from walking and indoor cycling to rowing, HIIT, and more."</p><p>This feels tailored to the Venu series, which has traditionally focused more on indoor gym or home workouts with animations and muscle maps. And the same goes for the new "mixed session activity" profile, which will let you track different gym workouts in one general activity instead of splitting them up or using one "Cardio" activity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-right inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK" name="garmin-venu-4-health-status-screenshot" alt="A render of the Garmin Venu 4 showing the user's "Last Sleep" data with Heart Rate and HRV stats against their baseline, with a phone next to the watch showing more in-depth Health Status data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwBuxQnrGUCNtYxsMepxRK.png" mos="" align="right" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-right expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class="pull-right inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Health Status shows how your body's nightly heart rate, blood oxygen, HRV, skin temperature, and respiration rate compare against your baseline. It then warns you via the Morning Report if you have any "outliers" as a sign of illness or poor lifestyle choices.</p><p>On that note, Lifestyle logging has you tell Garmin the positive, negative, or neutral actions you've taken throughout the day so that it can provide insights into their physiological impact on metrics like stress and sleep quality. You can log eating or drinking coffee late, having a period or migraine, wearing a CPAP, getting a massage or acupuncture, or <em>many</em> other options.</p><p>The Venu 3 will receive both of these features, but only in the Connect <em>app</em>; if you want a Health Status watch widget or easy on-wrist logging, you'll need the Venu 4.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-accessibility" alt="A photo of a disabled basketball player in a wheelchair, bouncing the ball while wearing the Garmin Venu 4 in the other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c2kQfCzQT8XnTLws6Rf9wS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Venu 3 first introduced a wheelchair mode and tracked pushes instead of steps.

It'll also track your "sleep consistency" after seven days of tracking.</p><h2 id="garmin-venu-4-vs-venu-3-which-should-you-buy-or-should-you-upgrade-2">Garmin Venu 4 vs. Venu 3: Which should you buy, or should you upgrade?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS" name="Garmin-Venu-4-yoga" alt="A photo of the Garmin Venu 4 on a woman's wrist as she does a yoga pose on a mat." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2WXustBPFucpSfKJWfVtKS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Garmin watches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/are-garmin-watches-like-fenix-8-pro-getting-too-expensive">getting more expensive</a>, so the $550 Venu 4 doesn't surprise me. But it's still expensive for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watch</a>; the Venu 3 felt more accessible, in the same range as other "normal" smartwatches. You can argue that dual-band GPS, flashlight, training load, and other perks are worth $100 extra, but it's not clear if Venu fans will care about these perks as much as Fenix or Forerunner users.</p><p>Ultimately, I think your upgrade decision will come down to the new health and training tools, more than the hardware. Do you want a new personalized training plan, or running/ cycling workouts as cross-training for your gym workouts? Or do you want more insights on how to live a healthier lifestyle with better sleep? If this sounds intriguing, the Venu 4 will be a good fit.</p><p>If that all sounds superfluous, I'd say you can stick with the Venu 3 and hold out until 2027 for a Venu 5 with newer health sensors.

These glasses last nearly twice as long on a single charge versus the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>.

The battery life of each pair is also nearly double that is Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1), delivering 60% more photos and video capture per charge, plus longer audio playback and livestreaming.

I took these styles out for testing and found that Oakley Meta HSTN don't stay on as well as the Ray-Bans if you tilt your head a lot. In this case, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/sBL0acIBb2Y?si=IezdCieQBb_xM-sm&t=137">I used burpees as a test</a>, but skateboarding or other intense sports like that could easily see your glasses flying off if you don't have a chance to push them back up.</p><p>That's at least a little ironic since the Oakley's are geared more toward athletes than Ray-Ban Metas. On the flip side, Oakley Meta HSTN PRIZM lenses are a unique take on tinted lenses that work exceptionally well in the sun, blocking out a significant portion of light and adding a vibrant hue to your world. You can only get them on Oakley glasses, so while they're a pricier upgrade, they're worth it for folks who spend a lot of time outside.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-color-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses to see the color difference" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-tint-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses for tinting" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZhCor9KExLYe7L9pYExbm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) also wins on sheer number of style options. Oakley Meta HSTN has just one frame style with four different color options. From there, you can also choose from six different lens colors and types: clear, Transitions grey, Transitions amethyst, PRIZM Ruby, PRIZM deep water polarized, and PRIZM black polarized.</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) are offered in three main styles: Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler. Wayfarers are available in six different colors, Skylers are available in seven different colors, and Headliners are available six different colors. Each style also includes the option of choosing different lens types and colors, from transitions, polarized lenses, prescription lenses, or plain clear lenses.</p><p>That gives the Ray-Bans the clear edge but, as with anything fashion-related, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. As a bonus, the cheapest pair of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses is $20 cheaper than Oakley Meta HSTN, which is great if you just want a snazzy color and standard, clear lenses.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-a-great-pair-of-smart-glasses-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta HSTN glasses: A great pair of smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-glasses-selfie-Black" alt="A selfie of the author wearing Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses with Black lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fab4taxMjQQ2osmqxSfRxD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Regardless if you pick Oakley Meta HSTN or Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), you're getting a great pair of smart glasses that'll last you most of the day and come packed with exciting Meta AI features.</p><p>What's more is that the new video recording features packed inside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-smart-glasses-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vangaurd</a> smart glasses are also coming to both Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) and Oakley Meta HSTN.</p><p>That includes slow-motion video recording, as well as hyperlapse recording.

At one of Qualcomm's designated zones, the publication reports that Samsung's XR headset, currently known as "Project Moohan," was inside a glass case with its branding showcased prominently.</p><p>Summit visitors were able to get a clear look at the device in its entirety, though Samsung was reportedly not sharing any details—Qualcomm neither. The device <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsungs-xr-headset-could-finally-launch-in-september">looks pretty similar</a> to what we've seen shown off from Google's side and Samsung's side this year.</p><p>The large front houses the display technologies (supposedly OLEDoS tech) and everything else Samsung needs for the XR headset to function. Now, The Elec cites Qualcomm, which spoke briefly about its chipset, the Snapdragon 8 Elite (from 2024), stating it supports "smooth photo editing and video speed control with on-device AI." The publication speculates that Samsung's headset could sport some of these capabilities once users get their hands on it.</p><p>It's also been reiterated that Project Moohan will receive a healthy dose of Google's Gemini.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-first-xr-headset-is-inbound-2">Samsung's first XR headset is inbound</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:866px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.28%;"><img id="HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-front" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HPngbyiongeXT7q4x6M3jQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="866" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:945px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.49%;"><img id="TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ" name="samsung-project-moohan-summit-2025-inside-view" alt="A snapshot of Samsung's XR headset, Project Moohan, in a glass display case at Qualcomm's Snapdragon Summit 2025." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TnuGR3r3BvsgACyAF6TaiQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="945" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Elec)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>All we can do now (for a little while longer) is speculate on the device's specs, which, according to some previous rumors, include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-could-use-sony-4k-micro-oled-displays-in-project-moohan-headset">Sony 4K micro-OLED displays. </a>This display could provide the XR headset with 3,552 × 3,840 resolution, 1,000-nit brightness, and 90fps capabilities.

You get a massive screen, for example, and decent cameras with a durable build, but a slightly less powerful processor. The result is a premium phone alternative without the huge price tag of the regular series models.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE is the latest addition to the FE line.

It comes in Navy, Jetblack, Icyblue, or White with a bicolor frame and Premium Haze finish. During a brief hands-on with the phone, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">our reviewer</a> found that it feels a lot like the Galaxy S24 FE. But he appreciates the smooth matte finish on the back instead of the glossy back of the Galaxy S24 FE, which eliminates the pesky fingerprint problem with the older model. He also loves the contrasting look of the darker colors with the silver aluminum side rails.</p><p>Equipped with a 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ display that sports 2,340 x 1,080 resolution with 120Hz refresh rate and Vision Booster, the Galaxy S25 FE is in line with other Samsung models that cost much more; you might not even be able to tell the difference. Peak brightness is a decent 1,900 nits as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4578px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS" name="Samsung-S25-FE-official-images" alt="Samsung launches its budget new S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Z7LDSAyX8gRv3fH3zyZXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4578" height="2575" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Boasting an Armor Aluminum frame, the screen is covered with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ and the phone sports an IP68 rating, so you can be confident it’s protected against dust and water. Most notably, it’s the slimmest and lightest FE phone from Samsung ever, measuring just 7.4mm thin and weighing 190 grams. Compare that to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, which is 8mm thin and weighs 213 grams, and it’s a noticeable enough difference. “Anytime you can get a 6.7-inch smartphone under 200 grams,” our reviewer notes, “it’s worth taking note of – this is a difference you’ll feel in both your hand and pocket.”</p><p>It comes with either 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB storage, which is fairly standard. But you get a six-month trial subscription to Google AI Pro with the phone, which includes 2TB cloud storage. Just keep in mind that you’ll have to pay up after the half-year ends if you want to continue using it.</p><p>The battery is bigger at 4,900mAh, but it still has the same rated life, giving you about 28 hours of continuous video viewing per charge. Basically, you’ll need to charge either phone daily. The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE does, however, charge more quickly, getting you to 65% in just 30 minutes. It supports 45W wired charging — a marked increase from just 25W in the Galaxy S24 FE — and 25W wireless charging, up from 15W in the previous-generation phone. You’ll need a compatible wireless charger to enjoy the speedier charging rate, though.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE home screen in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nFMkDSensEgPivRafCToGQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Launched in September 2024, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE is still a solid phone that comes in at around the same price. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">our hands-on</a>, we found that it doesn’t look much different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S23 FE</a> or even the same-sized <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-plus-review">Galaxy S24 Plus</a>. Perhaps this is a good thing when it comes to the latter, suggesting the phone looks more premium than it is. Available in Blue, Graphite, Gray, and Mint, it has the same 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x FHD+ display with the same resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and 1,900 nits brightness. So, there’s no upgrade in that respect.</p><p>It has an aluminum frame as well, along with Corning Gorilla Glass Victus+ and an IP68 rating. It’s not quite as slim, but in terms of dimensions beyond the thickness, it’s not far off from the Galaxy S25 FE. This is still a sleek phone with a massive screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EGgoKHnGdVYGf78YNQF5hP" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-rear-cameras-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE rear cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EGgoKHnGdVYGf78YNQF5hP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can choose from 128GB or 256GB storage options; there’s no 512GB model. While the battery is a smaller 4,700mAh, you get the same rated battery life. However, as noted, the phone charges more slowly.</p><p>Both phones give you seven software updates and seven years of security support. So, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which launched in September 2025 with Android 16, will be good through 2032 and Android 23. Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, which launched with Android 14, will be supported through 2031 and Android 21. In both cases, the phones are still worth considering “current.”</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-the-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: The specs</h2><p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14, (Samsung One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Samsung One UI 6.1)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Navy, Jetblack, Icyblue, White</p></td><td  ><p>Blue, Graphite, Gray, Mint</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED FHD+</p></td><td  ><p>AMOLED FHD+</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 2400e</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128/256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main wide-angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto, 12MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main wide-angle, 12MP ultra-wide, 8MP telephoto, 10MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,900mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.3 x 76.6 x 7.4 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162 x 77.3 x 8 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>190 grams</p></td><td  ><p>213 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-usability-features-and-functions-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Usability, features, and functions</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-FE-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in hands-on photos." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QqjoMXLeFRd8FHrGZRCMaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While looks and basic specs are important, what you probably really want to know is if there are any marked differences in how these two phones operate and what they can do. The simple answer is, there are some.</p><p>When it comes to the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, it has a superior Exynos 2400 processor. This is still a step down from the regular line, but it offers a compelling enough experience for some users. Combined with the 13% larger vapor chamber, you get a decent gaming experience without worrying that the phone will overheat. And you can multitask to your heart’s content. Both phones have 8GB of RAM.</p><p>Along with Galaxy AI, which affords features like real-time information and insights, along with some cool photo editing features (discussed in the next section), you get fully integrated Gemini Live with the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE. This unlocks plenty of AI features and assistance, including popular ones like Circle to Search, as well as Browsing Assist, Writing Assist, and more. You can access Gemini seamlessly across apps, affording a unique and helpful experience. As noted, you can try advanced features with the six-month trial to Google AI Pro.</p><p>There’s also One UI 8, which adds things like customized wallpapers and widgets, and the new Samsung Now Bar that provides useful information at a glance and Now Brief, a daily summary of your day. Additionally, there’s Quick Share, which makes it simple to share photos, videos, and files with nearby Samsung devices (the Galaxy S24 FE supports this feature as well, and will be updateable to One UI 8).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-google-search.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy S24 FE Google search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2EFx9998iGenAgS3t8tQH5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE includes AI features, too, but it’s a pared-down set out of the box. You get Galaxy AI and access to features like Circle to Search, Live Translate, Interpreter, Photo Assist, and Browsing Assist. While Gemini Live doesn’t come with the phone out of the box, you are able to upgrade to use it.</p><p>It comes with the Exynos 2400e processor, which is nearly identical to the Exynos 2400 in the Galaxy S25 FE. The Exynos 2400e has a lower clock speed, so it isn’t quite as powerful. But it’s designed to optimize the device, and is sufficient for most. Our reviewer says it feels snappy, so you probably won’t even notice the downgrade unless you’re a heavy, intense user of high-bandwidth apps, like games.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-the-difference-with-the-cameras-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: The difference with the cameras</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wQDCSXAu2sTV6m7dfLGy6T" name="Samsung-S25-FE-official-images" alt="Samsung launches its budget new S25 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQDCSXAu2sTV6m7dfLGy6T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="3213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central )</span></figcaption></figure><p>The cameras in these two phones are largely identical, with a 50MP wide-angle main sensor, 12MP ultra-wide, and an 8MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The biggest difference is with the front selfie camera, which is 12MP in the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, 20% higher resolution than the 10MP front camera in the Galaxy S24 FE. This could be a worthwhile upgrade for those who take a lot of selfies, group selfies using the front camera, or who record content for social media and livestream from their phones.</p><p>Speaking of recording content, the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE has some new features that mark an upgrade in this department, including audio erase and auto trim. But these features should be making their way to the Galaxy S24 FE as well. On the AI side, it also adds Writing Assist. It has a low-noise mode for night videos as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="84ECwg3FFRzwd59NUHcGEJ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-dual-recording-2.jpg" alt="Dual Recording on Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/84ECwg3FFRzwd59NUHcGEJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Both phones have an AI ProVisual Engine and support generative editing features with photos. This includes features like Photo Assist that help you get the best photo result possible. Enjoy other fun and useful photo-related features as well, like Portrait Studio, so you can turn your photos into art of different styles.</p><p>Overall, there isn’t a massive difference in the cameras in these two phones. But if you post social content or tend to use the front camera often, the improvements with the Galaxy S25 FE might sway you in its direction.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-vs-samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-which-should-you-buy-2">Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs. Samsung Galaxy S24 FE: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM" name="S25-FE-Bezels" alt="The bezels on the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE that aren't uniform." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5MFLoWPjddb7oCNtfNvymM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It’s decision time. Between the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE vs Galaxy S24 FE, considering they both come in at around the same price, you’d best go with the newer model. If you have the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE already, however, it isn’t worth the upgrade just yet. Hang onto that phone because most of the enhancements with the Galaxy S25 FE are OS based and have either already made their way to the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE via Android 16 or One UI 8, or will in the near future.</p><p>There are moderate improvements, including the ultra-slim and sleek design, the cool new colors, faster charging, and the fact that the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE will last for two additional OS upgrades since the Galaxy S24 FE launched with Android 14. But it’s nothing earth-shattering.</p><p>Bottom line: go with the Samsung Galaxy S25 FE if you’re buying new, but stick with the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE if you already own it — or you can get one for a ridiculously killer deal. You won’t be losing out on much.

For users looking to get creative with Honor's next flagship phone, which will utilize the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip, the post states you'll find the industry's first "Agent-powered Magic Color" system. This system takes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a>, the company's previous commitment to stronger, smarter on-device AI, to a whole new level.</p><p>Honor states Magic Color pairs its on-device AI with "advanced semantic understanding" to create an easy image editing experience for everyday users and creators that embody professional edits. Through "one-sentence commands," Honor says users can transform their images, restyle them, and extract "key color tones" to be used in other places.</p><p>On a more technical side, the improved power of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has helped facilitate Honor's "Dual-Engine" approach to on-device AI.</p><p>The company says it's looking to solve three key issues with on-device AI: computing power, memory, and energy consumption. At the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event, Honor introduced its Low-Bit Quantization tech, a first for Android. Using Qualcomm's Hexagon NPU, this new tech boosts computing power by 15%, lowers energy consumption by 30%, and takes up 30% less storage. This Low-Bit tech is also said to speed up the rate at which its on-device AI can process and surface data.</p><h2 id="performance-the-magic-8-pro-2">Performance & the Magic 8 Pro</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="geQTpYJNLwYUa6KbwJtvNK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-summit-2025-teaser" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro in a light greenish-blue colorway, showing its rounded, centered camera array during the company's appearance at the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/geQTpYJNLwYUa6KbwJtvNK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="JVVv6pJr2oVw2BATYt54PK" name="honor-magic-8-pro-summit-2025-teaser-stand" alt="The Honor Magic 8 Pro in a light greenish-blue colorway, showing its rounded, centered camera array during the company's appearance at the Snapdragon Summit 2025 event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JVVv6pJr2oVw2BATYt54PK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Performance is the other side of this "Dual-Engine" approach Honor's got going on this year. When it comes to gaming, Honor says it has introduced its GPU-NPU Heterogeneous AI Super Sampling tech. What this means is that, through AI reconstruction, Honor's technology can take low frame rates and resolution and raise the bar, sort of like DLSS on a gaming PC. During its testing, Honor says this Super Sampling tech can achieve 120fps at 1080p from something that originally ran at 60fps on-device.</p><p>Fang Fei, president of products at Honor, said, "By working with leading partners such as Qualcomm Technologies to continually redefine what's possible with on-device AI, we move closer to creating an open, co-created, value-sharing world where everyone can benefit from AI."</p><p>These new AI achievements from Honor are said to arrive on its Magic 8 Pro and Magic Pad 3 Pro "next month." However, it's the company's next flagship phone that's garnering a little attention late this week. The Magic 8 Pro was there during Honor's keynote speech at Snapdragon Summit 2025, where it stunned with rounded corners, flat sides, and a seemingly flat display.</p><p>It's a design similar to what consumers received with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Magic 7 Pro</a>. The next iteration will keep its centered, rounded camera housing with a glossy ring encircling it from beneath. The device will launch in China in October. There's no word about a global launch just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Dbrand emailed me to brag today. The company just launched its first in-store options at Best Buy, a notable point in the company's online-only history. Now that they have the opportunity to directly compete with names like Otterbox, Spigen, and CASeTIFY, you'd think things would get a little more difficult for them.</p><p>Apparently not.</p><p>In just 48 hours, they made $1 million in phone case and screen protector sales, even eclipsing Apple's own cases that launched with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/deciding-between-iphone-17-models-as-an-android-user-heres-what-to-consider">iPhone 17</a>. Less surprisingly, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/dbrand-killswitch-travel-kit-for-nintendo-switch-2/J89GJY738K">Killswitch Nintendo Switch 2 case</a> is now sitting at #2 for Switch 2 accessories, only sitting behind Nintendo's Pro controller.</p><p>But I shouldn't be at all surprised, and you probably aren't if you've ever used a Dbrand skin, case, or screen protector before, either. The Killswitch is by far the best Switch 2 case, and it's hard to beat the company's phone cases thanks to their epic build quality. Some of them even offer skinning capability, so you can restyle your phone without having to switch out your favorite case.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cc89d1b1-d7dc-40a9-99ea-aff5e35fef09" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" data-dimension48="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&st=dbrand" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="PU2iCLev4wbydFK5qGxhxC" name="dbrand-ghost-2-case-official-render-google-pixel-10-pro-xl" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PU2iCLev4wbydFK5qGxhxC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Get full protection for your Google Pixel 10 Pro XL or Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra without hiding that beautiful color you spent so long deliberating over.

This one does both, with a rubberized, textured grip you're going to love. Better yet, the buttons remain clicky and separated, because we all know how awful some cases can make your phone's buttons feel.</p><p>The only downside is that the Ghost 2.0 cases aren't designed for Dbrand skins. The skins aren't sold at Best Buy, anyway, so you'll need to buy them from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dbrand.com/">the Dbrand website</a> if you were looking for the skinnable Grip Case.</p><p>Thankfully, at least, this case has a small lip on the front side that leaves plenty of room for a screen protector, and Dbrand has you covered there with another Best Buy-available product.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a28ee328-6d2d-4fa2-8547-6d018f0515cb" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" data-dimension48="For Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?id=pcat17071&st=dbrand" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="jYNYbLpnW2sPFRF8ooPenF" name="dbrand-prism-2-official-render-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYNYbLpnW2sPFRF8ooPenF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Screen protectors are usually a pain to install, but Dbrand has figured out how to make the process completely painless with a one-step applicator.

I put one on my Nintendo Switch 2 and couldn't believe that there was no dust or anything between the massive screen and the tempered glass screen protector.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, applying the Prism 2.0 to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10</a> Pro XL was just as effortless.

Prism 2.0 works with <strong>all</strong> Dbrand cases, so even if you wanted to buy a skinnable Grip case for your phone, you can still pick up a Prism screen protector at Best Buy today and keep the screen protected until your case arrives.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're like me, the memories of arcades are mostly relegated to childhood. If you're young enough, you may never have had the chance to experience the unique atmosphere of a 1980s neon-lit arcade, but one Meta Quest accessory is bringing that feeling right to your living room.</p><p>The slightly-difficult-to-type X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR is an arcade stick like none I've ever used, and it's built specifically to work with everything from a PlayStation 5 to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>. One look at it might make you think it's only for serious Street Fighter 6 tournament enthusiasts, but this black, white, and red beauty is built for so much more.</p><p>It ranks right up there with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-meta-quest-3-accessories">best Meta Quest accessories</a> for me, as it not only provides a unique experience for all types of games, but it's dead easy to setup and regularly play on. It's made me fall in love with pinball games all over again, and it's the perfect accessory <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/why-does-retro-gaming-and-emulation-matter-so-much">for emulation lovers like my co-worker, Andrew Myrick</a>.</p><h2 id="a-home-arcade-2">A home arcade</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4d7JZZEkEPrzZj3oFtytg" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-top" alt="An X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR cabinet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4d7JZZEkEPrzZj3oFtytg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you might gather from the image above, the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR is a hefty arcade stick setup with 2-player functionality and several different input options. My unit came with an adjustable metal stand that's impressively sturdy (and very heavy), complete with wheels on the back so you can move it around without too much trouble.</p><p>The unit plugs into a custom 2-port USB plug (that only takes up one wall outlet port). It comes with both globe and bat-shaped joystick heads, a set of connectors and adapters that help make it compatible with a range of home consoles, and a clever Bluetooth adapter that plugs into a Meta Quest headset's USB-C port.</p><p>This dongle means there's <em>zero</em> configuration required to get the Arcade2TV-XR working with supported games on your VR headset. To put it simply, I did not expect this. I low-key dreaded having to set up a bunch of stuff just to get it working and was beyond surprised when I found out there wasn't any real setup required at all.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jjvfUC72ejpkjTTv5AKvJi" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-controllers" alt="Docking a Meta Quest 3 controller into the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jjvfUC72ejpkjTTv5AKvJi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.35%;"><img id="CrBQvKbnTj6TePr8e3YeVi" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-01" alt="The X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrBQvKbnTj6TePr8e3YeVi.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="2731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3UjZsto6CLQH4mgar2V2Ji" name="x-arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-buttons" alt="An up-close look at the buttons on the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3UjZsto6CLQH4mgar2V2Ji.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Let's start with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/pinball-fx-vr/7255396864545733/">Pinball FX VR</a> since that was the main draw for me here, anyway. You fire up the game and find yourself in the middle of a giant pinball arcade you can virtually walk around in. The moment you fire up the game, it recognizes that you've got an X-Arcade unit. We're already off to a good start!</p><p>As I walked up to a pinball table, I got another message telling me to dock the controllers into the physical X-Arcade unit and press the side buttons simultaneously. The moment I did this, the game pulled the pinball table right up to my hip and placed my virtual hands on the flipper buttons.</p><p>As you might assume, these buttons were in the exact same spots as the physical X-Arcade unit standing in front me. I was immediately impressed because <em>it just worked</em>. If I had a dime for every time I said that about a game that needs some kind of connected accessory to work, I'd be quite poor.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUNnsiaMMndRuJVVxLE277" name="pinball-fx-x-arcade-01" alt="Using the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR unit in Pinball FX VR on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUNnsiaMMndRuJVVxLE277.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cKLeUzbaLiL8C9ESkNfk67" name="pinball-fx-x-arcade-02" alt="Using the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR unit in Pinball FX VR on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cKLeUzbaLiL8C9ESkNfk67.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The next few hours saw me racking up high scores while enjoying the physical tactile feel of an arcade cabinet, all without the grunge on the buttons from years of misuse. It's so incredibly well-built it feels like it'll withstand just about anything I'd throw at it (even literally), and the buttons and joysticks are all made of the same high-quality materials you'd expect of a proper arcade cabinet.</p><p>The height adjusts so that it's comfortable for both standing and seated players, which further widens the appeal. I also <em>love</em> that it has docking stations for the left and right Meta Quest controllers, as it makes it dead easy to switch between inputs and perfectly align virtual cabinets with the physical X-Arcade unit.</p><p>I'd recommend picking up an official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Open-Facial-Interface-Visibility/dp/B09MJQW8HC/">Meta Quest 3 open facial interface</a> if you find you really love mixed reality gaming with this. Pinball enthusiasts can even order <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.xgaming.com/blogs/news/x-force-haptics-kit-august-2025-development-update">a haptic adapter set</a> that adds spring-loaded plungers, vibration motors, and more.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OGfhfHTlG4c" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>X-Arcade also makes its own app for the Meta Quest called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/arcade-ranger/5682698088461039/">Arcade Ranger</a>. A free copy of the game comes with every Arcade2TV-XR arcade stick and is designed to be your personal virtual arcade. In this app, you have an entire arcade that you can customize. You can even jump into sandbox mode and turn a completely empty room into the arcade of your dreams, or just stick to mixed reality mode and use your own physical room.</p><p>The app makes it easy to download emulator cores, but you'll need to supply your own ROMs (as expected). Just drop ROMs into a folder, tell it where to look, and it'll load things up. It works like any other emulator experience you've ever delved into.</p><p>Emulation isn't exactly my forte as it requires more configuration than I have patience for, but I was happy to see that you could also connect the arcade stick to a PC and use it as a regular X Input device, meaning it's perfect for playing anything on Steam VR if you've already got a great emulation setup on your PC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="CsfsREEa7tSFNnqaDNEpBf" name="arcade-ranger-donkey-kong-country" alt="Playing Donkey Kong Country on a small CRT TV in Arcade Ranger on a Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CsfsREEa7tSFNnqaDNEpBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1650" height="928" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: X-Arcade)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The obvious advantage over a physical arcade cabinet (or multiple cabinets) is that this saves a ton of space and also gives you a way to play many other types of games that wouldn't normally be supported on an arcade cabinet setup. That includes big ol' pinball tables. Heck, you can even recreate your childhood and play Donkey Kong Country on a 20-inch CRT TV within the Arcade ranger app, if that's your jam.</p><p>It's an expensive setup, no doubt, but competing emulation arcade cabinets with a physical display will cost something like 4x the price of this unit, making it a surprisingly good deal. Plus, with the ability to use it on any console or PC with a simple adapter, it's an investment that'll last a long time for any gamer that loves a good arcade stick.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="157bf72f-67c2-40a0-9ab6-53b0d5f3a472">            <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/X-Arcade-Arcade2TV-XR-Tankstick-VR-Controller-2-Player-Fightstick-Trackball-RGB-Lighting-Meta-Quest-3-Integration-Pinball-FX-Arcade-Ranger/16866671271" data-model-name="X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BLc6qgKVxmibT8DE7WeYTC.jpg' alt="An official render of the X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR "cabinet""></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">X-Arcade Arcade2TV-XR</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Get the real feeling of an arcade cabinet in your home with the flexibility of a virtual reality arcade, all with official support for your Meta Quest headset.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Unlike traditional tools, it doesn’t stop at static generation, meaning you can edit your board using natural language commands like “make this brighter” or “combine these two elements,” and quickly spin off variants with the “regenerate” or “more like this” options.</p><h2 id="gemini-nano-banana-the-tech-behind-the-tool-2">Gemini + Nano Banana: The tech behind the tool</h2><p>At the heart of Mixboard is Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini AI</a> model, paired with a new image editing engine called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">Nano Banana</a>. This tool focuses on making subtle but powerful adjustments through text prompts rather than manual tweaking. You can also upload your own images and let the AI adapt or extend them, making Mixboard useful not only for inspiration but also for remixing existing ideas.</p><p>Google emphasizes that Mixboard is not a polished design suite like Photoshop or Canva. Instead, it is meant to be a space for brainstorming during the messy middle stage of creativity, when you are moving from a vague idea to a finished product.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="auQLcCjzQ5cz5zwdvRD94D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing cups, bowls and plates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/auQLcCjzQ5cz5zwdvRD94D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.11%;"><img id="Bopk3yVmMUdGjfFoLpfr7D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing a dog in different costumes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bopk3yVmMUdGjfFoLpfr7D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="606" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.02%;"><img id="RdDWM2jXZ3FosvRxJvDT9D" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard showing different DIY ideas for jeans embroidery" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RdDWM2jXZ3FosvRxJvDT9D.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="605" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="GzofHU78uKssWYPeDNCNvC" name="Google-Mixboard-canvas" alt="Google Mixboard" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzofHU78uKssWYPeDNCNvC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="607" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google frames Mixboard as an ideation engine rather than a final design tool.

Like these platforms, Mixboard offers a visually focused, collaborative experience, but it stands out by including generative AI from the beginning.</p><p>This blend of AI and visual boards turns Mixboard into a design canvas that reacts to your ideas in real time. The app is especially approachable for non-designers, since AI lowers the barrier to producing mood boards and creative drafts without specialized skills.</p><p>For now, Mixboard is a work in progress. It’s an experiment with rough edges. But its debut signals a broader move from Google to push AI beyond text and search, into tools that reflect how people actually brainstorm and think visually.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Think of it as an upgrade to the current Google Lens, and Google's way of pushing Gemini's multimodal capabilities onto more platforms.</p><p>With "Live Search," users can have real-time, interactive conversations with Google Search in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://search.google/ways-to-search/ai-mode/" target="_blank">AI Mode</a>, much like speaking to the AI chatbot on Gemini Live. This feature allows users to share their phone's camera feed, and they will have the ability to respond to your questions in real time. Since this feature is tied to AI Mode, it will also provide links for intensive research as well.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5oa-TzWXE8k" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>For instance, you'd like to know how you can make a cup of matcha — all users have to do is open the Google app (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en_US&pli=1" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942" target="_blank">iOS</a>) and tap the new "Live" icon under the search bar. Then point the camera at the equipment in your matcha set and ask what each tool is used for. Or you could even ask it questions for a deeper understanding of matcha's history or its rise to fame as a beverage.</p><p>It can also come in handy when you're on vacation and want to have a hands-free conversation with someone about the best spots around the neighborhood to explore. Users can even use the Live option on the go to help them translate or give them more information on anything they see. It's practically a personal assistant in your pocket that can help you with quick fixes or if you need help with an assignment.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5dH2iqt0wY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google says that users can start asking questions out loud and enable video input to share visual context from their camera feed. This feature extends into  Google Lens as well. Now, you can go a step further and click on the Live option within Lens to have an instant back-and-forth conversation about whatever you see in front of you, instead of clicking a picture and waiting for Google Lens to do its job.</p><p>The Live Search option is available to all Android and iOS users in the U.S. starting Sept. 24. Accessing this feature appears significantly easier within the Google app itself, as opposed to navigating to Gemini, then selecting Gemini Live, and finally activating your camera.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Beginning this week, once you've downloaded the patch, users receiving messages in another language can long-press that text and tap the new "Translate" button. WhatsApp states users will have to choose the language  the message should be translated "from or to, and download it to be saved for future translations."</p><p>The post stresses the privacy side of WhatsApp, informing users that whatever is translated is done on your device, adding that the service "cannot see them."</p><p>Once this patch hits Android, WhatsApp says those users can enable automatic translations for an entire chat, so everything is converted without your manual input. More importantly, this update brings translation support to Android for six languages: English, Spanish, Hindi, Portuguese, Russian, and Arabic. Those on iPhone will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/#translate-translate-app">receive support</a> for over 19 languages to start.</p><p>As this update makes its rounds, WhatsApp states you can activate message translation in one-on-one chats, groups, and Channel updates.</p><h2 id="whatsapp-rolls-on-2">WhatsApp rolls on</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi" name="WhatsApp-logo.jpg" alt="WhatsApp logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MLW4pP4msh72zT9ah2AGi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There have been some notable WhatsApp updates so far, as during the summer, the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-unread-texts-message-summaries-meta-ai-rollout">rolled out message summaries</a>.

The switch to a fully-custom design — made possible with the Nuvia acquisition — gave Qualcomm a distinct advantage, and it's making effective use of that this year.</p><p>Awkward naming aside, the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 delivers considerable upgrades to last year, with Qualcomm touting a huge 20% increase in CPU performance, while somehow simultaneously hitting 35% better efficiency. It's clear that Qualcomm set out to establish itself as the dominant chip vendor with the introduction of the platform, and early benchmarking tests indicate just how much of a lead the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 has this year over devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">Vivo X200 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> models.</p><p>My colleague Derrek Lee is at the annual Snapdragon Summit in Hawaii, and he was able to use a Qualcomm reference device powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 to run synthetic benchmarks.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-domineering-cpu-performance-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Domineering CPU performance</h2><p>Let's start with Geekbench; the utility does a good job emulating real-world usage scenarios, and it's a decent predictor of how fast a chipset is. Qualcomm and MediaTek always did well in this area when they used standard Arm cores, but Apple came in and took the overall lead by leveraging a custom design. That's why A series silicon dominated Geekbench charts for the better part of the last six years.</p><p>With the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, Qualcomm is once again asserting its dominance. The chipset managed to get 12,170 in Geekbench's multi-core tests, and that's wild — that's at least 15% better than anything else available today. Even the latest A19 Pro silicon only goes up to 10,500, signaling the gulf that exists between Qualcomm and the rest of the field.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</p></td><td  ><p>3,832</p></td><td  ><p>3,133</p></td><td  ><p>2381</p></td><td  ><p>2288</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</p></td><td  ><p>12,170</p></td><td  ><p>9,479</p></td><td  ><p>7175</p></td><td  ><p>6030</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>It's a similar story with single-core results as well. With a result of 3,832 in Geekbench 6, Qualcomm is showing that it's able to hold onto the lead in this category. Qualcomm isn't going into too much detail about the internals of the Oryon cores and the underlying architecture, but seeing as how it underpins the chip vendor's computing efforts — both on mobile and PC — it's evident just how much of an impact a custom design has. That's not a new thing; Apple has shown time and again that it's able to deliver in this area, both with the A series silicon and its M range of chipsets that it uses on MacBooks and iPads.</p><p>With Qualcomm doubling down on its custom design, it has an outsized lead in the context of Android phones. MediaTek's Dimensity, Google Tensor, and Samsung Exynos all use regular Arm cores, and while they're great in their own right — I'm excited to see what Arm's C1 Ultra and C1 Pro manage to offer with the Dimensity 9400 — but it's likely that the gains won't be as high as what Qualcomm is delivering this year.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-adreno-blazes-ahead-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5: Adreno blazes ahead</h2><p>Qualcomm is making decent inroads with the Adreno GPU as well, touting 23% improved performance alongside 20%better efficiency. We usually see these kinds of gains when a chip vendor moves to a new node, but Qualcomm is using the same 3nm TSMC node as last year, making the improvements all the more impressive.</p><p>Another interesting highlight is that Qualcomm now offers Unreal Engine 5 integration with its mobile chipset, making it easier to get console-quality games on Android. This has been an area where Apple had a distinct advantage thanks to its vertical integration, and Qualcomm is aiming to address that. We'll have to wait and see if it leads to any meaningful change when it comes to Android gaming — I'm yet to play a decent title with ray tracing — but Qualcomm is putting in the legwork.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Qualcomm reference device</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X200 Pro</p></th><th  ><p>Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</p></td><td  ><p>8,393</p></td><td  ><p>6,954</p></td><td  ><p>6,070</p></td><td  ><p>3,182</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>50.26</p></td><td  ><p>41.64</p></td><td  ><p>36.35</p></td><td  ><p>19.05</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>3DMark's Wild Like Extreme showcases the gains on offer this year. While these benchmarks aren't indicative of real-world use, they allow us to see how much things change year-on-year, and the results showcase the potential of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. We are coming to a point where it isn't the hardware, but the quality of the games that's the bottleneck on Android.</p><p>I'm excited to get my hands on devices powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5. Phone manufacturers don't tend to wait too long before releasing devices, with Xiaomi, Realme, and Honor slated to roll out phones featuring Qualcomm's latest silicon in the coming weeks. With the Dimensity 9500-powered OPPO Find X9 Pro also debuting globally soon, we don't have to wait too long to see how Qualcomm and MediaTek's chipsets hold up in real-world scenarios. Until then, Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 benchmarks suggest next year's flagships should be highly interesting.</p> ]]></dc:content>

All price hikes are said to go into effect on October 21. Both of the standalone Disney Plus plans are going up, moving from $9.99 to $11.99 for its basic with ads plans and $15.99 to $18.99 for its Premium (no ads) version.</p><p>When we get to the Disney Plus, Hulu, HBO Max bundles, those are set to go up, too. The support page states that the bundle with ads, currently for $16.99 a month, will rise to $19.99 per month on October 21. This hike extends to the no-ads version, going from $29.99 per month to $32.99.</p><p>The final major bundle, the one with Disney Plus, Hulu, and ESPN, isn't getting a price hike <em>everywhere</em>, but there are still changes consumers should know. Disney isn't increasing the monthly charge for its "Disney Plus, Hulu Bundle Premium," "Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited Bundle," or the "Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Unlimited Bundle Premium."</p><p>Price hikes will fall into the following bundles:</p><ul><li>Disney Plus, Hulu Bundle (with ads): $10.99 to $12.99</li><li>Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle (with ads): $16.99 to $19.99</li><li>Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle Premium (no ads): $26.99 to $29.99</li><li>Disney Plus Premium, Hulu, ESPN Select Bundle Legacy (no ads on Disney): $21.99 to $24.99</li></ul><h2 id="oh-yet-again-2">Oh, yet again...</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="ywMwrtVA9zjgedHwenqeHF" name="disney-plus-logo.jpg" alt="Disney+ logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywMwrtVA9zjgedHwenqeHF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1820" height="1213" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Disney+)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication shed some light on a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783489/disney-plus-streaming-subscription-price-increase">The Verge</a> regarding this Disney Plus price hike. The post highlights Marisa Kaba (journalist) on Bluesky, who had an alleged inside scoop about this, and it seems the recent removal of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, which has since returned to ABC, caused the service to drop subscribers at an incredible rate. Moreover, Kaba reports that Disney and ABC moved to quickly bring the late-night show back because of this planned price hike.</p><p>Kaba adds, "With subscriptions hemorrhaging since last week, they couldn’t risk losing more users with this announcement."</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the first time Disney Plus subscribers have gone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-disney-plus-price-increase-goes-into-effect-this-week-heres-how-to-keep-your-current-rate">through this price hike scenario</a>, and it's all feeling like a time loop by this point. The service raised prices in December 2022 for its Premium plans, Legacy bundles, and other Hulu, ESPN bundles. Fast-forward to 2023 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-hulu-are-raising-prices-again">the service raised prices</a>—again—for its bundles and other ad-free plans.</p><p>The only thing consistent, other than the fact that the past few years have had price hikes, is that Disney tends to do them late in the year, between October and December. While these hikes have been confirmed on its support page, the service is sure to begin emailing users or informing you in the app about how the hikes will affect your specific plan.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's designed for capturing professional-quality video that's perceptually (not really) lossless on a device as small as a smartphone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-could-challenge-iphone-with-pro-grade-video-tools">As rumored</a>, it is supported by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/rumored-snapdragon-8-elite-name-change-confusing">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip and ready for prime time.</p><p>As a "pro" video codec, it's pretty light on resources. It has very efficient compression (meaning it shrinks files in a smart way that looks good) while not needing much computational power. That makes it perfect for a phone with inherently low computational power because of size and temperature restraints.</p><p>On the feature side, the codec carries <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-hdr">HDR 10/10+ metadata</a>, supports up to 8K video with high-bandwidth processing (it's fast), and is optimized for multi-CPU and GPU devices.

You just answered the question.</p><p>A big deal will be made about this, just as it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-la/106396" target="_blank">when Apple did it</a>. That's because it is a big deal and a darn marvel of software engineering. It just has a very limited user base.</p><p>Regardless of what device manufacturers try to tell you, professional, commercial-grade video is not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">taken by people using a phone</a>. You may find a few clips mixed into something that <em>are</em> phone video, but a "cheap" device like even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best phone</a> simply can't compare to a proper video camera. A codec doesn't change or dictate that. Physics does.</p><p>Having said that, most of us know "that guy." You might even be that guy — the person who makes taking videos with his or her phone more than a hobby and really geeks out over it all. This is for that guy, and it's an awesome feature.</p><p>Now we don't know how this works in real life just yet, and I'm going to assume everything will go as planned, and using APV won't make phones overheat or kill a battery in 12 minutes. You know, the optimistic route.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n" name="Snapdragon-logo-water" alt="The Snapdragon logo sitting above water in a pool next to the ocean in Maui" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SPZiqduU9qWPUXB9Jcd65n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The "prosumer" phone camera enthusiast knows they won't see a world of difference visually. This doesn't change how the video looks, per se, just how efficiently it can be captured and worked with later. For that, this should be a treat, and the end result may very well look better because of it.</p><p>Videos captured should be able to retain more information, which means the editing software has more data to work with. A video editing app is like Google or Amazon and loves having a mountain of data to sort through. An efficient, "lossless", high-bandwidth capture codec means the editing process can spend more time on tweaking the visuals and have more picture information to use while doing it.</p><p>This will make a difference, but only if you're "that guy" and know how and why you want to use it.</p><p>So far, APV support is limited to only Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 (my god these names) powered devices. More information about phones sporting the latest chip will be coming, and it's possible that support will carry down to Qualcomm's more mid-range Snapdragon chips sometime in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Despite having many cool, affordable, and customizable Android smartwatches available, iPhone owners have been largely limited to Apple Watches, as other brands have struggled to match the same level of compatibility. But that could be changing soon.</p><p>Apple seems to be making these changes under the hood, as a recent deep dive into iOS 26.1's beta code, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.macworld.com/article/2917201/ios-26-1-beta-suggests-the-iphone-will-soon-support-third-party-smartwatches.html">Macworld</a> appears to have spotted notification support for third-party smartwatches. The website noted that the latest iOS beta code showed up with an unreleased "Notification Forwarding" feature, which allows iPhone users to pick a third-party device/ accessory other than the iPhone to show their notifications on.</p><p>But here's the catch: within the strings of the code, there's a restriction on this feature that suggests that notifications can only be forwarded to “one accessory at a time,” which means that you'd have to disable notifications on your Apple Watch in case you want to see them on your third-party accessory, which is what most people would do if they own two watches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN" name="Apple Watch Series 10" alt="Apple Watch Series 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fMN3H8jBZ2phCEXWxyMuuN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website adds that the beta has references to new abilities concerning accessory pairing, including one called “AccessoryExtension.” This again hints at third-party device pairing, which seems to be in the initial stages of development.</p><p>That said, there's little to no information on whether this feature would roll out globally or would be restricted to certain regions. However, it is highly likely that this feature could come to the EU region first, considering the DMA (Digital Markets Act) basically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">forced Apple</a> to make exclusive Apple Watch features available on third-party watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/competition/digital_markets_act/cases/202512/DMA_100203_1536.pdf" target="_blank">DMA decision on March 19</a> lists out how Apple must provide "effective interoperability" to let any connected device "receive, access, use, respond to, and transmit iOS notifications as well as to select and manage which notifications are displayed."</p><p>Apple's upcoming iOS update, expected in October, will likely introduce this feature that extends basic notification support to all third-party smartwatches — including devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Samsung's Galaxy Watch</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> out there, but it may not work as seamlessly as an Apple Watch would with an iPhone. So that's still a bargain that users should be willing to make.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d9b17cd0-9cab-415f-84d3-adeb33293d89">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EsJNwXE22phiafcE9ZTFKA.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Bold swing</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic offers Watch 6 Classic owners a faster, efficient Exynos processor, new health sensors with perks like Antioxidant Index and Vascular Load, dual-band GPS, doubled storage, and a blazing 3,000 nits of brightness.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>
