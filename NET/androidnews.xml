<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Hidden code in the latest Google TV Streamer update suggests built-in support for backlit remotes might be on the way.</li><li>Code reveals options for "Never," "Standard" (lights up for 5 seconds), and "Scheduled" (only from 6 PM to 6 AM).</li><li>It is being speculated that Google could be working on a premium remote that will support this feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The new Google TV Streamer update has some hidden code that points to built-in support for backlit remotes in the works, hinting at possible new hardware additions to the Google TV lineup.</p><p>While most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> devices stick with basic, non-backlit remotes, there are a few exceptions. A few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-4k-tvs-chromecast">high-end TVs</a> with built-in Google TV and some models, like the Walmart Onn Pro, already come with backlit remotes. Still, getting them to work smoothly on Google TV usually means relying on custom tweaks from the manufacturers.</p><p>On the other hand, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> doesn’t come with a backlit remote, but it looks like Google might be tuning in to what users have been asking for.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.aftvnews.com/google-tv-is-gaining-native-remote-backlight-controls-could-a-new-premium-remote-be-coming/" target="_blank">AFTVNews</a>, the recent Google TV Streamer update includes code mentioning backlight support for compatible remotes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-tv-settings-for-backlit-remotes/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>). The feature is tucked away in the Settings app code and isn’t accessible just yet.</p><p>Most Google TV devices come with basic, non-backlit remotes. It might seem like a small thing, but throw in some backlighting, and suddenly your late-night binge sessions get a whole lot easier.</p><p>The latest update reveals code for three backlight modes: "Never" (always off), "Standard" (lights up for five seconds after a button press), and "Scheduled" (same as Standard but only between 6 PM and 6 AM).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:58.10%;"><img id="Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg" name="Google-TV-backlit-remote-support" alt="strings of code in a Google TV Streamer update hinting at support for backlit remotes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ett3gyUKUATJzBrTxVvfpg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="580" height="337" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AFTVNews)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, finding this feature in the code doesn’t mean it’s definitely coming. Plenty of times, stuff like this gets spotted but never actually makes it to users, or it takes forever to show up.</p><p>At present, backlit remotes on Google TV and Android TV depend on third-party manufacturers. The potential native support for this feature could make things easier for manufacturers and boost the availability of backlit remotes.</p><p>While these code changes hint at wider support for backlit remotes, it’s unclear if the Google TV Streamer will get in on the action. AFTVNews is tossing around the idea that Google might be working on a shiny new premium remote, which could be something to keep an eye on.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The new Samsung Galaxy S25 series is arguably as much about fresh software features as it is about upgraded hardware. Yes, there's a new Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and other improvements, but Galaxy AI tricks and One UI 7's visual overhaul are just as crucial. To get the most out of your new Galaxy S25, you'll absolutely want to do these six things first.</p><p>Aside from the latest Galaxy AI tools, Samsung also made changes to One UI 7 that you'll want to customize to make your own. Whether you're a longtime Samsung user or you're new to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Galaxy phones</a>, this list highlights everything you need to try with your Galaxy S25 — and it covers the Galaxy S25, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p>

<h2 id="1-change-your-lock-screen-notification-preferences-2">1. Change your lock screen notification preferences</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-lock-screen" alt="View of the lock screen on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GKP2f3qt6z2YRUiDrhbPL7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The very first thing you should do after setting up your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> is check your lock screen notification settings. Samsung made a questionable change with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25, making the default setting for lock screen notifications "Icons" rather than "Cards." Essentially, this means your phone will buzz and buzz by default while not showing notifications — with only minuscule status bar icons appearing.</p><p>To save you from pulling your hair out trying to figure out what's wrong, open up the <strong>Settings app</strong> and head over to the <strong>Notifications </strong>page. Tap <strong>Lock screen notifications</strong>, and pick either <strong>Dot</strong>, <strong>Icons</strong>, or <strong>Cards</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.00%;"><img id="YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg" name="how-to-change-lock-screen-notifications-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="How to change lock screen notifications on Galaxy S25 and One UI 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YRQA2VyJuvfoJv2ojNs2Kg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2000" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any option is fine, but pay attention to the graphics that show how each setting will change how your notifications appear. Making this choice early can save a lot of headaches down the road. Pretty much every Samsung Galaxy S25 reviewer became initially confused by this perplexing tweak, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-one-change-almost-ruined-the-galaxy-s25-ultra-for-me">as we unpacked in-depth here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="2-curate-your-now-brief-settings-2">2. Curate your Now Brief settings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-3" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2RRfCrPeXza8RW2cdMpQaF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone"><strong>Now Bar</strong></a> and <strong>Now Brief</strong> with the Galaxy S25, and they dynamically change to show you the information you need throughout the day. By default, the Now Brief can be pretty sparse, only showing the weather and perhaps a news story or two. To make the Now Brief more unique to you, navigate to <strong>Galaxy AI</strong> > <strong>Now Brief </strong>in the Settings app.</p><p>The first option you'll see is a toggle called <strong>Expand Now Brief without unlocking</strong>, which makes the Now Brief accessible by tapping the Now Bar on your lock screen. However, some of the more helpful tweaks are under the <strong>Content to include</strong> tab. You can toggle each of the following Now Brief content types either on or off based on your preferences:</p>
<ul><li>Health and Wellness</li><li>Travel</li><li>Events and tasks</li><li>Routines</li><li>Digital Wellbeing</li><li>Communication</li><li>Moments</li><li>Gallery stories</li><li>Traffic updates</li><li>News</li><li>Smart home</li><li>Music and podcasts</li><li>YouTube Shorts</li></ul>
<p>This will help ensure the Now Brief is showing the things you want — and avoiding the things you don't. Like with any of these Galaxy AI features, personalization is key.</p>
<h2 id="3-create-gifs-with-ai-select-2">3. Create GIFs with AI Select</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX" name="ai-select-icons-sidebar-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="AI Select in sidebar on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esQjsLPHXvRfKmB5amLHxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>GIFs are great for sharing on social media, but they're often hard to make without dedicated third-party tools. It's easy to make anything into a GIF with the Samsung Galaxy S25 using a feature called <strong>AI Select</strong>. Once you have something on your screen you want to use to make a GIF, swipe from the right of the screen to open the <strong>Edge panel</strong>. From there, tap <strong>AI Select</strong> at the top of the list.</p><p>Then, select something on your screen, and tap <strong>Create GIF</strong>. When you're ready, tap <strong>Record</strong>, and everything you do on your selected portion of your screen will become a GIF. You'll have 30 seconds to record, or you can press the <strong>Stop</strong> button to end things early.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb" name="AI-Select-Create-GIF" alt="Creating a GIF with AI Select on the Samsung Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6SwRSs8SWxdmiYm4oRDmkb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're finished, make sure you tap either the <strong>Copy</strong>, <strong>Share</strong>, or <strong>Download</strong> icons — GIFs aren't saved automatically. This is one of the more underrated features on the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. It's simple, but it makes turning a video into a GIF surprisingly easy.</p>
<h2 id="4-use-multimodal-ai-to-generate-images-with-drawing-assist-2">4. Use multimodal AI to generate images with Drawing Assist</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HbvT9jcNdUQrvCx76rhbaj" name="sketch-to-image-results-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Sketch to Image results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HbvT9jcNdUQrvCx76rhbaj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similar to AI Select, there's an AI Drawing Assist feature you'll want to use after getting started with your Galaxy S25. If you've used Sketch to Image, AI Drawing Assist will feel quite familiar. It's basically Sketch to Image but with multimodal input support. That means you can remix a photo with a drawing or text or generate an AI image from a note and text instructions.</p><p>The way it works is simple. You can access AI Drawing Assist from anywhere by swiping the <strong>Edge panel</strong> open, and tapping the third option in the list. After you select something, tap <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> and either draw or enter a text prompt of what you want to change. Then, tap <strong>Generate</strong> and watch Galaxy AI work its magic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iT5rC7GEMyR3cViAGste9j" name="Drawing-Assist-Sidebar" alt="Screenshots for using AI Drawing Assist in Samsung apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iT5rC7GEMyR3cViAGste9j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the system-wide version of AI Drawing Assist, there are versions build specifically for the Samsung Gallery and Notes apps. The good news is that whenever you want to create a generative AI image, you can call up AI Drawing Assist without leaving the app you're currently using. We have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-samsung-galaxy-s25">complete guide to using AI Drawing Assist here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="5-use-gemini-for-multi-app-actions-2">5. Use Gemini for multi-app actions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-15" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy S25 outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kdfDyBSxTimtUY3xTAF4TF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is rolling out a supercharged version of Gemini, and it debuted on the Galaxy S25. It can now take actions on your behalf, coordinating between multiple apps with multiple steps. Try asking Gemini something like "Find me a movie theater nearby and text the address to mom." Then, the revamped version of Gemini can use Google Maps and Google Messages to take those actions off your hands, which is something it couldn't do before.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> is also better at understanding what's on your screen and its context. For example, if you trigger Gemini while watching a YouTube video, you can use the <strong>Ask about screen</strong> button to have it respond to your prompt in the right context. If it's been a while since you gave Gemini a proper look, your new Galaxy S25 is a good reason to try it again.</p>
<h2 id="6-remove-background-noise-with-audio-eraser-2">6. Remove background noise with Audio Eraser</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1348px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="sWaexXkkadKgSb5ocr8Akn" name="audio-eraser-galaxy-s25-ultra-demo-3" alt="Demo showing how Audio Eraser works on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWaexXkkadKgSb5ocr8Akn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1348" height="758" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We've long seen Google's Magic Eraser remove unwanted objects from photos, and Samsung may have took <em>slight</em> inspiration from that when it made the Object Eraser. Well, with the Galaxy S25, Samsung took a bit <em>more</em> inspiration from Google's Audio Magic Eraser. The Samsung Galaxy S25 offers a feature called Audio Eraser that can remove unwanted background noise from videos — and it'll even let you pick which sounds to erase.</p><p>In the Samsung Gallery app, you'll have the option of removing sounds like <strong>Voices</strong>, <strong>Noise</strong>, and <strong>Music</strong>. With a slider, you can adjust how aggressively Audio Eraser should mute these sounds. It's possible to compare the edited version to the original until you're pleased with the results. This could come in handy, especially in loud and crowded environments. If you want to play around with the feature on your new flagship, we have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">complete guide to Audio Eraser here</a>.</p>

<p>It turns out that plenty of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features Samsung added to the Galaxy S25 series are pretty neat. Throughout my time <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the base Galaxy S25</a>, my favorite feature happened to be AI Select — creating GIFs has always been too difficult, and this phone makes it painless.</p><p>After you've tried out everything on this list — which applies to all Galaxy S25 models — there are a few more things you should check out if you have a Galaxy S25 Plus or Galaxy S25 Ultra.

<p>Okay, the headline might be a little harsh, but I feel like the Play Store has evolved (or devolved) into one of those massive indoor flea markets with every square inch packed to the point that it's spilled out into the parking lot with people setting up tables.</p><p>To continue this random but apt analogy, you'll head over and see the same stores that have been there for years. You'll also see a few newcomers who are trying to fit in while offering a bunch of goodies for cheap. Then, there are those who don't fully understand the concept of a "flea market" and are there for all of the wrong reasons.</p><p>This is pretty much how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">Play Store</a> shakes out, with many of the usual suspects holding ground in the "Top Charts." Occasionally, a new app or game will slowly (or quickly) arrive with a lot of excitement before nestling in with the rest and bumping others out. Then, we have the nefarious apps. The ones that have a nice coat of paint, but are only there to either drain your Play Store balance or worse.</p><p>Thankfully, there are a few trusted Play Store alternatives that I've been enjoying to help make finding apps exciting again.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5" name="top-charts-play-store-s25-ultra" alt="Top Charts in the Play Store on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first problem comes with actually finding apps. As of early February 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://42matters.com/google-play-statistics-and-trends">42matters claims</a> there are almost 2.1 million apps on the Play Store. Apparently, more than 1,100 new apps are published every day, with an average of almost 42,000 apps arriving every month. This brings me to my first issue with the Play Store — search.</p><p>How is it that a search engine can be so bad at search? Sure, it works fine if you know the name of the app that you're looking for. But try to search for "KWGT" or "icon packs." You'll get plenty of results, but there's no rhyme or reason for how the options are displayed. And it's not like you can just sort by "recently updated" or by the highest rating.</p><p>Of course, this problem really only surfaces when searching for more broad terms, but it's still something that drives me crazy. It also drives me crazy that, with some app listings, it's practically impossible to see the last time that it was updated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5" name="play-pass-halls-of-torment-pokemon-silver-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Play Pass on the S25 Ultra with Halls of Torment on the Odin 2 and Pokemon Silver on the Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWhvh7FUSaHBrtsrkQQgF5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Speaking of which, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to open and use an app, only to have to wait for it to be updated, despite the fact that it <em>should have been</em> updated overnight while my phone was charging and while I was asleep. No, it's not some game-breaking problem, but if I check the box for an app or my phone to do something, I expect it to be done.</p><p>Oh, and don't even get me started on games. One of the biggest reasons why I'm still subscribed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-games-google-play-pass">Play Pass</a> is that it surfaces games that aren't just looking for ways to extract as much patience and money from me as possible. Which is exactly what most of the "Top Charts" consist of anymore. It's not entirely Google's fault, but both Apple and Google are a bit to blame here.</p>
<h2 id="stepping-into-the-world-of-foss-2">Stepping into the world of FOSS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1979px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ogWwAvCtsiVcbvAfqUEvEW" name="f-droid-website-samsung-s25-ultra" alt="F-Droid website on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ogWwAvCtsiVcbvAfqUEvEW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1979" height="1113" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wouldn't ya know, for the 2.1 million apps on the Play Store, there's a whole world of apps that are available. Many of which are FOSS or "free and open source software," and are just a few taps away.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://f-droid.org/en/">F-Droid</a> is probably something you've heard of before, as it's essentially the Play Store for FOSS apps. The only "catch" is that you first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-sideloading">need to sideload</a> the F-Droid app or one of the clients like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store">Neo Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Droid-ify/client/releases">Droid-ify</a>. And honestly, you'll probably want to try out Neo Store or Droid-ify because the F-Droid app itself looks rather archaic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ytsrCpM3kzEtQkJPEhX4E5" name="scrcpy-android-droid-ify-s25-ultra" alt="Scrcpy for Android app listing in Droid-ify on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ytsrCpM3kzEtQkJPEhX4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is where my anti-Play Store journey began, as there really are a lot of fantastic open-source apps that don't get the recognition they deserve. Yes, there's a lot more digging and nuance involved, but in the end, it's well worth it.</p><p>But what if you're like me and have a curated list of open-source apps that you want to download and keep updated? Well, that's where Obtainium comes in.</p>
<h2 id="obtainium-to-the-rescue-2">Obtainium to the rescue</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MsJEAsPt5eYktJVJPjLXE5" name="obtainium-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg" alt="Obtainium website on the Odin 2 with the app on the S25 Ultra and Pocket DMG" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MsJEAsPt5eYktJVJPjLXE5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I first learned about Obtainium early last year, as I was expanding my knowledge of retro gaming on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a>. See, there are a decent number of recommended and reliable emulators on the Play Store, but there are even more that aren't. At the time, this was before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Nintendo wrecked Switch emulation</a>, so Obtainium made it easy to keep Yuzu and its forks updated.</p><p>With Obtainium, you're able to bypass F-Droid or the Play Store and get apps and updates directly from the source. However, there are "over a dozen source websites, including GitHub, GitLab, and F-Droid."</p><p>The process of adding apps can still be tedious, especially if the majority of them come from GitHub and you end up bumping up against the rate limit. That can be solved by signing up for a GitHub and/or GitLab account and generating a Personal Access Token that is added to Obtainium.</p><p>However, there's also a solution to being able to keep the list of apps across devices, without needing to manually add them every time. Obtainium lets you export the list of apps that you've curated, complete with any specific information that you've added such as the name or category. So as long as you keep the exported JSON file backed up, you can just download Obtainium and import the list when you get a new Android device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5" name="obtainium-updates-notification-odin-2" alt="Update notification from Obtainium on the Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X5MLwehvqGcnp2ZecisgC5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The fun doesn't stop there, however, as you can also add things and set them to "Track-Only." With this, you'll be notified when there's a new release, but it's not actually an app that can be downloaded. I use this to keep track of when new drivers are released, along with tracking multiple forks of the same app.</p><p>Because I've been getting more and more open-source apps, and not just the ones on Android, I've also started using GitHub more and more. So, when I learned that I could create a repo and upload my exported list of apps, I got pretty excited.</p><p>This way, I don't have to try to remember what cloud storage service I uploaded it to while keeping my "open source world" tied together quite nicely. Plus, there are a bunch of "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/">crowdsourced app configurations</a>" that can be added with just a couple of taps.</p><p>Look, I know that this isn't a path that many will venture down, and it's okay if you don't really have issues with the Play Store. But if you're like me and want something better, and that gives you more control, definitely check out Obtainium.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Teams-to-Chat migration tool is now fully live for everyone.</li><li>Workspace admins can move entire Teams chat histories to Google Chat.</li><li>Migration requires linking a Microsoft account and uploading CSV files for channels and user mapping.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google recently introduced a new tool that makes switching from Microsoft Teams to Google Chat a breeze, and it’s now open to everyone.</p><p>After rolling out in open beta last December, Google’s Microsoft Teams to Google Chat migration tool is now fully live. A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/02/release-notes-02-14-2025.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> confirms that Workspace admins can now move entire Teams chat histories over to Google Chat (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/google-chat-wants-to-help-you-dump-microsoft-teams-for-good" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p><p>First, link up your Microsoft account to start the migration process. You’ll need to upload a CSV file with the list of Teams channels you want to move over. If you’ve got specific email addresses in Teams that need to match up with Google Chat, you can toss in a second CSV file to map those out.</p><p>Keep in mind that the migration only works if the users already have accounts in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace</a> and have Google Chat enabled. Once that’s sorted, pick the starting date for the messages you want to bring over. Hit go, and the tool will start moving your data.</p><p>When it’s done, all your migrated spaces, messages, and chat history will be live and ready for the right users in Google Workspace.</p><p>After the migration wraps up, admins can access detailed reports that highlight any hiccups like skipped content, errors, or warnings that popped up along the way.</p>

<p>Workspace admins can start moving Teams chat data over to Google Chat right away. And if you’re looking to shift other types of data from different services, Google’s got your back with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/6003169" target="_blank">helpful guides</a>.</p><p>Only folks who have both Google Super Admin and Microsoft Teams Global Admin roles can pull off this migration.</p><p>If your organization is stuck using both platforms (or other tools), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-chat-now-works-with-slack-and-microsoft-teams">Mio can help make them play nice together</a>, as per TechRadar. Google even gave Mio a thumbs-up last year, backing it as a go-to for linking Teams, Zoom, and other video calling platforms.</p>

<p>Google brought Gemini to iPhone through integration with the Google app first, and only created a dedicated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> for iOS in November 2024. However, Gemini support within the Google app for iOS remained available. Now that the Gemini app for iOS has been available for many months, Gemini is no longer available in the Google app on iPhone.</p><p>Google announced the change in an email to Gemini users on iOS late Tuesday, Feb. 18.</p><p>"We’re making some changes to create an even better Gemini experience on iOS," the company wrote in the email.

The company says that the dedicated Gemini app for iOS supports all the same features that were once accessible in the Google app for iOS. More recently, the Gemini app for iOS has been updated to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-android-auto-chat-summary-brief-spotted">Gemini Live</a> in more languages for conversational chatting, and its latest update is <strong>version 1.2025.0570102</strong>.</p><p>The Gemini app for iOS also brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-update-brings-2-0-flash-experimental-model-and-google-home-photos-extensions-to-ios-app">additional support for Gemini extensions</a> for apps like Google Maps and YouTube.</p>

<p>If you try to use the Gemini panel in the Google app on iOS now, it will show a screen that reads: "Gemini has its own app. Download the Gemini app for iPhone." Presumably, the Gemini panel will soon be removed from the Google app for iOS altogether.</p>

<p>Emergency SOS is a life-saving feature on wearables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Google Pixel Watch</a>, but it runs the risk of diverting resources from real emergencies due to accidental triggers. As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-confirmation-update-explained">Google announced last month</a> that it would be adding an extra step to the Emergency SOS process in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/320517148/emergency-sos-with-touch-and-hold-confirmation-on-pixel-watch" target="_blank">community post</a>. Now, this change appears to be widely available on Pixel Watch following an update.</p><p>An updated version of the Personal Safety app for Wear OS, carrying version number <strong>2025.01.23.721858245.2-release-wear</strong>, brings the change to all Pixel Watch models in supported regions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/18/pixel-watch-emergency-sos-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.safetyhub&pli=1" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> listing for the app has also been updated to reflect this tweak, and notes that the Personal Safety app for Android phones also has the extra step for Emergency SOS.</p><p>By default, pressing the Pixel Watch crown five times consecutively or more will call up the Emergency SOS screen — but you'll now need to touch and hold the Pixel Watch screen for three seconds to start a call with emergency services. If you don't complete the "press and hold" requirement within 20 seconds, the Emergency SOS screen will be closed automatically to avoid accidentally triggering a call.</p>

<p>The change is designed to make it "less likely to accidentally trigger an Emergency SOS call during activities like exercise, while ensuring fast and easy access to initiate a call when you need it the most," the company explained in the original community post.</p><p>Google is also making it optional to manually set your Pixel Watch to call emergency services after a five-second countdown, eliminating the "touch and hold" requirement. Users can change this by opening up the settings on their Pixel Watch,  and navigating to <strong>Safety and emergency</strong> > <strong>Emergency SOS</strong>. From there, tap<strong> Ways to start SOS</strong> and choose<strong> Automatically call</strong>.</p><p>Per usual, the feature requires location sharing and a network connection, and is limited to supported countries and regions.

<ul><li>Nothing will offer a 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Phone 3a series, in a first for the company.</li><li>The Nothing Phone 3a will offer four cameras total, with three being 50MP sensors.</li><li>The main and front-facing cameras support 4K video recording.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In typical Nothing fashion, the company is teasing its way toward the official launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">Nothing Phone 3a series</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">which will happen Tuesday, March 4</a>. Ahead of that unveiling, Nothing gave fans a preview of the Nothing Phone 3a camera system in a YouTube video comparing it to the latest iPhone 16 camera system. Notably, it includes a few major upgrades over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a lineup</a>.</p><p>Nothing says that the Phone 3a series will have a 50MP main camera sensor, which is designed to capture more light and more detail than its predecessor. That's one of three camera sensors on the Phone 3a with a 50MP size. You'll also get a 50MP front-facing camera and a 50MP rear periscope telephoto lens.</p><p>That last bit is important, because we don't often see high-quality telephoto cameras on midrange phones. The 50MP periscope telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a is said to offer 3x optical zoom, plus 6x "in-sensor zoom" — which likely uses sensor crop to provide optical-quality detail via digital zoom. It's also aiming to deliver "60x ultra zoom" on the Phone 3a.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_D_btmdrP9M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The final rear camera on the Nothing Phone 3a is an 8MP ultrawide camera. As such, the Phone 3a's camera arsenal will include a 50MP main sensor, a 50MP telephoto lens, and an 8MP ultrawide camera on the rear. Then, there will be a 50MP front-facing camera to round out the offerings. On paper, it seems to be a standout camera system for a midrange device.</p><p>Nothing adds that all four cameras support Ultra HDR for photos, with the main and front-facing cameras adding 4K recording with stabilization. There's also what Nothing calls the "TrueLens Engine 3.0," which "harnesses elite hardware to produce professional-grade, true-to-life photography through a combination of AI tone mapping and scene detection" and "understands every image and tunes it to strike a classic photographic balance with next-generation computational technology."</p><p>This isn't the first time Nothing has teased out Phone 3a details. It previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-qualcomm-soc-teaser-ceo-announcement">teased a return to a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip</a> for the lineup. For more, we'll have to wait until the official Phone 3a reveal on March 4.</p>

<ul><li>A tipster discovered code in the Google app's recent version, pointing toward a new auto-summary feature for Gemini Live.</li><li>The AI is supposedly preparing to support for summaries at the end of chats that are brief and straight to the point with titles and bullet points.</li><li>Gemini Live recently received file and image support on the Galaxy S25 series, as well as an update that improved its translation skills.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly preparing an update to Gemini that brings a little more convenience to its conversational uses.</p><p>The upcoming changes were spotted by AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-live-conversation-summaries-apk-3526918/">Android Authority</a>), who states Gemini Live could receive a chat "summarization" feature. In an APK dive of the Google app v16.6.23, the tipster states Google has added Gemini Live support for "automatic" chat summaries. These summaries will allegedly follow that same bite-sized trend of how Gemini Live delivers information to regular queries.</p><p>The post states Google's support for auto-summaries will "direct" Gemini Live to display content in a "brief, paragraph-style." The summaries will be broken down into titled, bullet point sections with short, one sentence explainers for users.</p><p>This is all contained in an overall section, which Gemini Live will supposedly give a title and brief overview about before delivering specific details. From the example, it seems Gemini Live will even resurface what it asked you (things about your interest or for extra context).</p><p>The APK dive didn't expand on whether Gemini Live's recent file support will be included in its automatic chat summaries.</p><p>The tipster also presumes Google could provide this automatic summarization feature at the end of Gemini Live chats.</p>

In January, users could begin submitting files, images, and YouTube videos to Gemini Live for feedback/information. For photos, users can submit one and ask "how's my composition?" Gemini Live will provide assistance for making it better and praise you for what looks good.</p><p>During its debut, Google highlighted that it's working to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra's</a> capabilities to the AI assistant, such as screen sharing and video streaming.</p><p>Further, in February, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">Gemini Live's update</a> brought an expansion of Google's intentions to make its conversational experience more "dynamic."

Again, the company previewed its upcoming screen sharing and video streaming capabilities, to which it highlighted changes to its data sharing.</p><p>Google states "As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your Gemini Apps Activity (if it’s on)."</p>

<p>Meta Connect 2025 begins on September 17, 2025. The 5th annual Meta conference will focus on Meta Quest headsets, AI glasses, and other AI developments. But you won't have to wait until the fall to learn more about Meta AI.</p><p>In the same Tuesday reveal, Meta announced LlamaCon, a developer conference focused on their open-source AI, Llama. It takes place on April 29, and Meta says it will share "the latest on our open source AI developments" to help devs "build amazing apps and products, whether as a start-up or at scale."</p><p>On Threads, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg shared this news, listing both dates and saying, "LlamaCon is a new event for developers building with Llama. See you there!" with a short video of an actual Llama wearing some kind of AI <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>.</p>

<p>We know from recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">Meta earnings</a> that the latest Llama 4 version should arrive soon, and that the company intends to spend a massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">$65 billion on AI in 2025</a>. A conference dedicated to announcing the new version and jumpstarting dev engagement with their Llama platform makes sense for Meta.</p><p>Meta has said the new Llama 4 will enable "a host of new product innovation in areas like speech and reasoning" in order to make Meta AI more voice-based, and that pivot will be an important one before Meta Connect 2025, which we believe will focus primarily on AI glasses.</p>

<p>Samsung's next foldables are expected later this summer, but these new rumors purport a positive upgrade.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-and-Galaxy-Z-Flip7-with-significantly-more-efficient-displays-Leaker-names-key-features-and-highlights.962127.0.html">NotebookCheck</a> highlighted a post by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/PandaFlashPro/status/1890286598627234114">PandaFlash</a>, which rolled through some supposed Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Fold 7 changes (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-could-have-better-battery-life-but-not-for-the-reason-you-might-expect">TechRadar</a>). According to the tipster, both foldables will see a "longer battery life" as they "consume less power" thanks to a Samsung display change. The tipster says this "highly efficient" tech change should aid both devices in lasting longer for users scrolling or gaming.</p><p>Supposedly, a test was conducted with the Fold 7, showing that it lasted roughly 55 minutes more with this new screen tech alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>.</p><p>The tipster moved into some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">rumored Flip 7-specific specs</a>, stating Samsung has "improved its hinge durability." The clamshell could see a slightly thinner body, "all-new flexible glass," which could lead to its supposed "less visible crease" compared to the next Fold. Samsung is rumored to have improved the Flip 7's charging speed, despite it's stagnant 25W charger.</p><p>PandaFlash claims the Fold 7 will see a 200MP primary camera and a slightly thinner build, too. This is supposedly based on a "prototype" of the book-style device.</p>

<p>Samsung may prefer to stick with the same battery and charger for its foldables, but improve on that foundation, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">kind of like its Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.

The Flip 7 could see a 6.8-inch internal display and a 4-inch cover screen. The Fold 7 could grab a bigger 8-inch main screen and a 6.5-inch cover. This is another area that Samsung has become pretty stale in so, hopefuly, this one proves true.</p><p>Tipster highlighted the Flip 7 and its cameras, claiming that consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/early-alleged-galaxy-z-flip-7-camera-specs-detailed">might not get too excited</a> about them this year.</p>

<hr>
<p>The leaks keep coming as another report claims to have revealed the specs of Google's upcoming budget Pixel.</p><p>The company's affordable Pixel 9a reportedly had its specifications leaked by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,148929.html">WinFuture</a> (German). The publication cites "available technical data," stating the Pixel 9a could hit the market with a 6.3-inch OLED display with a max 120Hz refresh rate. The panel allegedly supports HDR10 Plus, as well. The post includes a rumored look at the device in four colors; however, the highlight is this screen's bezels.</p><p>A glance suggests the Pixel 9a will have slightly thicker bezels compared to the flagship Pixel 9 series. The phone's leaked renders show a completely flat screen and sides alongside rounded corners — which stays within Google's theme.</p><p>The back is another area where we could see change as rumors continue to claim there's a dual-camera array in our future. Of course, this is similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">base Pixel 9</a>; however, the Pixel 9a could see a 48MP primary lens with OIS (optical image stabilization) and a 13MP ultrawide lens. These lenses contrast the vanilla Pixel 9's 50MP and 48MP alternatives.</p><p>What's more, the housing array is in focus as Google may drop the thick, protruding camera visor on the Pixel 9a. The renderings claim the array will be minimal and flush to the back panel for a near-flat surface.</p>

<p>Rumors add the phone may debut with a 5,100mAh battery, as well as a 128GB and a 256GB storage option with 8GB RAM across both. Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, which is packed into the flagship Pixel 9 series, is expected to power the Pixel 9a. Once again, the post reiterates colors we've seen before, like Obsidian, Porcelain, Peony, and Iris.</p><p>Lastly, the publication suggests the Pixel 9a could see a starting price of €499 in Europe (~$520).</p><p>The alleged specs of the Pixel 9a have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-leak-reveal-every-last-spec-of-the-handset">surfacing since December</a>, which is when we first got a glimpse of its potential contents. The current rumors double down on several aspects such as its 6.3-inch display, color options, usage of the Tensor G4, and primary camera strength. Curiously, the leaked pricing from last year claims the U.S. could see the same price tag as what's rumored for Europe: $499 for its base model. A rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-storage-options-leak">price hike was stated </a>for the larger 256GB option.</p><p>Regarding the renders, we've seen similar aesthetics and designs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/massive-pixel-9a-leak-reveals-official-looking-renders-color-options">leaked before</a> and those have remained consistent through the latest ones.</p><p>Google typically unveils the current series' A-series phone the following year (toward the spring) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-google-pixel-9as-exact-release-date-is-already-known-report-claims">recent rumors state</a> that could happen again. Speculation claims Google is preparing for a March 26 debut for the Pixel 9a with pre-orders opening one week beforehand (around March 19).</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Garmin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/outdoor/garmin-unveils-tactix-8-smartwatch-stay-active-stay-mission-ready/">unveiled</a> its new Tactix 8 watch last Thursday, designed specifically for military and reserve service members. One new, long-awaited feature is a "rucking" mode that lets you "input pack weight to better understand the physical exertion associated with rucking." And I'm already thinking about how Garmin can upgrade this feature.</p><p>Despite its origins in military training, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/rucking-workout-fad-is-fun-novelty-but-not-for-everyone">rucking</a> has grown as a civilian workout fad in recent years — carrying extra weight on hikes to build muscle and elevate your heart rate for extra training load — and I fully expect this mode to come to other Garmin watches in 2025 once the Tactix 8 gets its exclusivity window.</p><p>Whether or not you use the "Rucking" sport profile, Garmin has added a "pack weight feature" that lets you input how much weight you're carrying for other popular activities like trail running, hiking, and walking. Garmin says that any activity carrying 2kg or more will be disabled for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-i-boosted-my-vo2-max-score-on-my-garmin-watch">VO2 Max</a> recording.</p><p>While that might sound disappointing at first glance, this is a much-needed adjustment. Depending on your pack weight, your heart rate will climb into higher HR zones, especially on hills. With no context, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> would assume I'm in in worse shape than its algorithm originally suggested, and lower my VO2 Max.</p><p>I feared that rucking or adding pack weight wouldn't give me <em>any</em> training load because of this. Thankfully, a Garmin rep told me that, while "there is no direct adjustment to training load" when weight is added, "load would indirectly be affected by carrying weight due to HR inevitably being higher."</p><p>In other words, Garmin's Training Status and Training Readiness would still take a difficult workout into account, judging you to be overtraining if a hard rucking workout overtaxed your heart long enough to need rest. And you'll still get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a> credit. You'll just have to wait for your next non-weighted activity to try and raise your VO2 Max.</p>

<p>I'm eagerly anticipating this feature coming to watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>, and <em>hope</em> the company won't restrict such an essential tool from the mid-range or lower-end models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Garmin Instinct 3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Forerunner 165</a>. Garmin said they "cannot comment on a potential future roadmap" for this feature or others, but its watches usually get updated every quarter.</p><p>I know what you're thinking: If I'm excited about this and think Garmin went about adding rucking and pack weight the right way, what's the "upgrade" I'm already demanding from Garmin?</p><p>Garmin users will know of two recent metrics added to high-end models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-965-review">Forerunner 965</a>: Endurance Score and Hill Score. They both translate more generalized metrics like TL and VO2 Max into practical measurements of how your theoretical fitness level translates into real-world ability. The more you can sustain your pace for long paces or sprint up hills without a break, the higher your score.</p><p>My suggestion sounds simple, but might be challenging to pull off. I want a Pack Score, or a Grit Score, or maybe even a Muscle Score? I don't know what Garmin would call it; I simply know that it'd be awesome for Garmin to measure your muscular and cardiovascular ability to bear certain weights over time.</p>

<p>Garmin knows (via your VO2 Max and Hill/Endurance Scores) what your heart rate should be at any given pace, distance, or elevation gain. So if you start an activity with 10 pounds of weight, it should be able to compare your rucking HR against your <em>normal</em> HR and judge how well your body is bearing the weight.</p><p>I'd imagine that to get a Garmin rucking score, your watch would need you to bear a certain threshold of weight for a long enough stretch for it to determine your abilities. For future activities, bearing more weight might boost your score, but only if the weight doesn't push your HR too far from your VO2 Max baseline.</p><p>Over time, your Garmin rucking score would improve by three metrics: increasing your VO2 Max to handle the cardiovascular workload, decreasing the gap between your baseline HR and your weight-bearing HR, and increasing your max pack weight.</p><p>With enough data, Garmin's algorithm could determine your body's recommended pack weight range, with suggested activity lengths or Garmin Strength Coach workouts that could target the weight-bearing muscles necessary to improve.</p><p>Rucking enthusiasts don't necessarily need validation from a smartwatch; they know how much weight they can bear. But for anyone new to the sport, a Garmin rucking score that judges your abilities and warns you away from pushing too hard until you're ready could be extremely useful!</p><p>Garmin says "there is currently no additional tracking regarding judging your ability to adapt to heavier weights," and I can't predict if Garmin has any plans in this area; perhaps rucking is too niche for them to put in that much effort on a new algorithm. For now, I'll focus on my more immediate hope: that more Garmin watches get this cool new rucking activity!</p>

You can now buy any of the three phones included in the flagship series and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25/8666515/"><strong>score $200 off alongside a year of the Unlimited plan</strong></a> for the discounted price of $15 per month. </p><p>In other words, this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-review">Mint Mobile</a> promotion could get you a great 2025 smartphone and a full 12 months of T-Mobile-powered coverage for as little as $780, or $65 per month if you pay using affirm. Considering that most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">best Galaxy S25 deals</a> on the web are trade-in opportunities or gift card incentives, this Mint Mobile offer stands apart as something quite special. Plus, just imagine not paying your phone bill again until March 2026. Yeah, it&apos;s that good. </p>

<p>Purchase the new Samsung Galaxy S25 alongside a year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile and you'll get a straight $200 carved off the phone, plus the price of wireless will drop to only $180 ($15 per month). Both the <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus/8666602/"><strong>Galaxy S25 Plus</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra/8666710/"><strong>S25 Ultra</strong></a> are getting the same deal as the base model S25, so you can choose the version that's right for you. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25/8666515/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="47efc0d1-f5ee-4082-a6be-95c9377c156a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$800" data-dimension48="$800">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want the latest Samsung phone at the best price possible without a trade-in; you&apos;d like to save money on your phone bill in 2025. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to one wireless carrier for a full year; you&apos;re looking for a trade-in opportunity.<strong> </strong></p><p>This deal also comes in the wake of Mint Mobile&apos;s confirmation that it will soon be removing the data cap from its Unlimited plan. Although the Unlimited tier already ranked among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> in the business, the 40GB cap meant that heavy data users couldn&apos;t get the most out of their Mint Mobile service. Thanks to this update, however, the plan will soon get you truly unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network, along with a free mobile hotspot, free calls to Mexico and Canada, and Wi-Fi calling support. </p><p>The phones you&apos;re getting out of the deal are no slouch, either. All three devices in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 lineup</a> are powered by the custom Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get a suite of new Galaxy AI software features, a sophisticated Gorilla Glass Victus 2 construction, and seven years of OS/security updates guaranteed. </p>

<p>Our furry companions are more than just pets; they're family. Don't you find yourself wishing you could call and check on your dog sometimes? Say you're at work or school and wondering whether your puppy is missing you. Enabot created a clever pet tracker with two-way communications embedded into it, turning this dream into reality for all of us.</p><p>The Enabot ROLA PetTracker has other merits as well, including GPS positioning, health tracking, and more. I found the $99 retail price tag very compelling after running tests on this handy pet camera slash tracker.</p><p>Right off the bat, I'll say this, though: while it's advertised for both cats and dogs, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker is simply too big for most kitties.</p>

<p>If you aren't already familiar with the brand, Enabot's specialty is making smart vacuum-inspired pet robots like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/enabot-ebo-x-review">EBO X</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/enabot-rolapet-petpal-hands-on">RolaPet PetPal</a>. Having mastered just the right set of skills needed for tracking and communicating with pets at home, the brand ported those features over to a more compact and mobile form factor with the ROLA PetTracker.</p><p>In essence, the ROLA PetTracker is like any other GPS tracker for your dog. There's a SIM slot for a data SIM, which enables you to track your pet in real-time, and there's a companion app where you can manage all this. But the similarities between commonplace GPS dog trackers and the ROLA PetTracker end there.</p><p>Enabot added mics and a speaker to the ROLA PetTracker so you can talk to your fur baby at any given point of the day. Both the speaker and mic can be enabled or disabled via the Rola app for Android or iOS.</p><p>However, the more impressive feat achieved by this tracker isn't its quadruple positioning system or two-way comms. It's the humble 480p camera and clever additions like a flashlight, an SOS button, and splash-proofing that make this tracker innovative.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this trial, I enlisted the help of five-month-old Rosa, a mid-sized German Shepherd mix who loves to live her best life unapologetically, every single day. This adorable menace served as the perfect test subject for the ROLA PetTracker.</p><p>The purpose of my testing was twofold. Firstly, I wanted to see whether the ROLA PetTracker can actually do the tasks advertised in the wild. And secondly, I aimed to gauge whether it's really worth investing in.</p><p>Enabot includes a harness with one mount each for both cats and dogs in the box. There's also a really small silicone collar included in there, which can't possibly fit any canine's neck without strangling it.</p><p>The idea behind the harness was good, and it was comfy as well, but it was executed poorly. The harness' flawed design lacks buckles to secure the adjusted straps in place, which caused the harness to keep slipping off of poor Rosa during our walk.</p>

<p>During the walk, the Enabot ROLA PetTracker slipped off and fell into puddles quite a few times. Thanks to its splash-proofing, I was able to rinse the camera off and it was good as new later.</p><p>The fickle nature of the harness caused a lot of trouble for both Rosa and me during our excursion. She kept entangling herself between the leash and the harness. It's such a shame because I was really looking forward to capturing her shenanigans from her POV in the harness-mounted videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Te3TWpXCYXuLxCdTP6NPrh" name="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" alt="Enabot ROLA PetTracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Te3TWpXCYXuLxCdTP6NPrh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also used this opportunity outdoors to test the comms system, which worked seamlessly. Initially, Rosa was quite shocked when I used the mic and speaker to talk to her. She got used to it pretty quickly, though, and listened diligently to any commands issued.</p><p>The SOS button functions as it should and in case the battery on the tracker dies, there's a QR code printed on the ROLA PetTracker that can be scanned by others. Although the 480p camera isn't of the best quality and lacks night vision, the flashlight mitigates some of those issues.</p><p>Enabot also incorporated health-tracking metrics into the ROLA PetTracker. Not only can you log your pet's steps and record how much exercise they're getting, but you can also track individual walks using the GPS to see where you walked, when, for how long, and how many steps were taken by your pet in that duration. It's superb, really!</p><p>On top of that, the tracker leverages the camera, GPS, and two-way audio by enabling you to set up a virtual fence for your dog. Any time it ventures beyond your customized radius, you get an alert on your phone, and if you want, so does the dog via sound notification. The virtual fence with sound prompts is an awesomely humane way to train dogs not to stray too far away from home.</p>

<p>Knowing where your dog was when you took it for a walk has several benefits. In the event that you lose your furry friend, drop its toy somewhere, or suspect it ate something funny, being able to retrace its footsteps could save your dog's life!</p><p>All in all, the ROLA PetTracker delivers fantastic value. You get a very good price for something this feature-rich, plus it goes on sale regularly, dropping the price from an amicable $99 to a budget-friendly $79. It's a comprehensive tool that's excellent for pet health management and monitoring health metrics such as your dog's weight, steps, and exercise.</p><p>The water-repellent design can survive a good few splashes but not submersion. Dogs are messy, so I fear it won't do as well against mud and dirtier elements. However, just having splash-proofing is a bonus for a product like this.</p><p>Perhaps the only thing that I'd want to be done better — apart from the harness and tight collar — would be battery longevity. You recharge the Enabot ROLA PetTracker using a USB-C cable and charger, which is incredibly convenient, but the battery doesn't last more than a few days. So, you need to remember to charge it frequently.</p><p>There's really no other pet tracker on the market that's this lightweight and compact, this cheap, and this useful. If you like keeping a close watch on your beloved pups, I highly recommend it.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify plans to launch a new add-on subscription tier dubbed Music Pro, priced at $6 per month in the U.S.</li><li>The tier will likely comprise higher-quality audio (HiFi), remixing tools, access to concert tickets, and the ability to mix songs from different artists.</li><li>The Music Pro tier might also include AI assistance for its users while mixing songs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Spotify will likely bring a budget-friendly add-on tier costing $6 in the U.S. on top of the existing subscription plans, Bloomberg reports.</p><p>The new add-on subscription tier is likely to be dubbed Music Pro, notes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-15/spotify-weighs-6-premium-for-added-features-access-to-tickets">Bloomberg</a> citing sources familiar with the matter. It will also include the much-anticipated higher-quality audio, aka HiFi audio, amongst other notable features. For the unaware, we first heard about the streaming platform bringing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify-hifi-launching-later-year">HiFi audio experience back in 2021</a>, and yet things seem to have not materialized.</p>
<p>The report, however, states that it will happen this year, although the precise timelines are not yet finalized. In addition to the high-quality audio, Music Pro tier users will also have access to remixing tools and concert tickets. For these, the music streaming company seems to have also held “preliminary talks” with relevant promoters and ticket sellers.</p><p>Alongside that, the report notes that Spotify is still working through things like dealing with all major music companies to get the relevant rights. The proposed Music Pro plan will also offer the ability to “mix together songs from different artists.” Additionally, these can include the help of AI too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it sounds like a promising tier update, users will have to shell out around $18 per month, with the addition of the Music Pro tier to the base subscription plan of $12 per month. The prices, however, are believed to vary by geography and cost accordingly, which also applies to the less-developed regions. If and when it happens, the new Music Pro tier will be a phased roll-out globally.</p><p>Overall, given the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-hifi-still-coming">numerous delays</a> over the past few years in achieving higher-quality audio features on Spotify Premium, it is too soon to hold out hope that the aforementioned features will be released this year.</p>

<p>When you weigh the OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2, you'll find there's much more that's changed than just the extra battery life. The design has functional and stylistic changes, the performance has a subtle boost, new sensors give you a wider range of health metrics, and the display has a noticeable boost in several areas.</p><p>That said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> takes after the Watch 3 in predictable ways, and if you're hunting for a deal and considering the last-gen watch, this OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2 guide will help you make your decision!</p><p>Starting with everything that's <em>unchanged</em> between the two, let's dive through the key differences between these two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">excellent Android smartwatches</a>, based on our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">hands-on time with the OnePlus Watch 3</a> and the official specs.</p>

<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-what-s-the-same-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: What's the same?</h2>

<p>These are the key features and design elements that are either unchanged or virtually identical between the OnePlus Watch 3 and Watch 2:</p><p><strong>Processor and memory: </strong>Both watches use the Snapdragon W5 Gen 1, a chip that launched in 2022, with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. They do have different coprocessors, but we'll discuss that later. Essentially, you'll get the same performance speed as other Wear OS watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a>.</p><p><strong>Updates: </strong>Although the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 launched with Wear OS 4 and OS 5, respectively, both watches will receive two version updates and two years of security updates and will share the same features once the Watch 2 updates. This puts OnePlus behind Google (3 OS updates) and Samsung (4 OS updates).</p><p><strong>Straps: </strong>Both watches use 22mm fluororubber straps with stainless steel buckles; unlike other Android watches, the OnePlus Watch 3 and 2 use standard 22mm lugs, so you can use whichever compatible bands you want. We will ask OnePlus whether its fluoroelastomer material has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/does-your-fluoroelastomer-smartwatch-band-have-dangerous-compounds">any issues with toxicity</a> and update if we hear back.</p><p>OnePlus did say it implemented a "new curved strap design that enhances the wraparound fit" for more accurate sensor data, but otherwise, it should feel fairly similar; our tested found that he didn't notice a real difference in comfort.</p><p><strong>Overall size, feel, and colors: </strong>We'll discuss what's changed, design-wise, in the next section, but generally speaking, you're getting a 47mm stainless steel watch that weighs about 80g/2.8 ounces and measures about 13mm thick when you take the sensors into account. OnePlus didn't announce a smaller model for the Watch 2 or 3, which could be a deal-breaker for those with smaller wrists.</p><p>Also, the OnePlus Watch 2 and 3 come in two similar finishes. They have different names — Obsidian Titanium/ Black Steel and Emerald Titanium/ Radiant Steel — but it's essentially the same black and silver options as before.</p><p><strong>Durability:</strong> Both watches have the same dust and water resistance (IP68), though not at the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. OnePlus lists a wide range of military-grade durability tests that the Watch 3 (and 2) passed, including high/low temperature, solar radiation, 96-hour salt spray, vibration, impact, acidic atmosphere, and freezing rain. It's not bulletproof but as rugged as you'd hope for in an Android watch.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-design-and-display-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="V2SQmxfHiJaFRuKtNJ5ZQZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-watch-faces" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) showing two similar watch faces focused on different metrics." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2SQmxfHiJaFRuKtNJ5ZQZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite being the same general size, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new titanium bezel instead of stainless steel, adding a metallic sheen around the edge where the OnePlus Watch 2 had a "sizeable bezel" enveloping the display that annoyed our reviewer.</p><p>Removing that wasted space, OnePlus gave the Watch 3 a 1.5-inch display, a slight visual boost over the 1.43-inch Watch 2. That matches larger Android watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>. We're a little surprised that OnePlus didn't increase the resolution to match the size increase; both watches have 466 x 466 resolution, so the Watch 2's pixels per inch ratio is slightly more dense (~15ppi).</p><p>Still, the OnePlus Watch 3 display has more significant upgrades that make it the clear winner: It hits a peak brightness of 2,200 nits instead of 600 nits and uses an LTPO AMOLED material capable of dipping as low as 1Hz to save battery life.</p><p>Interestingly, our OnePlus Watch 3 tester found there wasn't much visual difference between the two in direct sunlight. He instead appreciated that the Watch 3 uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-dc-dimming-on-the-oneplus-12-and-oneplus-12r">DC dimming</a> at all brightness levels instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM</a>, which can cause headaches for susceptible people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FYXH6JEAXknmUhbbjvRGHZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-crown" alt="A close-up of the OnePlus Watch 2 (left) and OnePlus Watch 3 (right) crowns." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FYXH6JEAXknmUhbbjvRGHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Overall, the OnePlus Watch 3 design looks more like a sports watch thanks to its 60-second scale around the titanium bezel, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a>. The latter did well in our recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a>, and I think it's no surprise that OnePlus realized that this style would make its mainline watches look more distinct.</p><p>OnePlus annoyed some Watch 2 owners by adding a decorative crown with no actual navigational abilities. Hearing that criticism, it converted the OnePlus Watch 3 crown to be functional: you can rotate through menus and press it to select options, so you're no longer fully touch-dependent.</p><p>The crown has a "tapered, pyramid-pattern" texture that's easy to twist. Our tester praised it as the "best crown I've used on any watch to date," noting that it's large enough for your finger to rest comfortably on it, it has a nice tactility, and the haptics feel great when twisted.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-performance-battery-life-and-charging-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: Performance, battery life, and charging</h2>
<p>Even though these watches share a main processor and RAM, the Watch 3 switches to a new coprocessor called the BES2800 for background RTOS tasks. Built on 6nm FinFET tech, it's supposed to have a 200% CPU boost and 400% NPU boost over the 12nm BES2700 in the Watch 2.</p><p>When reviewing last year's Watch 2, our reviewer complained that things didn't work reliably because of the dual-OS solution; we have reason to hope that this upgrade on the Watch 3 will solve some of his problems, like health-tracking inaccuracies and dropped notifications.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JhQDhrgVU9BkqXfpExCMxh" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-official-workout-photo" alt="An athletic man stands with the sun behind him, holding his OnePlus Watch 3 while cueing up an "Outdoor fat burn run" with the screen showing a map." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JhQDhrgVU9BkqXfpExCMxh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of battery life, there's an obvious 131mAh capacity increase, but OnePlus pulled this off while making the Watch 3 slightly skinnier because of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicone-carbon battery tech</a>, which OnePlus calls Silicon NanoStack Battery. It makes your battery denser, meaning you get more capacity and better durability against extreme temperatures while using less space.</p><p>So far, we've found the OnePlus Watch 3 can easily last an estimated five days, including with daily workouts, but our initial hands-on test didn't include sleep tracking. Your personal battery mileage may vary, but generally speaking, <em>both</em> watches are much longer-lived than the average smartwatch; the Watch 3 simply gives you a bit more leeway if you're a power user who frequently makes on-wrist calls, streams music to Bluetooth earbuds, or does a lot of GPS workouts.</p><p>Equally important, both watches support VOOC fast charging that gives you about a day of battery life in 10 minutes. Interestingly, our OnePlus Watch 3 tester found he could charge it from 20% to 100% in just 30 minutes, while the Watch 2 took about an hour to charge fully. OnePlus didn't announce a charging speed increase, but it <em>appears</em> that the Watch 3 charges faster despite its larger capacity.</p>
<h2 id="oneplus-watch-3-vs-watch-2-sensors-and-connectivity-2">OnePlus Watch 3 vs. Watch 2: Sensors and connectivity</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gPjN5NmcaGd9zsuvadw7FZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-sensors-underside" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) sitting upside down without bands, showing the health sensors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gPjN5NmcaGd9zsuvadw7FZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both OnePlus Watches have 8-channel optical heart rate sensors and 16-channel blood oxygen (SpO2) sensors, OnePlus is promising much more accurate results on the Watch 3. We found the Watch 2 wasn't especially accurate for workouts, making this a much-needed improvement.</p><p>Reportedly, the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new back cover glass that improves LED efficiency and a redesigned sensor layout "to reduce the distance between the LED and photodetector" to ensure "signal quality." OnePlus also says it improved its heart rate algorithm.</p><p>This is all on paper, but in our early testing, the OnePlus Watch 3 delivered workout results much closer to that of other smartwatches, whereas the Watch 2 often had curiously deflated results.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mfzazA9HYnxvDGRkTs7aHZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-health-heart-rate" alt="The OnePlus Watch 3 (left) and OnePlus Watch 2 (right) showing comparative heart rate data for the same workout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mfzazA9HYnxvDGRkTs7aHZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from improved accuracy, the OnePlus Watch 3 added an "ECG Analyzer" to judge your heart health; unfortunately, it won't be available in the United States or Canada because OnePlus chose not to try and get FDA certification as a "business decision" to save money.</p><p>OnePlus is adding a 60-second health check-in to the Watch 3 starting in March 2025 that'll analyze your vascular age, heart rate, SpO2, mental wellness, sleep quality, wrist temperature, and (in Europe and Asia) ECG data. Your vascular health, or arterial stiffness risk, will be a new major focus with its own app and tile, aiming to catch hypertension issues.</p><p>In addition, OnePlus is offering new sleep data insights in the OHealth app — though we suspect some of them will come to the Watch 2, as well. Essentially, you'll be able to check your sleep score/duration, respiratory rate, HRV, body movement, snoring levels, and your resting heart rate compared to your typical baseline.</p><p>But the big new addition is skin temperature. You must wear the watch for at least four hours of sleep tracking per night for five days; after that, OnePlus will have a temperature baseline to compare against, warning you if your health check or overnight temperature appears elevated.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DFAqZxj8nxLgWwNayHdYBi" name="OnePlus-Watch-3-official-sleep-tracking-photo" alt="A sleeping woman laying in bed in a dark room wearing a OnePlus Watch 3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DFAqZxj8nxLgWwNayHdYBi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the connectivity front, OnePlus upgraded the Bluetooth chip from 5.0 to 5.2 for the Watch 3, but the Wi-Fi standard is unchanged. You get NFC for Google Wallet payments, but it appears that OnePlus once again won't offer an LTE upgrade option or ultra-wideband support.</p><p>One subtle upgrade is to GPS tracking. The OnePlus Watch 2 had dual-band GPS, but the OnePlus Watch 3 has a new "circular-polarized antenna" that's designed to capture weak signals more reliably and "reduce refraction caused by tall buildings." Plus, it added a new 7nm GPS chip that reportedly reduces power consumption by "over 50%" while speeding up your satellite search.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ" name="oneplus-watch-3-vs-oneplus-watch-2-watch-faces-02" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 (left) and OnePlus Watch 3 (right) held in two hands, showing their default watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xepaVEm9ETy59vWZ5zpyFZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus kept the same rugged, classic design philosophy for the Watch 3 and 2, and Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">next Snapdragon chip</a> likely won't be available until later this year, so OnePlus had no upgrade option. But otherwise, this guide should clarify just how many generational changes OnePlus made with the Watch 3! Almost nothing was left unchanged.</p><p>If you bought the OnePlus Watch 2, I can't tell you whether it's too soon to upgrade or not, but OnePlus certainly made the Watch 3 tempting.</p><p>The upgrades to the background MCU and health sensors, along with subtle OHealth changes, make it more reliable as a fitness watch. The battery life and charging boosts are significant, but the Watch 2 is no slouch in either area. You'll really appreciate the brighter, smoother display, but you may not appreciate the lack of a 1.2- or 1.3-inch option.</p><p>Until our OnePlus Watch 3 review lets us test the battery, software, and health data more thoroughly, we can't give a full-throated recommendation. But based on our initial impressions, this is a much stronger Android smartwatch than the Watch 2, and I'd recommend paying extra for the Watch 3 instead of grabbing the Watch 2 on sale.</p>

Although to be fair, this is true for most phones as companies stuff more features into them each year. On Samsung devices, in particular, there are a lot of hidden features, duplicate apps/services, and various settings that you may not be aware of.</p><p>So, while we have plenty of tips and tricks for individual <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a>, these are the settings that can be applied on most Samsung phones and aren't device-specific (with some exceptions for flagship features). These are also suggestions on features you can change and apps to download, but obviously, it's up to you whether or not to follow some or all of these tips.</p><p>So, now that you've moved over all your data to a new Samsung device, here are some things you should do to get the most out of your phone.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-change-power-button-to-power-menu"><span>Change power button to power menu</span></h2>
<p>For some reason, companies have gotten into the habit of defaulting the power button to enable digital assistants like Bixby or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>. When set up this way, powering your phone off will require you to press both the power and volume up button, just adding an extra layer to what should be a simple function.</p><p>While quick access to your digital assistant is nice and all, there are other ways to evoke the assistants, and if you're like us, you want the power button to act like a power button.</p><p>Fortunately, changing this is pretty easy, even if it's still annoying that you have to. In order to get your power button back, navigate to <strong>Settings > Advanced features > Side button</strong>. In the <strong>Long Press</strong> section, make sure it's set to <strong>Power off menu</strong>, unless you really want to use it to wake Bixby or Gemini.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="9KcoSGFJsYTtshZM6yjedH" name="Samsung-one-ui-side-button" alt="Side button options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9KcoSGFJsYTtshZM6yjedH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also use this menu to enable the Double press option for the power button, which can either open the camera or open an app of your choosing.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-choose-between-bixby-or-google-assistant-gemini"><span>Choose between Bixby or Google (Assistant/Gemini)</span></h2>
<p>It's always important to check and change your default apps and services to fit your needs. The AI assistant is among those, and while the newer Samsung phones come with Gemini as the default, older models often default to Bixby, which isn't everyone's cup of tea. Regardless of what your preference is, changing the default is pretty simple.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Apps > Default apps</strong>, then tap <strong>Digital assistant app</strong>. This will set the AI assistant that will wake up whenever you use the Side button (if you have that enabled). There are also other digital assistant options you can enable here, such as the ability to analyze on-screen text and on-screen images and the option to flash the screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="mu5nLuEiuLj9Xi6sjWzBmH" name="Samsung-one-ui-default-digital-assistant" alt="Default digital assistant on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mu5nLuEiuLj9Xi6sjWzBmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-gesture-nagivation"><span>Set up gesture nagivation</span></h2>
<p>Since around 2017, gesture navigation has become a bit of a norm for phones, replacing the three-button navigation for an arguably more intuitive way to navigate your phone. That said, there are many phones that will still default to the three-button navigation of the olden days, but changing that is pretty easy.</p><p>You can set this during the setup process, but in case you decide you want to switch the navigation type, you can navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Navigation bar</strong>, and select the option for <strong>Swipe gestures</strong>. You can also select <strong>More options</strong> to adjust the Gesture sensitivity, which will help improve gestures when you have a case on your phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="mjPDYUWbJkHrvj3zzySvmH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Gesture-navigation" alt="Gesture navigation options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjPDYUWbJkHrvj3zzySvmH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-update-galaxy-apps"><span>Update Galaxy apps</span></h2>
<p>You should always be sure to update your apps in the Play Store to ensure you're using the most up-to-date versions. However, not all of your apps come from the Play Store. Samsung phones also manage some apps with the company's own app store, aka the Galaxy Store.</p><p>It's important to update these apps as they'll provide improved functionality to built-in Samsung apps and features.</p><p>Head to the Galaxy Store, tap the <strong>Menu</strong> tab, then tap <strong>Updates</strong>. If there are updates present, they'll be listed here.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="WUvEos5cjLaqLM8ue3W5QJ" name="Samsung-one-ui-Galaxy-Store-app-updates" alt="Updating Galaxy Store apps on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WUvEos5cjLaqLM8ue3W5QJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-good-lock"><span>Download Good Lock</span></h2>
<p>Android is often praised for its ability to be customized by users, but different OEMs offer various levels of customization options out of the box. Samsung gives users plenty of options, but what you might not know is that Samsung has a way to offer even deeper levels of customization.</p><p>Enter <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a>. It's an app that offers various modules a user can download to change different aspects of the UI, from the notification bar to the Settings Menu layout and much more. You can get pretty creative with Good Lock, which makes it a staple on any Samsung phone.</p><p>You can download Good Lock from the Galaxy Store or Play Store, after which you will have to download individual modules. From there, you can play around with different settings so your phone looks and behaves exactly how you want it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-Good-Lock.jpg" alt="Good Lock on the Galaxy Z Flip 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jR2Gcb2Wo8XSNoioVVm5pD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-to-a-vertical-scrolling-app-drawer"><span>Switch to a vertical scrolling app drawer</span></h2>
<p>For years, Samsung phones defaulted to a horizontal paginated app drawer, which many people don't like. Fortunately, the company lets you switch to a vertical app drawer similar to what's found on just about every other Android phone.</p><p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, it's pretty easy to enable. You'll just head to your app drawer and tap the <strong>three dots </strong>in the Search bar. Tap <strong>Sort</strong> and then choose <strong>Alphabetical order</strong>. Now, the app drawer will switch to vertical scrolling with a bar on the side to easily jump to a certain letter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="fqdp9QiS3sP3nkfHDXfLjJ" name="Samsung-one-ui-7-vertical-app-drawer" alt="Enable vertical app drawer on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fqdp9QiS3sP3nkfHDXfLjJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-download-camera-assistant"><span>Download Camera Assistant</span></h2>
<p>Like Good Lock, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-customize-samsung-galaxy-camera-settings-good-lock">Camera Assistant app</a> is another app we wish Samsung included by default on its phones. Camera Assistant adds more settings to your stock camera app, which can change the UI, adjust how fast the phone captures images, or even change how the app processes images. It's pretty handy if you want to improve your camera experience.</p><p>Download the Camera Assistant app from the Galaxy Store. Then, open the <strong>Camera app</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Camera Settings</strong>. Scroll to <strong>Camera Assistant</strong>, and from there, go through the list of options and adjust the camera with the settings you think will work best for your needs. For instance, having quick access to a 2x button is quite helpful for many, while the option to fix image distortion can enhance photos taken with the ultrawide camera.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.00%;"><img id="iERzcEkTuLrDSAVVPHajiH" name="Samsung-Camera-Assistant-app" alt="Camera Assistant app on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iERzcEkTuLrDSAVVPHajiH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3164" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-set-up-modes-and-routines"><span>Set up Modes and Routines</span></h2>
<p>Smartphones are pretty smart, but sometimes they need a little help to know what you want. That's where modes and routines come in. With this feature on your Samsung phone, you can set up various modes to help minimize distractions from your phone based on your activity, whether its sleeping, working out, or if you're at the movie theater. You can also set up easy automations for your phone to perform based on a location or activity.</p><p>To set this up, navigate to <strong>Settings > Modes and Routines</strong>. Here, you'll find two tabs where you can set up new or create modes and routines. There are already preset modes that you can edit, which should cover many of the basics, but you're also free to add a new one. Routines will have to be set up from scratch, but they're pretty easy to put together; it's just a simple if/then formula with options already available to you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.73%;"><img id="j7MxFyM2o3npCCgrHYVsVH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Modes" alt="Modes and routines on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7MxFyM2o3npCCgrHYVsVH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3030" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Routines come especially handy if you have smart home devices like smart light bulbs and want them to automatically turn on when you arrive at your home. You can set up useful routines such as this or even ones that will adjust settings on your phone based on certain actions or times of the day.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-galaxy-ai-features"><span>Enable Galaxy AI features</span></h2>
<p>AI is everywhere, and while Google has a ton of fun features you can access via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>, Samsung also has its suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features to take advantage of for osme of its higher-end smartphones. Fortunately, you can find all these new features in one place and enable or disable them easily.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Galaxy AI</strong>, and you'll see a list of features available on your device. As of One UI 7, these are the features you'll find on your eligible Samsung phone:</p>
<ul><li>Call assist</li><li>Writing assist</li><li>Interpreter</li><li>Note assist</li><li>Transcript assist</li><li>Browsing assist</li><li>Photo assist</li><li>Drawing assist</li><li>Audio eraser (Galaxy S25)</li><li>Photo ambient wallpaper</li><li>Now brief</li><li>Health assist</li></ul>
<p>Dive into each of these options to toggle or change settings, such as voices, summarizations, and even languages. You can also download languages directly from some of these options so that your phone can translate on-device. Furthermore, you can opt to process AI features on-device for additional privacy.</p><p>Some features, such as Photo assist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-samsung-galaxy-s25">Drawing assist</a>, Photo ambient wallpaper, and Health assist, will be found in apps such as the Gallery app, Notes, the Edge panel, and Wallpaper and style.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="dHxquB8h7uvAdmHDJnpUzH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-AI" alt="Galaxy AI options on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dHxquB8h7uvAdmHDJnpUzH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, not every Samsung device has access to Galaxy AI. The features are mostly exclusive to flagship phones and will vary depending on the device based on its hardware capabilities, including the Galaxy S series (S22 to S25), Z series (Flip/Fold 4 to Flip/Fold 6), the Tab S8 to S10 series, and older models (S21 series, Z Flip/Fold 3).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-use-the-edge-panel-for-quick-access-to-apps"><span>Use the Edge panel for quick access to apps </span></h2>
<p>One of our favorite Samsung features is the Edge panel. This hides away a selection of apps and other tools that you can easily access with a swipe from either side of the display. It sort of acts similar to a taskbar you'll find on foldable phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, but it's a bit more functional as it doesn't just access applications.</p><p>To turn it on, navigate to <strong>Settings > Display > Edge panels</strong>, and toggle the feature on. Tapping on the option will take you to a separate menu for Edge panels, where you can select which panels you want active and customize the handle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4520px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:67.52%;"><img id="At7Rx58U3g3FcBnPJhtcjH" name="Samsung-one-ui-Edge-panels" alt="Edge panels on a Samsung phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/At7Rx58U3g3FcBnPJhtcjH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4520" height="3052" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Available panels include:</p>
<ul><li>Apps</li><li>People</li><li>Tasks</li><li>Weather</li><li>Tools</li><li>Music</li><li>Reminder</li><li>Clipboard</li></ul>
<p>Keep in mind that you have a limit of 22 apps you can add to the Apps panel, so your best bet is to choose the ones you'll likely want to access most.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-google-wallet-and-disable-samsung-wallet"><span>Enable Google Wallet and disable Samsung Wallet</span></h2>
<p>It seems like Samsung and Google are often fighting for your attention on these devices, as you can often find duplicate apps from both companies that do essentially the same thing. That's where Samsung Wallet and Google Wallet come in. Samsung Wallet is fine but has fallen from grace over the years following major changes and the deprecation of features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> has seemingly thrived since its rebirth, with more and more banks supporting it and Google making it easy to add things like transit tickets, passes, and now even digital IDs. There's little reason not to use Google Wallet, as it's slowly becoming an all-in-one digital wallet.</p><p>To enable it, make sure you download Google Wallet if it's not already installed on your phone.

<p>You'll also want to disable Quick access so you don't keep pulling up Samsung Wallet whenever you swipe up from the bottom of the display. To do this, enter the <strong>Quick access tab</strong> in Samsung Wallet, tap <strong>Settings</strong>, and tap <strong>Quick Access</strong>. The first option you'll see is <strong>Swipe up gesture</strong>, which will allow you to toggle off the Lock screen, Home screen, and Screen off.</p><p>Alternatively, you can always uninstall the Samsung Wallet app if you decide you just don't want to deal with it at all.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-switch-out-samsung-keyboard-for-gboard"><span>Switch out Samsung Keyboard for Gboard</span></h2>
<p>We know Samsung Keyboard's uses, and they are few. The default keyboard experience on a Samsung phone isn't that great, although there are some useful features, such as the Interpreter mode, which translates text conversations for you. But I digress.</p><p>You're better off switching to Gboard, as it's much better at... well, everything. Plus, you get access to Emoji Kitchen, which lets you create fun emoji mashups. And on One UI 7, Samsung even made it so you can still use some Galaxy AI features without having Samsung Keyboard enabled, which is a huge win.</p><p>First, you'll want to download Gboard, which you can do from the Play Store. Then, navigate to <strong>Settings > General management > Keyboard list and default</strong>. Toggle Gboard on, then tap the option to personalize the keyboard's theme and behaviors. Then, in the keyboard menu, tap <strong>Default keyboard</strong> and select <strong>Gboard</strong>.</p><p>You're welcome.</p>

<p>It's always annoying to have to remember all your passwords and login information. That's where autofill comes in, which attempts to save that information across devices when you sign into the same account where the information is saved. There are various password options that you can use to save your passwords, but you'll want to make sure you enable the right one when you set up your Samsung device to make it easier to log into all your apps.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Security and privacy > More security settings > Passwords, passkeys, and autofill</strong>. Tap the <strong>Preferred service</strong> section to view the available services you can enable as a default for autofill. If you don't see yours, you can always tap <strong>Add service</strong>, which will send you straight to Google Play to download a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-password-managers-android">password manager</a>.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-notification-categories"><span>Enable Notification categories</span></h2>
<p>One UI has come a long way, and we were impressed with One UI 6 and more so with One UI 7. However, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/enable-notification-categories-samsung-galaxy-s24">changed how notifications are handled</a>, which some may find annoying and/or limiting. Notification categories gives you more granular control over notifications, which is quite useful, but it's disabled by default on Samsung's more recent software versions. Here's how you can turn it back on.</p><p>Navigate to <strong>Settings > Notifications > Advanced settings</strong>. Scroll down and enable the option to <strong>Manage notification categories</strong> for each app. Now, you can choose how specific apps notify you during certain events instead of a one-size-fits-all situation.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-make-sure-you-re-backing-up-your-data"><span>Make sure you're backing up your data</span></h2>
<p>This should come as a no-brainer, but you'd be surprised how many people still don't back up their phones. It's important because it lets you keep all your data when moving from one device to another in case you lose or break one device. That way, even if the old device isn't accessible, your data will still be safe.</p><p>Get started with backing up your data by navigating to <strong>Settings > Accounts and backup</strong> and then choosing between Samsung Cloud and Google Drive.</p><p>With Samsung Cloud, tap <strong>Back up data</strong> and toggle on the data you want to be backed up to your Samsung account. With Google Drive, the phone will utilize <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> to back up and manage your data. It's a bit less granular than Samsung Cloud, but you should still back up to Google One even if you backed up to Samsung Cloud; that way, you have your data in more than one place.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now that you've followed these steps, you should have a better idea of the ways you can customize your Samsung phone just the way you like. Of course, all of these are optional, so you can always change things up depending on your preferences, but now you at least know where to find settings for some of One UI's most useful features.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Foldables have gotten much better in the last two years, and I enjoyed using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and Pixel 9 Pro Fold in recent months. While each iteration brings thinner designs, better cameras, and bigger batteries, the underlying foundation is broadly unchanged. <br><br>That's what makes the Huawei Mate XT such a unique device. The tri-fold nature of the foldable means you can use it as three different devices — a regular phone, fold-out device, and a full-fledged tablet once it's extended all the way. The design is distinctly unique, and while other brands are set to launch their own take on Huawei's idea sometime later this year, there isn't another device like the Mate XT right now. <br><br>The foldable debuted in China at the end of last year, and Huawei is thankfully introducing it in global markets. The brand showcased the tri-fold device at a media event in Malaysia, debuting it alongside the new 13-inch MatePad Pro and FreeArc buds. Given the innovative design and the fact that you essentially get three panels joined together, it was always going to be the case that the Mate XT would cost more than the likes of the Honor Magic V3, and now we know by how much — the device is going on sale for €3,499 ($3,600) this month.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="po23yidmsGaytckwrU6RLH" name="Huawei Mate XT" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/po23yidmsGaytckwrU6RLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It is available in a 16GB/1TB configuration globally, and Huawei has no plans to bring the 256GB or 512GB models outside China. The panel goes all the way up to 10.2 inches when fully extended, and the OLED inner panel has good brightness and color saturation. <br><br>It has interesting cameras as well, with Huawei using the same 50MP main lens as the Pura 70 devices. That's joined by a 12MP telephoto with 5.5x optical zoom, and a 12MP wide-angle lens. There's a 5600mAh silicon-carbon battery, and you get 66W charging as standard. Oh, and did I mention that it's the thinnest foldable available today? It comes in at an unbelievable 3.6mm when fully unfolded, and even the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-find-n5-could-be-even-thinner-than-the-magic-v3-and-thats-a-big-deal">Find N5</a> doesn't measure up to that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="zGzEyhsHcoQHqrMyoJvVPH" name="Huawei Mate XT" alt="Huawei Mate XT Ultimate Design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zGzEyhsHcoQHqrMyoJvVPH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the underlying Kirin 9010 isn't anywhere as fast as the Dimensity 9400, it does a great job in its own right, and I didn't see any issues in the little while I've used the device. That said, I'm just getting started with my unit, and I'll only know more once I start using it in earnest. <br><br>But even just setting up the Mate XT, I'm excited about its potential. The ultra-sleek design along with the tablet-sized panel, massive battery, and custom camera tech combine to make a foldable that doesn't really have an equal, and I can't wait to see how it holds up in real-world use — but more on that next week.</p>

<p><em><strong>T.J. asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I'm taking a vacation to Turkey, Greece, and Italy for a few weeks and this is the first time I'll be travelling without my work phone. Will my Galaxy S23 work without costing me an arm and a leg in international roaming fees from AT&T? Is there anything i should do before I leave to make sure?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Hi T.J.! I'm jealous that you'll be catching the Mediterranean sun while I'm fighting the snow and slop here on the East Coast. You couldn't have picked a better place to spend a few weeks and I'll bet you have a great time.</p><p>For a quick answer to your question — you might be able to pop a local <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-prepaid-sim-cards-us-travelers-and-tourists">pre-paid SIM card</a> in your phone and bypass those uber-expensive international roaming fees at the cost of not having your normal phone number for a few weeks. It all depends on if your phone is region-locked.</p>
<p>Unless you specifically bought an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-unlocked-phone">unlocked phone</a> (something you should always do when you can) from your carrier (there are ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-do-i-know-whether-my-phone-unlocked">check if your phone is unlocked</a>) it's likely to have several of the radio bands locked in the firmware. They are still there and capable of working, they just need the lock removed.</p><p>Your carrier can do this in a store with technicians and the correct software, but getting them to do so can be difficult; they would rather you pay roaming fees or buy an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/att-launches-new-passport-international-roaming-plans">international plan</a> add-on.</p>

<p>That's actually not a bad idea in this case. If your phone is region-locked to North America spending an extra $10 or so per day is the easy way to use your phone almost anywhere without huge roaming fees. It's certainly less intimidating than unlocking the radio bands yourself through the phone's service menu.</p><p>If you're like me though, you'd rather mess with things than give AT&T extra money. The good news is that this has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xdaforums.com/t/how-to-enable-all-bands-through-service-menu-on-us-ca-s23-series-including-sub-6-and-mmwave.4554611/" target="_blank">all been figured out</a> and you can find complete instructions to do it yourself. Once this is done, you can pop a local SIM in and go. You might not have the fastest network connection, but everything will work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3724px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-s23-s22-cameras.jpg" alt="Galaxy S23 and Galaxy S22 cameras side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pJ4zjoy544m6cYA3ELFpvQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3724" height="2094" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What you'll be doing is entering a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-secret-android-settings">secret code</a>" into the phone's dialer to reach a technical menu that allows you to lock and unlock radio frequencies. It's not difficult, but it can be intimidating. That's why I mentioned how much easier adding a daily international add-on to your plan is. You can either pay $100 or so per week or go through a tedious and intricate set of instructions.</p><p>There is a third option — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>. If your phone is carrier-unlocked (a different type of lock than region-lock; phone makers and carriers love locking things, apparently), you can buy a month of Google Fi service, which works with no extra fees in all three countries you mentioned. You don't have to sign any sort of contract, and when you're done, you just don't renew it.</p><p>You'll have a different number, just like you would if you used a local SIM card, but you won't be paying a bunch of surprise fees or a daily fee to use your phone without roaming charges.</p>
<p>Other than making sure you've enabled some sort of network connection, there isn't anything else to do. Your phone will automatically adjust things like the time and get its new location without doing anything and it should work exactly the same way it does back home.</p><p>Now, have fun in the sun for all of us stuck here in the winter weather!</p>

<hr>
<p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-oppo-find-n5-and-oneplus-open-2-should-have-samsung-and-google-worried">OPPO Find N5 launch just around the corner</a>, the company's head honcho shared a sneak peek at a new handy feature: remote Mac control.</p><p>Pete Lau, OPPO’s chief product officer, teased a standout software feature for their upcoming foldable. In a post on X, he revealed that the Find N5 will let users remotely control their Mac, making it easy to view and edit files on the go.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tech should make life easy and seamless. That’s why we’ve developed a system for the #OPPOFindN5 to remotely control your Mac—enabling real-time file viewing and editing, enhancing your productivity, and ensuring smoother interaction between devices.More details coming at our… pic.twitter.com/qO5mNHWIXD<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1891376292827938871">February 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>This feature isn’t exactly a surprise. OPPO’s ColorOS design director, Chen Xi, had already hinted at it by sharing a Weibo post showing a macOS desktop mirrored on a partially folded Find N5. In the image, the top half of the device displayed the macOS screen, while the bottom half functioned as a keyboard.</p><p>Lau’s latest teaser featured an image of the Find N5 hooked up to a MacBook. The phone’s screen showed a “Remote PC Control” menu, with a connected Mac seemingly tied to the same account as the Find N5.</p><p>The Find N5’s remote control menu suggests it can handle multiple connected devices. At the same time, the Mac’s screen confirms the link, allowing file access from the Find N5. Pete Lau is set to reveal more details about this feature at a February 20 event, where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">the Find N5 is scheduled to debut</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="5ta7aTwD7nkp2qGZ6zgdTV" name="Oppo-Find-N5-Mac-remote-control" alt="A feature for the OPPO Find N5 to remotely control your Mac" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5ta7aTwD7nkp2qGZ6zgdTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="720" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pete Lau / X)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This feature goes beyond just mirroring a Mac’s screen on the Find N5—it also lets users control the computer remotely.</p><p>From what Xi revealed earlier, this feature seems to build on the "O+ interconnection" tech (machine translated). That probably ties into O+ Connect, an app already out there for iOS that lets OPPO and OnePlus phones swap files at speeds rivaling AirDrop.</p><p>While the Find N5 is bringing some fresh ideas to the table, it’s not the first Android device to pull off remote macOS control. Vivo’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">high-end Android phones</a>, including its foldables, have been doing this in China for a while thanks to the OriginOS skin. So, OPPO’s stepping into some already-tested territory.</p><p>Since Lau has been hyping this feature to a global crowd, it’s a safe bet that OPPO will roll it out in international versions of the Find N5. And why not? It’s shaping up to be a killer productivity tool for all kinds of scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you need a portable storage solution that you can easily throw into your pocket or handbag. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you need more than 2TB of storage; you&apos;re looking for a comprehensive storage solution for your home office or media library (one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-home">best NAS servers for home</a> might be a better choice, if so). </p><p>Whether you&apos;re a student, filmmaker, or avid gamer, the Samsung T7 is an awesome choice if you regularly need storage while you&apos;re out and about. The hard drive can be easily slipped into a pocket or thrown into a backpack, and thanks to the sturdy, shock-resistant construction (tested for drops of up to six feet), you won&apos;t need to worry about losing your precious files if the SSD takes a little spill. </p><p>This version of the Samsung T7 comes with 2TB of storage, plus you get write speeds of up to 1,050MB/s and the ability to record video in 4K Ultra HD directly to the hard drive.

<ul><li>The alleged "mini" OnePlus 13 is rumored to feature a flagship-level battery at 6,000mAh or higher.</li><li>The Weibo tipster states the device should remain fairly thin despite such a large battery.</li><li>Previous rumors claim the phone will see a redesigned camera "bar" with two lenses and a 6.3-inch OLED display.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Additional rumors have surfaced regarding the supposed battery plans for an alleged upcoming OnePlus device.</p><p>A post by Weibo leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PeHs9q14l">Digital Chat Station</a> (DCS) claims OnePlus will look to provide its recent flagship-level battery within the rumored "OnePlus 13 Mini" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/17/oneplus-13-mini-battery-report/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster suggests this rumored device will be the first "small screen" to reach a 6,000mAh capacity battery.</p><p>It seems that this was a follow-up post <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5133964711298245">to another claim</a>, that stated this 6.3-inch screen phone will receive a "6,000mAh plus" battery" in the "first half" of 2025. The publication notes an interaction between DCS and a user's comment about the phone's thickness (since it's all the rage).</p><p>The user questioned if the device would be roughly 9mm in thickness to accommodate such a large battery. Simply put: the tipster says "no."</p>

<p>OnePlus has put more effort into creating larger batteries that don't take much space, i.e., <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">its new Glacier technology</a>. The Chinese OEM discussed this new tech last summer, stating it leverages a "silicon carbon anode" to produce batteries with 6,000mAh or even 6,100mAh capacities. These new batteries support the company's 100W fast charging with the promise of holding at 80% battery health after four years.</p><p>This tech was packed into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-ace-3-pro-announced-in-china">OnePlus Ace 3 Pro</a> and the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> model.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that while OnePlus is taking strides to further improve its batteries, Samsung is (just now) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-future-galaxy-s-phones-battery-charging-rumors">trying to catch up</a>. The company is reportedly looking into silicon-carbon batteries for its next wave of Galaxy S phones, which have become notably stagnant regarding their battery and (the same old) 45W charging speed.</p><p>Elsewhere, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-mini-camera-bar-dual-specs-rumored">rumors of a "mini"</a> OnePlus 13 claim it will feature a dual-camera array, consisting of a 50MP primary lens and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x zoom. Speculation states the device may switch up its camera design by packing these lenses in a "bar" instead of the familiar circular housing. Rumors add the device could be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite with a flat 6.3-inch OLED display.</p><p>Its launch window is still in limbo as some rumors claim the "first half" of 2025 while others purport the second half.</p>

<ul><li>Users have taken to X and the Samsung forums to report charging issues with the Galaxy S25 Plus and Galaxy S25 Ultra.</li><li>The issues stem from the 45W adapter and 5A cable as users state their devices are either charging slow or not charging at all.</li><li>A Samsung Italia rep confirmed the issue, stating the company is aware and will rectify via a patch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Owners of Samsung's recent Galaxy devices are reporting some strange charging issues.</p><p>Reports cropped up a week ago as users on Samsung's European <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s25-series/s25-charging-problems/td-p/11648030">community forums</a> cited problems with the Galaxy S25 Plus and the S25 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-charging-slow/">SamMobile</a>). The original poster of this forum thread states that their Plus model is encountering issues when charging via Samsung's 45W charger and 5A cable. The user says the products "no longer work" when plugged in for a charging cycle.</p><p>Moreover, the user's Galaxy S25 Plus says it's charging rapidly using Samsung's "Super Charge 2.0" capabilities, but that's not the case. The user adds their device's display frequently displays "the charging status - even though the cable is not moved."</p><p>The user found relief by turning off the fast charging function; however, without it, their Plus charges quite slowly.</p><p>Other users chimed in, with one stating their Galaxy S25 Ultra has the same problem: caught in an endless loop of "charging, not charging... over and over." For this particular case, the user's spouse had no issues with their Ultra and they were forced to receive a new Galaxy S25 Ultra from Verizon — which worked fine.</p><p>Another user stated they purchased a 45W charger for their Ultra and, after two charging cycles, they encountered issues.</p><p>The publication spotted Italian users conversing with Samsung Italia and it seems the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SamsungItalia/status/1887886563733864517">is aware of the problem</a>. The community rep states, "We are aware of an anomaly on charging with the 5A cable that will be resolved with a future update."</p><p>So, it appears that the 45W charger's 5A cable is the culprit, causing some strange disconnect between the phone and the Super Fast Charging function. The X post didn't state <em>when </em>users could see this software fix rollout. While it doesn't seem that widespread, it's still an annoying issue to grapple with.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Samsung pushed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/first-galaxy-s25-series-february-2025-security-patch">its first patch</a> to the Galaxy S25 series late last week. The update was pretty light, only offering a few system-wide improvements and other subtle fixes to improve its stability. Samsung did roll in a trove of security fixes for dozens of flaws and vulnerabilities within its system. This recent patch didn't mention anything about charging issues affecting Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra users, meaning we might have to wait a little longer.</p><p>It remains to be seen if Samsung pushes an emergency patch for this. A more likely case waiting until the March 2025 security patch.</p><p>These issues also create a discouraging overcast as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/major-galaxy-s25-ultra-battery-charging-test-highlighted">a recent test</a> showed that Samsung improved its battery and charging capabilities. The company improved its overall charging speeds, quickening its 0% to 70% charging cycle to 30 minutes and shaving off its 0% to 100% time. Unfortunately, with these issues plaguing several Plus and Ultra models, users are left with more frustrations than enjoyment.</p><p>This isn't the only issue affecting Galaxy S25 Ultra users as a recent report claims the phone's magnetic accessories are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultras-s-pen-gets-wonky-with-magnetic-accessories-on">negatively impacting</a> its S Pen functions.</p>

<ul><li>Paramount channels will be available on YouTube TV for the foreseeable future as the two sides reached an agreement.</li><li>The deal comes after the two sides publicly struggled to find what YouTube TV described as "a fair deal."</li><li>The negotiations came shortly after YouTube TV raised prices by $10 per month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Paramount channels were briefly in jeopardy of becoming unavailable on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, but the two sides were able to reach an agreement to keep Paramount's 34 channels on the live TV streaming service. YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> the deal on Feb. 15, following a days-long ordeal that saw Paramount run "Keep Paramount" ads on social media and YouTube TV criticize the company for not offering "a fair deal."</p><p>"We’re happy to share that we’ve reached a deal to continue carrying Paramount channels, including CBS, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon and more," wrote YouTube TV in the blog post. "To our subscribers, we appreciate your patience while we negotiated on your behalf."</p><p>YouTube TV says the agreement will keep over 100 channels available on the live TV service. It'll also provide Paramount add-ons, like Paramount Plus with SHOWTIME. Paramount offers over 30 channels on YouTube TV, including heavy-hitters like CBS and CBS Sports. High-profile sporting events — including March Madness (the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) and The Masters — are set to air on the networks in the coming months.</p><p>That, paired with YouTube TV's $10 price hike last month, set the service up for a potential disaster if it couldn't reach a deal.</p><p>Things started out dire on Feb. 12, when YouTube TV warned customers that Paramount channels could disappear from the service as early as the end of the following day. It followed up with an update Feb. 13 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-reaches-temporary-deal-to-keep-paramount-channels-including-cbs">YouTube TV reached "a short-term extension" with Paramount</a> while the negotiations continued. In the event it couldn't reach a long-term deal, YouTube TV threw out the idea of offering customers a credit that would allow them to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/paramount-plus">Paramount Plus</a>.</p><p>In the end, that wasn't necessary, because the two sides have figured out an agreement. It's not the first time YouTube TV has had issues keeping channels available. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-major-free-channels-outage-issues-confirmed">YouTube TV fixed a problem affecting free channels</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram's head, Adam Mosseri teased a dislike button for comments on the platform as users started noticing it appears during its limited test.</li><li>Mosseri states the dislike button is quite basic for now, but there are plans to add its "signals" to the platform to help push frequently disliked comments out of sight.</li><li>A study from 2022 showed that YouTube's dislike button wasn't entirely effective in preventing unwanted content from showing up.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram is reportedly working on a feature that its users may recognize from the old days of YouTube.</p><p>The Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.net/@mosseri/post/DGD12NZPjwb">posted an explainer</a> about the chance for a "dislike button" to arrive on the platform (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/instagram-starts-testing-dislike-button-comments/">91Mobiles</a>). It seems that Instagram has been running a limited test as Mosseri states some users have already noticed a dislike button beside comments in a post. The post explains that Instagram won't leave much user-facing information by way of a dislike count or notification to others that you've "thumbs downed."</p><p>Instead, Mosseri teases that Instagram's dislike function will be more personal, designed to give "people a private way to signal that they don’t feel good about that particular comment."</p><p>The post teases what <em>could be </em>in store for the future of Instagram's dislike button, like the platform taking into account what you don't like. In short, Mosseri states the platform may "integrate this signal into comments," so things that people have consistently down voted will be pushed toward the bottom.</p><p>Right now, it just appears that Mosseri is bringing awareness to this test as a few users have begun noticing it. Considering the function is pretty barebones (it lacks the signals teased, we might have some waiting to do before it rolls out officially.</p>

<p>There are a couple of platforms that come to mind regarding dislikes: Reddit and YouTube. While the former still has an upvote and downvote feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-dislike-and-not-interested-buttons-are-useless">the latter removed it long ago</a>. There was also a study in 2022 that brought attention to YouTube's dislike button and how it (really) didn't help you much. According to Mozilla's research, the dislike option of YouTube could not properly guide bad recommendations out of a user's sight.</p><p>Out of 500 million analyzed videos, the dislike button only succeeded in preventing roughly 12% of unwanted content from appearing.</p><p>What was far more effective was the "remove from watch history" and don't recommend channel" options.</p><p>Additionally, Instagram's interest in hiding away negative or hurtful comments is an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-updates-blocking-nudges-hidden-words">its updated safety features</a>. The platform lets users block one person's account, as well as any other accounts that person may have. That update also brought improvements to Hidden Words, which let users turn on a filter that automatically removed harmful content from their comments and DMs.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amazon has started suggesting that it is removing the ability to download and back up Kindle books to its PCs.</p><p>The feature widely dubbed “Download & Transfer via USB” will be removed starting February 26 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/amazon-closing-kindle-loophole-remove-drm/">Android Police</a>). Amazon has started showing pop-up messages to many Kindle users on the web. Until then, the ability to download books on a PC and transfer them to Kindle devices via USB transfer should work flawlessly for consumers.</p>
<p>Amazon notes that users would still be able to send downloaded Kindle books to their respective devices, provided they have Wi-Fi-enabled ones and by “selecting the ‘Deliver or Remove from Device’ option.”</p><p>The company; however, doesn’t mention why it is removing the feature but as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.howtogeek.com/kindle-discontinues-download-transfer-via-usb/">How-to Geek</a> points out, it appears it is to lock consumers in the Kindle ecosystem of devices and not allow side loading of books.</p><p>The popular “Download & Transfer via USB” feature is believed to be often used for downloading older purchased books removing their DRM (Digital Rights Management), and converting them to a more universal ePUB format so that they can be imported to other rival book apps similar to Kindle.</p>
<p>The initial purpose of the feature was to import purchased books to Kindle devices that didn’t feature Wi-Fi connectivity and relied on cellular — but that applied to devices released before 2011.</p><p>The new move; however, would likely save from making pirated copies of the books, which seems hassle-free to an extent with the aforementioned functionality. Regardless, it appears to be an encouraging move from Amazon to keep its users glued to its devices’ ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1inr9uy/fyi_amazon_is_removing_download_transfer_option">FYI Amazon is removing Download & Transfer option on Feb 26th</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle">r/kindle</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kindle/comments/1inr9uy/comment/mce7ejs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">recent Reddit post</a>, users who bought the books through the Kindle store and downloaded them to their Kindle device through Wi-Fi or a cellular network are not affected by the removal of this tool. Similarly, users who have side-loaded books through USB are not affected. Kindle app users on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android are also not affected.</p>

The trio of smartphones — the Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra — are equipped with a bunch of Google AI and Galaxy AI tools and features. One of them is called AI Drawing Assist, and it's a general term for all the ways Galaxy AI can turn quick doodles into generative AI masterpieces.</p><p>AI Drawing Assist can be used throughout the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> that powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> and is accessible in a few different ways. If you're curious about how to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung apps and across One UI, this guide covers everything you need to know.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-ai-drawing-assist-supported-apps-devices"><span>AI Drawing Assist: Supported apps & devices</span></h3>
<p>AI Drawing Assist is available on the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 series</a>, but also older Galaxy phones, including the S24 series, S23 series, S22 series, Z Fold 6, Z Flip 6, Z Fold 5, Z Flip 5, Z Fold 4, Z Flip 4, Tab S10 series, Tab S9 series, and Tab S8 series. It's not available on the Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS10003469/" target="_blank">Samsung</a>. "Ultra" phones that feature an S Pen will have access to more precise drawing or sketching, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra can't use Air Commands like older S Pen-equipped models.</p><p>The official Samsung Notes and Gallery apps have built-in support for AI Drawing Assist. Alternatively, you can use AI Drawing Assist anywhere by calling up AI Smart Select or Drawing Assist from the Edge panel.</p>

<p>The easiest way to use AI Drawing Assist is by opening the Edge panel, which can be done from anywhere in One UI. From there, you can use Smart Select to alter any image on your screen or use Drawing Assist to create one from scratch. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Swipe left on the Edge panel</strong> toward the upper-right part of the screen.</p><p>2. Tap either <strong>AI Select</strong> or <strong>Smart Select</strong>, depending on what is shown on your device.</p><p>3. With AI Select or Smart Select, <strong>tap on something on your screen</strong> to select it.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> or <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> to open the editor. <strong>Draw something</strong> or use <strong>text to describe what you want to change</strong>.</p><p>5. From there, <strong>tap one of the six Drawing Assist styles</strong> and press <strong>Generate</strong>.</p>

<p>6. When you're happy with your image, use the <strong>toolbar</strong> to <strong>copy</strong> the creation to your clipboard, <strong>share it</strong>, or <strong>download it</strong>.</p>
<p>After that, you've made your first Drawing Assist creation. If you don't need to remix an existing image and want to start your own from scratch, you can skip the Smart Select process by pressing <strong>Drawing Assist</strong> directly from the Edge panel.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-with-samsung-gallery"><span>How to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung Gallery</span></h3>
<p>AI Drawing Assist is built into certain Samsung apps, with no need to use the Edge panel. The stock Samsung Gallery app — not Google Photos —  is one of them. Here's how to use Drawing Assist and Sketch to Image in the Gallery app:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Gallery app</strong> and <strong>tap a photo</strong> you want to edit.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Photo Assist icon</strong> (it looks like three stars).</p><p>3. Press the <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> button.</p><p>4. Use the <strong>drawing tool</strong> to <strong>sketch what you want to add</strong> to the photo. You can use the <strong>eraser tool</strong> and <strong>undo/redo buttons</strong> to refine the sketch.</p><p>5. Tap <strong>Generate</strong> when you're finished sketching.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CBCGsBZPCFjVCBXuGLSHqi" name="Gallery-AI-Drawing-Assist" alt="Screenshots for using AI Drawing Assist in Samsung apps." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CBCGsBZPCFjVCBXuGLSHqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>6.<strong> </strong>Press <strong>Save copy </strong>when finished.</p>
<p>Now, the photo you edited with AI Drawing Assist will be saved to your Gallery.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-use-ai-drawing-assist-with-samsung-notes"><span>How to use AI Drawing Assist with Samsung Notes</span></h3>
<p>A similar mechanism for using AI Drawing Assist is available in Samsung Notes. After sketching something in Notes, you can refine it with Sketch to Image and Drawing Assist. Here's how it works:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Create a new note</strong> in <strong>Samsung Notes</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Note Assist icon</strong> (it looks like three stars).</p><p>3. Press <strong>Sketch to Image</strong> and <strong>select the drawing</strong> you want to edit.</p><p>4. Pick a <strong>Drawing Assist style</strong> and tap <strong>Generate</strong>.</p>

<p>If AI Drawing Assist on the Samsung Galaxy S25 sounds a little familiar, it should. We've seen many of these features on past Galaxy phones and tablets, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a>, but they haven't been tightly integrated like they are on the Galaxy S25. Specifically, this is the first time AI Drawing Assist can handle multiple inputs — like a photo and a sketch, or a photo and a text-to-image prompt.</p><p>This makes AI Drawing Assist on the Galaxy S25 more versatile than ever, and it's a fun way to one-up your notes are images. During my testing of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">base Galaxy S25</a>, I got more than a few great images using Samsung's generative AI.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>As much as we love the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, most buyers looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new Android phone</a> are probably going to choose between Google or Samsung handsets. They're available through U.S. carriers, are familiar to longtime Android users, and offer best-in-class software. Now that the Samsung Galaxy S25 and Google Pixel 9 are out, I used both phones side-by-side to figure out which one is best.</p><p>We already have a full breakdown of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-google-pixel-9">how the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 shake up on paper</a>, so I'm going to focus on the intangibles here. Things like how each phone feels in the hand or what it's like to use Pixel UI or One UI 7 on a daily basis. Boy, are there a lot of them. You might think that as the base-model representatives of the Galaxy S25 and Pixel 9 series, these two phones have a lot in common, but that just isn't the case.</p><p>The biggest thing you'll notice when picking up either device is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> is lighter, and not by an insignificant margin. It only weighs 162, which makes it the lightest major flagship on the market in the U.S. By comparison, the Pixel 9 weighs 198 grams, and that's more than the Galaxy S25 Plus. Google may have figured out how to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> feel premium this generation, but it hasn't cracked the perfect weight yet.</p><p>The Galaxy S25's weight, plus its compact form factor overall, makes me want to pick it up more than the Pixel 9. It's more comfortable to hold, and I can promise that you'll notice the 36-gram difference without needing to look at the spec sheet. It makes even more of a difference if you like to use your smartphone with a case, because that'll of course add more weight and thickness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UyMEvnEcXG8J7fJjsGFpmc" name="Galaxy-S25-vs-Pixel-9-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 compared to the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UyMEvnEcXG8J7fJjsGFpmc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S25 overall, and I'm not sure that's a good thing. The former has a 6.3-inch display, while the latter has a 6.2-inch display. At 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm, the Galaxy S25 is downright tiny, especially when you factor in the rear cameras. They protrude less from the back glass than the Pixel 9's camera bar, so it won't rock as much on a table.</p><p>The displays themselves use similar technology. They're both OLED panels with 120Hz variable refresh rate support and high brightness capabilities. I'd say the Galaxy S25 is slightly less reflective and is easier to view outside, but both are excellent and flat screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="aRv9URHyeYbD7pgSwZpzsc" name="Galaxy-S25-vs-Pixel-9-3" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 compared to the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aRv9URHyeYbD7pgSwZpzsc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When the Pixel 9 first came out, it was my favorite Android base model yet, and I thought it was capable of going toe-to-toe with the iPhone 16. It would've taken a lot for the Galaxy S25 to top the Pixel 9 in my book, and Samsung did just the right things for that to happen. To be clear, Samsung didn't do everything perfectly. I wanted to see new camera hardware and a fresh design. But it did the <em>right </em>things.</p><p>What do I mean by that? Well, Google has always had a pitch with the Pixel lineup. By going with the Pixel 9, you might not have a phone that wins every benchmark. However, you're going to get a device that is very well-optimized, has fantastic software, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">and excels at AI tasks</a>. Here's the thing: the Samsung Galaxy S25 is arguably better optimized, with just-as-good software, and with better AI tasks.</p><p>Samsung and Qualcomm worked together to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset</a>, and it's a breakthrough. Geekbench 6 tests below provide a snapshot of how the Galaxy S25 performs against the Pixel 9 in synthetic workflows. Samsung wins, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4">and it's not particularly close</a>.</p>

<p>More importantly, the Galaxy S25 is now the leader in AI processing — a title the Pixel 9 held not too long ago. Google's Tensor G4 processor ran laps around the outgoing Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in the Galaxy S24, since it could process up to 45 tokens per second. Qualcomm answered with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for Galaxy mobile platform that can handle 70 tokens per second for AI tasks, besting Google's flagship.</p><p>So, the Galaxy 25 is better at raw performance and AI processing, but what about software? I've been the first to criticize One UI over the years — I've written multiple articles slamming Samsung's tendencies to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wants-you-to-move-to-google-messages-and-its-for-the-best">bog phones down with bloat and duplicate apps</a>. However, there is no getting around the fact that One UI 7 is a breakthrough, and it might beat Pixel UI for the first time.</p><p>The reason I quite enjoy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-home-up-complete-customize-demo">One UI 7</a> on the Galaxy S25 is that it gives you the best of both Google AI and Galaxy AI. It has great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Circle to Search support and was the first phone to support Gemini's multi-app actions. It also has Magic Editor support via Google Photos. On top of that, it has all of Samsung's magic, including Object Eraser, AI Drawing Assist, and AI Select.</p><p>It's not an exaggeration to say that Samsung is offering the best of both worlds with the Galaxy S25. Meanwhile, Google might have a few Pixel software exclusives, but there's no way to get the expansive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite on a Pixel 9.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nJWrWzLGhnfRr83qSQkwjc" name="Galaxy-S25-vs-Pixel-9-4" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 compared to the Google Pixel 9." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJWrWzLGhnfRr83qSQkwjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Put it all together, and I think the choice between the Galaxy S25 and the Pixel 9 is clear. The former is lighter, more compact, and faster, with more AI and software features.</p><p>Now, before you run to buy a Galaxy S25 for $800, there is a limitation you should know about. It's the camera system, which has been recycled since the Galaxy S22 series and is getting <em>extremely </em>old. As you can see from the photos I've captured with the Galaxy S25 in the gallery below, that leads to results that are just okay.</p>

<p>If you need better cameras, get the Google Pixel 9. That's basically the only reason I'd recommend the Pixel 9 over the Galaxy S25, which is not something I expected to write before testing these phones side-by-side.</p><p>The reality is that Samsung has officially surpassed Google in terms of raw performance, optimization, and AI processing. With many of Google's best AI features coming to the Galaxy S25, there's little reason to favor the Pixel 9 as it currently stands.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This year's crop of flagship Android phones represents something of a victory lap for Qualcomm. Half a decade ago, Apple successfully scaled its A-series phone chips up to the laptop and desktop level. Now, Qualcomm is experiencing a similar leap in reverse. It designed laptop and desktop-class Snapdragon X Elite chips and brought their staple custom Oryon cores to the mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) level with the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform.</p><p>As my colleague Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-mediatek-dimensity-9400-vs-google-tensor-g4">recently confirmed in benchmark testing</a>, the Snapdragon 8 Elite crushes what MediaTek and Google comparatively offer. However, Samsung and Qualcomm threw us a curveball when they co-designed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor. It's a custom chip based on the Snapdragon 8 Elite platform but tailored to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series of smartphones.</p><p>That begs the question: how much better is the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip than the regular version? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">In their announcement</a>, the two companies touted the custom chip's excellence in image processing, gaming, powering Galaxy AI features, and connectivity. Is that enough to make you think twice about buying a flagship with a standard Snapdragon 8 Elite chip?</p><p>To find out, the team at Android Central tested a slew of Snapdragon 8 Elite–powered devices against the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Ultra. For our Snapdragon 8 Elite lineup, we tested the Honor Magic 7 Pro, iQOO 13, RedMagic 10 Pro, and Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro. We then stacked that up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">benchmark scores of the Galaxy S25 Ultra from Andrew Myrick's review</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25's scores from my review</a>.</p><p>To say that the results were surprising would be an understatement. While the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip is plenty powerful, it rarely beats other top Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p>

<p>We know a bit about the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. For starters, it's overclocked slightly higher than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">base Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> — the SoC can hit  4.47 GHz compared to 4.32 GHz. However, Qualcomm and Samsung haven't shared much else about the chip's under-the-hood tweaks.</p><p>After running our full slate of benchmark tests, including PCMark, 3DMark, Geekbench 6, and Geekbench AI, it's clear that the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy does not win often against Snapdragon 8 Elite–powered devices. Three out of four of Snapdragon 8 Elite phones — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-basically-a-power-bank-attached-to-a-gaming-phone">RedMagic 10 Pro</a>, and ROG Phone 9 Pro — posted higher PCMark overall scores than both Galaxy S25 devices. The latter two phones crushed the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy devices by a margin of nearly 5,000 points.</p><p>That general theme is consistent throughout our slate of benchmarks and stress testing. Aside from the iQOO 13, the other three Snapdragon 8 Elite phones edge out the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy–powered models almost every time. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, a $1,299 Samsung flagship, didn't come in first place in a single test. For some reason, the base Galaxy S25 performed better, but it still didn't stack up against the best Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p><p>The takeaway here shouldn't be that the Galaxy S25 is better than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, or that the Asus ROG Phone 9 Pro is better than the Honor Magic 7 Pro. Instead, these benchmarking results signal that how a manufacturer chooses to run its processor of choice matters much more than whether it's the regular Snapdragon 8 Elite chip or the "for Galaxy" variant.</p>

<p>There's no better proof of this than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a>, which has the same chip as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ROG Phone 9 Pro</a> but performs nearly 10,000 points lower in certain benchmark tests. The problem here isn't Snapdragon 8 Elite, it's that iQOO is artificially limiting the chip's performance. There could be a number of reasons for that, including battery life, TDP, or thermal throttling concerns.</p><p>It's likely that Samsung is doing something similar with the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor in the Galaxy S25 series. It may be overclocked and customized for Galaxy phones, but the results speak for themselves: this chip isn't reaching its full potential. It's impossible to know why Samsung went this route for sure, though we noticed slight performance dips due to thermal throttling during graphics stress tests on both the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>Really, these results prove that you don't need to pick a smartphone for its processor in 2025. Benchmarks aside, all the phones tested are capable devices that have performed excellently in daily use. Even devices not listed here, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a>, are more than capable.</p><p>While it's clear that Samsung is doing impressive things with on-device AI and the Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy platform, it's not materially better than all the other Snapdragon 8 Elite phones.</p>

<p>EssilorLuxottica, the main partner behind Meta’s smart glasses, has revealed how well the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> are doing. Turns out, since launching in October 2023, they’ve already sold over 2 million pairs.</p><p>The latest revelation comes hot on the heels of Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s announcement a few weeks back, where he shared that the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses hit one million sales in 2024.</p><p>The smart glasses have been such a hit that EssilorLuxottica is ramping up production in a big way. As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/ray-ban-meta-glasses-sold-2-units-production-to-be-vastly-increased/" target="_blank">UploadVR</a>, the manufacturer is aiming to churn out a whopping 10 million units a year by the end of 2026.</p><p>Meta is going all out to push its smart glasses, even dropping big-budget Super Bowl ads starring A-list celebrities. This heavy-hitting promotion shows just how serious it is about keeping sales on the rise for the rest of the year.</p><p>During EssilorLuxottica’s FY2024 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/investors/financial-publications/" target="_blank">earnings call</a>, CEO and Chairman Francesco Milleri predicted that glasses are set to become the go-to digital platform for tackling our everyday needs.

The bigger panel meant I was able to get a decent amount of work done on the iPad Pro by connecting a mechanical keyboard. <br><br>As much as I like the iPad Pro M2, I wanted an iPad with an OLED panel, so I was immediately excited for the iPad Pro M4. The tablet is available in 11 and 13-inch variants, and I knew I needed the bigger screen, so that's the one I went with. After six months of extensive use involving plenty of writing with the Magic Keyboard and a dozen or so external keyboards, playing over a hundred hours of games (mostly Balatro), reading ebooks, doodling in Procreate, and messing around with synths, I'm ready to say it — this is the best iPad I've ever used. <br><br>That was never in doubt anyway, but the changes to the design and the OLED panel make the latest iPad Pro a rather enticing upgrade, and if you're using an older tablet or are mulling a switch, here's what you need to know about this M4-powered beast.</p>

<p>Apple unveiled the iPad Pro M4 on May 7, 2024, and the tablet is now available globally. It is sold in a 11-inch model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7FC1P/ref=sr_1_2?crid=S8H3AAHGLATF&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.CI6OrrdQaMgkBhgDIo4G3LA-OJLslwe7VIIy7QKiS02ZcQZxXf-NhZRpcdcCYJiPopyMsfntaXDpRZRjV8xmuXsXjgVq6npRNN3m-T_YgdkDH1VBKkoc8yM4VUyGW8PETM_xZkTkXH766KQEiVl_iW-pp-JWXJdS3AqrGjo6XUqY9AimbWaW0YQZ5a6JnUgUNPK3HYHYYZPiSLfawgGZ1gnbwZMPoKUSXqNEcMSZkn8.vsiJ3_X7hpw6TFHNHtLKvDooPbNEr572xkvqse2SlaQ&dib_tag=se&keywords=iPad%2BPro%2BM4&qid=1739157688&sprefix=ipad%2Bpro%2B13%2Bm4%2B%2Caps%2C477&sr=8-2&th=1">that starts at $999</a> for the base 256GB configuration, going up to $1,199 for the 512GB edition, $1,599 for the 1TB variant, and $1,999 if you need 2TB of storage. These are the standard Wi-Fi-only models; if you need cellular connectivity, you'll need to shell out an additional $200. <br><br>The 13-inch iPad Pro M4 debuted at $1,299 for the 256GB variant, but it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence/dp/B0D3J7FC1P">now available for $1,099 at Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/apple-13-inch-ipad-pro-m4-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-wi-fi-256gb-with-oled-space-black/6533540.p?skuId=6533540">Best Buy</a>. The 512GB model costs $1,499, the 1TB variant is $1,899, and the 2TB option costs $2,299. If you're interested in the 1TB or 2TB models, you can get a glare-resistant nano-textured panel that's aimed at color-sensitive work, with this option costing an additional $100. Like the 11-inch model, you'll need to pay $200 more if you want cellular connectivity. <br><br>I'm using the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 in Space Black — it's also available in Silver — and I have the 1TB model with standard glass and cellular connectivity. I also got the new Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard, and the total cost of the tablet and accessories is a heady $2,577.</p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-design"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2prjzMCwhNv7KjUoLuTRC6" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2prjzMCwhNv7KjUoLuTRC6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design is a key talking about with the iPad Pro M4, and the sleek chassis absolutely makes a difference. The iPad Pro is noticeably thinner and lighter than previous years, and the 13-inch model in particular is incredible. Coming in at just 5.1mm, it is the thinnest Apple product I used yet, and it feels fantastic to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="65Q2LKnrgkoHKhawzRNvh5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/65Q2LKnrgkoHKhawzRNvh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Weight is also a big consideration, and coming in at 579g, the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 is a full 103g lighter than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2, and that's a huge deal. The thinner chassis and significantly lighter weight makes the iPad Pro M4 that much easier to handle, and even though this is an oversized tablet, you just don't get that sense in daily use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vvYzaT5ZJgmQE6NibnNxh5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vvYzaT5ZJgmQE6NibnNxh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While I use most phones without a case, the sheer size of the iPad means you'll need to invest in a folio case at the least to give the tablet added protection. The chassis is made out of recycled aluminum, and while I didn't test its durability, there's no flex whatsoever, and there are no problems with build quality.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="us7tNEeFSQSZu6uo6S2ds5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/us7tNEeFSQSZu6uo6S2ds5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The overall aesthetic itself is unchanged from previous years; the dull grey design language doesn't stand out too much, and you get antennae lines at the top and bottom. The USB-C port is located at the bottom, and you get four speakers that get loud. The power button is up top, and like its predecessor, Face ID is the standard way to unlock the tablet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="H357xkheEEvw2N97nKrJg5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H357xkheEEvw2N97nKrJg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, Apple finally moved the position of the front camera, and it's now located on the leading edge. You no longer have to awkwardly position the tablet to center your frame in meetings, and while it's a small change, it's long overdue. The 12MP front camera uses Center Stage to position you in the center even if you're moving around, and the video quality is decent enough — I attended dozens of briefings and made hundreds of FaceTime calls using the iPad Pro, and didn't see any issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cFZP97AQJdyydQcVCz3Qg5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cFZP97AQJdyydQcVCz3Qg5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the global <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a> still has a physical SIM card slot, Apple is going all-in on eSIM with the iPad Pro M4, and if you opt for the cellular model, you only get eSIM instead of a nano-SIM slot like the iPad Pro M2. This isn't a big deal as it's easy to set up eSIM on the iPad Pro, but I would have preferred the convenience of a traditional SIM tray. <br><br>Other than that minor quibble, I've had zero issues with the design or build quality of the iPad Pro M4. After my work monitor and the Kindle Oasis, the iPad Pro M4 got the most amount of usage in the last six months, and it held up incredibly well.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-panel"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Panel</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6fwuncg4ojcGDSGyXkerH6" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6fwuncg4ojcGDSGyXkerH6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The defining feature on the iPad Pro M4 is the 13-inch Ultra Retina XDR OLED panel. It has ProMotion tech and goes up to 120Hz, has a wide color gamut, and the True Tone engine. The resolution is increased to 2752 x 2064 to get to the 13-inch size up from 12.9 inches, but the pixel density is the same at 264ppi.</p>
<p>What's interesting about the panel is that the iPad Pro M4 uses tandem OLED tech, where two OLED panels are combined to deliver greater brightness. This addresses one of the biggest issues with OLEDs — high brightness levels — and Apple said it used tandem OLEDs to ensure the tablet gets adequately bright. If anything, the iPad Pro M4 manages to outshine its predecessor. It is able to go up to 1000 nits in regular use, hitting 1600 nits in HDR content.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vKdtZotVaEKqDvKKuKhSj5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKdtZotVaEKqDvKKuKhSj5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I didn't see any issues with brightness levels whatsoever, and having used the tablet outdoors extensively, there was never a scenario where the screen didn't get bright enough — even under harsh sunlight. The standard glass panel has an anti-reflective coating, and it does a decent job in its own right; that said, the nano-textured coating is the way to go if you're going to predominantly use the iPad outdoors.</p>
<p>The switch to OLED delivers much better colors, and the iPad Pro M4 has been an absolute delight to use for reading, gaming, streaming content, and making music. The fact that you now get true blacks and excellent color vibrancy means the iPad Pro M4 has a distinct edge, and HDR content in particular comes alive on the 13-inch panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gpxyzhHZx4mnvoFzux2fe5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gpxyzhHZx4mnvoFzux2fe5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a noticeable difference in color fidelity over the mini-LED iPad Pro M2, and the quality of the panel itself is worth the upgrade if you're on an older iPad. Basically, this isn't the best panel on any iPad, but one of the best OLED displays I've ever used, and Apple nailed the technicalities. I used phones with tandem OLED tech as well — notably the Honor Magic 6 RSR — but the difference isn't as evident on a smaller device.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-hardware-and-battery-life"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Hardware and battery life</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uCHhf8WGCvRoZ48YFjB5f5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCHhf8WGCvRoZ48YFjB5f5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 has the best hardware package of any tablet today. The outgoing iPad Pro M2 was already a powerhouse in this regard, and the switch to M4 silicon makes things that much more interesting. You get decent efficiency gains as well with the move to a 3nm manufacturing node. <br><br>The M4 variant you get changes with the storage configuration. The 1TB and 2TB models come with a 10-core CPU that includes four performance cores and six efficiency cores, and they have a 10-core GPU, hardware-accelerated ray tracing engine, 160core neural engine, and a memory bandwidth of 120GB/s. These models also get 16GB of RAM as standard, so if you're unsure about which option to get, I'd suggest picking up the 1TB variant.</p>
<p>By contrast, the 256GB and 512GB models get a 9-core CPU that features three performance cores instead. The memory is halved at 8GB, but other than that, the rest of the hardware is identical. There's ProRes and AV1 decode, Wi‑Fi 6E with Bluetooth 5.3, Sub-6 5G on the cellular model, and Thunderbolt 3 as well as USB 4 connectivity over USB-C. You get the standard magnetic pins at the back that let you dock the iPad Pro with the Magic Keyboard and associated accessories.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U6uSa23sCnEp8DjXq47bs5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6uSa23sCnEp8DjXq47bs5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, this is the most powerful iPad around. It blazes through console-quality games and demanding video-editing tasks without a sweat, and in the six months I had it, I didn't feel like the full potential of the M4 was being utilized. There isn't any utility that challenges the hardware as such, and frankly, the M4 is overkill for mundane tasks.</p><p>I don't use the iPad to take photos, so I can't reasonably talk about the 12MP camera in any great detail. That said, the few shots I managed came out decent enough. Most of my usage was with the front camera, and it is a little better than the one on the iPad Pro M2.</p><p>There isn't anything amiss on the battery front either; the 13-inch iPad Pro M4 has a 10300mAh battery, and it lasts a smidgen longer than the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2 even though the battery size is smaller. I easily get a day's worth of use when using the iPad exclusively to write, browse the web, and play games, and battery anxiety just isn't a thing with the tablet. <br><br>It takes nearly two and a half hours to charge the iPad Pro M4, with the tablet maxing out at 30W. It's not a huge drawback as you get great battery life in general, but fast charging isn't anywhere as good as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> and tablets.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2vRkEG7zSGeFbFgLC8CW26" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2vRkEG7zSGeFbFgLC8CW26.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new Magic Keyboard costs $349, which is as much as the iPad 10th generation. Obviously, cost plays a big part in your purchasing decision, and if you want to maximize value, you'll need to pick up an aftermarket option. That said, I like this iteration of the Magic Keyboard quite a bit. The hinge is sturdier, and it doesn't have any wobble when using the keyboard on a table. <br><br>The aluminum frame gives it much better rigidity, and the new trackpad is fantastic to use. Also, the fact that you get a function row is a big deal, and it makes a difference in daily use. The keys have decent 1mm travel, and the scissor-style design is identical to what you get on a MacBook. You get good backlight, and there's enough spacing that it doesn't actually feel like you're using a mobile keyboard. <br><br>Just like the iPad Pro M4, the Magic Keyboard is thinner and lighter, and it doesn't add too much bulk to the device. The best part continues to be the cantilever mechanism, and the easy adjustability makes it a great choice.</p>

<p>The Apple Pencil Pro is my favorite iPad Pro m4 accessory. I've always been a fan of the Pencil, and the Pencil Pro includes a haptic engine that delivers excellent feedback when using the stylus. There's a new squeeze gesture that pulls up utilities as needed — it surfaces a palette if you're drawing — and a double tap gesture allows you to easily switch between tools. <br><br>There's even a barrel roll feature that makes a big difference when jotting notes, and I ended up using the iPad Pro M4 to take notes mostly because of this addition.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XnkoNb2js8q87zzDi9xYD6" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XnkoNb2js8q87zzDi9xYD6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 runs iPadOS 18.3, and while you don't get much in the way of new features, there are better privacy controls and increased customizability. I don't usually take notes on my iPad — I have a physical journal — but the updates to handwritten notes and highlighting along with the ability to transcribe audio within Notes makes it easier than ever to use the iPad as a note-taking device.</p>
<p>What I particularly like is that the Calculator now automatically solves equations — just write out the expressions and add an equals sign. I didn't have anything as convenient growing up, and it's just a cool addition. Just like iOS 18, you have the ability to style app icons, and arrange widgets and apps however you want on the home screen, and it makes a bigger difference on the iPad.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LZoSr5v85o8LNGTSDTQon5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LZoSr5v85o8LNGTSDTQon5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Control Center has dedicated pages now to control music playback and smart home devices, and it's inherently customizable. Of course, the biggest addition is Apple Intelligence; the inclusion of image generation and writing tools give the iPad Pro M4 an advantage, and while I'm not keen on generative AI, it works pretty well on the iPad.</p>
<p>The reason I continue using iPads daily is the vast software ecosystem; whether it's video and image utilities like Procreate and LumaFusion, music production apps like Korg Gadget 3, SynthMaster, and Drambo, or high-quality games, the selection is significantly better than Android. I dabble in music production, and the iPad Pro M4 is now my go-to choice when trying out a new synth or drum machine. It's just so much more convenient than using my Windows machine, and the fact that you get the same utilities on what is essentially a mobile platform is incredible.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-the-alternatives"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P9WiWvnAxR9pGVadBh6Vp5" name="Apple iPad Pro M4" alt="Apple iPad Pro M4 long-term review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P9WiWvnAxR9pGVadBh6Vp5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 doesn't have any alternatives as such; the sleeker design and OLED panel give it a definite edge over the 12.9-inch iPad Pro M2. That said, if you don't need the new additions, the iPad Pro M2 is still a great choice — if you can get it on sale. While Samsung also makes Android tablets with OLED panels, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't anywhere as good. <br><br>Ultimately, the best choice is the 11-inch iPad Pro M4. It has the same great tandem OLED and similar design, and while it isn't as thin, it is thinner and lighter than previous generations. The software is identical, and you get great battery life. If portability is a key consideration, I'd recommend the 11-inch model instead of the 13-inch iPad Pro M4.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-apple-ipad-pro-m4-should-you-buy-it"><span>Apple iPad Pro M4: Should you buy it?</span></h3>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want an iPad with an OLED panel</li><li>You need a tablet with the best hardware</li><li>You want excellent battery life</li><li>You need robust software</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need an affordable iPad</li><li>You want a MacBook rival</li></ul>
<p>The iPad Pro M4 delivers everything I need in a tablet. The 13-inch tandem OLED is one of the best displays of any device I've used, and it is magnificent in daily use — whether it's streaming content, reading text, or gaming. The ultra-thin design is a big differentiator as well, and the iPad Pro M2 feels big and unwieldy next to the M4 model. <br><br>There are absolutely no issues when it comes to the hardware, and the vast accessory ecosystem means you can get a reliable keyboard case and stylus if you don't want to get the Magic Keyboard and Pencil Pro. Battery life is pretty great too, and the front camera is much better this time around. <br><br>It's the software that makes me come back to the iPad Pro M4. Yes, iPadOS isn't as versatile as macOS, and multitasking is still a challenge — that doesn't bother me in the least. I predominantly use the iPad Pro M4 to focus on one thing at a time — whether it's writing in Evernote, learning Procreate, reading a book, or trying out a new synth — and the software is well-suited for that use case. <br><br>Ultimately, choosing the iPad Pro M4 comes down to money; it is one of the costliest options in this category, but you get a lot of tablet for the cash. If you need the absolute best that Apple has to offer, the iPad Pro M4 is a wholehearted recommendation. But if you need something that's more affordable, there's no shortage of options.</p>

<p>Google’s Android quake alert system accidentally set off a wave of notifications across Brazil last week, causing a bit of chaos. As a result, the company decided to hit pause on the service for a while to sort things out.</p><p>The tech giant has temporarily shut down its Android earthquake alerts in Brazil after a glitch caused a false alarm in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnnbrasil.com.br/nacional/sudeste/sp/google-pede-desculpas-e-diz-que-investiga-falso-alerta-de-terremoto/" target="_blank">CNN Brasil</a> reported (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-android-earthquake-alerts-false-alarm-brazil/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Early Friday morning, around 2 AM, folks were jolted awake by warnings of a 5.5 magnitude quake that never happened, with the system mistakenly pointing to Ubatuba and Baixada Santista as the epicenters.</p><p>São Paulo’s Civil Defense confirmed there was no seismic activity and clarified they didn’t send out any alerts, making it clear the Android warnings were a total mix-up.</p><p>Google owned up to the blunder, stating that the system got confused by some offshore activity near São Paulo, which led to the bogus alerts. It has since apologized for the false alarm.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-rolls-out-global-earthquake-detection-network-powered-android-phones">Android Earthquake Alerts System</a>, launched in the U.S. in 2020, works by tapping into data from tons of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Using their built-in motion sensors, these devices can pick up on the first, weaker tremors (called P-waves) that hit before the stronger shaking (S-waves) kicks in. The idea is to give people a heads-up—just a few extra seconds—before the real shaking starts.</p><p>Essentially, Google’s earthquake alerts system turns smartphones into mini seismometers. Since launching more than four years ago, it has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-earthquake-alerts-system-expands-greece-new-zealand">expanded to places like Greece and New Zealand</a>.</p><p>This is the system’s first major false alarm since launch. While it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66316462" target="_blank">reportedly missed alerts</a> during the 2023 Turkey earthquake, Google insists it worked as expected.</p><p>Google hasn’t revealed the exact cause yet, but it has shut down the alert system across Brazil while investigating the incident.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google TV Freeplay removed three free holiday-themed Xumo channels: Holiday Movie Channel, Holiday Classics, and Christian Christmas.</li><li>OutTV Proud and Shades of Black made a return after being removed earlier this month.</li><li>This shuffle comes just months after Google TV beefed up its lineup to 170+ free channels, including holiday picks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google TV’s Freeplay has pulled the plug on three free channels, including a couple of holiday-themed ones.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-tv-removes-adds-more-free-channels/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Freeplay just axed three holiday-themed Xumo channels: the Holiday Movie Channel, Holiday Classics, and Christian Christmas.</p><p>Meanwhile, OutTV Proud and Shades of Black are back after being pulled earlier this month. That said, the other channels that got the axe are still missing for now.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv">Google TV</a> Freeplay’s latest channel shuffle comes just a few months after it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tv-sneaks-in-dozens-of-new-free-channels-for-you-to-skip-over">beefed up its lineup to over 170 free streams</a>, thanks in part to some holiday-themed picks.</p><p>Even after its big expansion, Google TV Freeplay has been shedding some free channels. According to 9to5, The Hill TV, Dog Whisperer with Cesar Milan, Dove Channel, Comedy Dynamics, and The Bob Ross Channel got the boot, though the channels added in the previous update managed to dodge the cuts.</p><p>It’s annoying when your go-to channels just vanish out of nowhere. Google TV Freeplay’s constant channel shuffle—adding some, dropping others—makes it tough to count on for steady viewing.</p><p>And, of course, Google isn’t exactly upfront about these changes, so it feels like a bit of a mystery. Your best move is to check its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/11167990#zippy=%2Cavailable-channels" target="_blank">support page</a> for the latest lineup, though even that might not always be current.</p><p>As you may already know, Google TV users have access to a huge selection of channels, including plenty that won’t cost a dime. If you’re in the U.S., Freeplay is a standout perk because it hooks you up with free live TV via its own app.</p><p>That said, not every channel sticks around forever since Google is always tweaking the lineup. This time, Google TV Freeplay axed three channels, but it’s not all doom and gloom.</p>

They may have some FDA-approved sensors, but there's always fine print saying to take worrying readings with a grain of salt. But smartwatch and smart ring makers are aiming for medical-grade accuracy at all costs (literally). Not necessarily for <em>your</em> peace of mind, but because there's profit to be had if the healthcare industry buys in.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-kicks-off-battery-arms-race-for-smartwatches">OnePlus Watch 3</a> dominated headlines last week because of its 5-day battery, so you probably missed the news about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-new-health-lab-is-a-big-step-for-its-wellness-technology">OnePlus opening a €13.5 million 4,840m² Health Lab</a> in Guangdong, China. Run by "medical professionals and multidisciplinary software and hardware engineers," it's designed for "long-term research collaborations" with over 30 medical companies and research institutions to study athletes' physiological data.</p><p>As a side benefit, OnePlus will use lab sensors to "improve the ability of self-developed algorithms, allowing smartwatches to better monitor exercise capacity and cardiopulmonary health."</p><p>That may all sound a bit intense, but it's no surprise. Dive into the career pages for Apple and Google, and you'll find open jobs related to clinical studies, health sensor development, data center construction, health privacy, biophotonics — the list truly goes on and on. Cardiologists and smartwatch engineers have intertwined career paths in Big Tech.</p><p>Some of this research goes into new health data points; Apple is reportedly closing in on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/wellness/smartwatches/apple-watch-ultra-3-and-apple-watch-11-rumored-to-finally-get-long-awaited-health-tracking-feature">blood pressure tracking</a>, while a Samsung exec hinted last month that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-exec-health-forum-glucose-monitoring-highlighted">non-invasive blood glucose monitoring</a> is coming soon. Pulling that off takes serious R&D.</p><p>Other research focuses on better HR algorithms for athletes, like Google claiming the Pixel Watch 3 has the "most accurate heart rate for running yet" to try and pull customers away from fitness brands like Garmin and Polar. This watch was also the first with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-loss-of-pulse-detection-explained">"Loss of Pulse" feature</a>.</p><p>But to be frank, courting athletes or consumers with health issues won't justify this investment. Google didn't buy Fitbit for $2.1 billion just to make its future Pixel Watches more accurate, and OnePlus's new sports lab isn't really about the casual athletes that wear its watches.</p><p>I believe a business-to-business (B2B) battle is coming for smartwatches (and smart rings) that are all trying to be the clinical, portable option for other industries. They're all racing to collect your data and use it to self-improve their results until they can aim their sights higher. And you getting heart health warnings or daily workout recommendations is only a side effect.</p>

<p>The other smartwatch health news that prompted this column was Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/02/new-holistic-apple-health-study-launches-today-in-the-research-app/?1739368761">announcing</a> its latest Health Study on how to use technology to "predict, detect, monitor, and manage changes in participants’ health," across "a number of health and disease areas, including activity, aging, cardiovascular health, circulatory health, cognition, hearing, menstrual health, mental health, metabolic health, mobility, neurologic health, respiratory health, sleep, and more."</p><p>This ambitious, holistic study isn't being handled in a creepy way: It's an opt-in program with options on what you share with researchers, and Apple itself doesn't get identifying information.</p><p>What it will get is the overall results, from potentially millions of customers, showing which data its watches successfully track and which areas it fails at, adding context that it can't normally find out on its own.</p><p>That kind of data can be incredibly valuable for preventative care, if it can analyze your health and workout trends and warn you of potential changes to your physiology or mental capacity. That <em>could</em> help you, but it'll certainly help Apple keep you in its device ecosystem if it keeps marketing its Watches as life-saving.</p>

<p>Everyone is intrigued by blood pressure and glucose, but we're seeing right now how smartwatches are analyzing your AGEs Index, arterial stiffness, and other niche bodily health information that's tied to long-term health warning signs. I don't think any <em>consumers</em> were asking for this; I think it's a proof of concept for doctors to prove how useful these devices can be if they join forces.</p><p>Imagine if Apple partnered with your healthcare provider and could key in its watches to look out for <em>specific</em> biomarkers related to your condition or genetics. Some smartwatches can already collect data to send to your doctor, but perhaps these apps could automatically send reports, either at regular intervals or whenever there's a sustained issue with a given metric.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">Smart ring</a> sales are so niche that they're barely worth mentioning compared to smartwatches. But I think it's relevant that so many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/we-saw-three-potential-futures-for-smart-rings-at-ces">smart ring brands at CES</a> pushed their medical-grade accuracy and brought up unprompted the idea of B2B sales to medical companies.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/circular-ring-2-will-add-ecg-readings-and-8-day-battery-life-at-a-cost">Circular Ring 2</a> ditched the company's trademark haptic engine for an FDA-approved ECG; in the CEO's words, they're transitioning from wellness to an alternative for "expensive" and "invasive" medical checks. The Evie Ring got FDA approval for blood oxygen readings, and its CEO also labeled it as a "clinical-grade device for B2B channels." Ultrahuman wants you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/blood-vision">send them blood</a> so they can compare your smart ring data against your biomarkers, and Oura has its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-symptom-radar-early-stress-signs-announced">Symptom Radar</a> to link your biometrics with possible causes.</p><p>These new companies want to leapfrog wellness straight into the health industry for a reason. Either they think it's a market ready to be tapped, or they think "wellness" alone will be seen as less marketable or profitable very soon. Whether smart rings are <em>successful</em> against Big Tech brands with more resources to throw into this gambit, they're shooting their shot.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-a-good-or-a-bad-trend-yes-2">Is this a good or a bad trend? Yes.</h2>
<p>There's nothing inherently wrong with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watches</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a>, or smart rings becoming so accurate that they can be relied upon for clinical trials. You can be skeptical that they're as accurate as these companies <em>want</em> them to be, but I won't censure them for striving for something potentially unattainable instead of coasting on "wellness" estimates.</p><p>What I worry about — and I've written about this before — is that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-challenge-of-using-smartwatches-and-smart-rings">genuinely tough to be confronted by bad smartwatch readings</a> on a daily basis.</p><p>Anyone would want their watch to catch signs of a heart attack so you can call your doctor. But if they start tracking your body's poor health markers that signal potential issues years or decades down the line, will that help you turn your life around, or just send you spiraling into stress and fatalism?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2164px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc" name="sleep-apnea-warning-apple-watch-series-10.jpeg" alt="Sleep Apnea warning on Apple Watch Series 10 and iPhone 16" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xrvyFzfnRRdYMFH8z7yCnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2164" height="1217" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know someone who spotted a potential kidney issue because their smart scale told them they were constantly dehydrated no matter how much water they drank. This was vital information to know, but in the aftermath, the smart scale app continued to warn them. They started checking this data more often, hoping lifestyle changes would immediately fix the problem; when nothing helped, they felt hopeless.</p><p>Of course I want to know if I have arterial stiffness or high blood sugar, but once I <em>do</em> know, I'll continue to be confronted by this information. Smartwatches have all these gamefied tools like daily rings meant to encourage you to become healthier, but some health issues can't be solved by a gung-ho attitude.</p>
<hr>
<p>I won't be surprised if, within the next five to ten years, we start seeing more doctors prescribing smartwatches and smart rings for at-home monitoring as an affordable alternative to expensive equipment, with these brands offering a spinoff healthcare app that highlights specific information shared with you and your doctor.</p><p>The current AI revolution will play into this, of course. Medical journals are already being fed into specialized AIs; the next step is for your actual health data and testing results to power future insights. Apple's research study and OnePlus's specialized lab will only become increasingly common, feeding AI data that (again) these companies can sell to healthcare providers.</p><p>The side effect of this is simple: You're going to get bombarded with more and more health and wellness information the moment you put on your smartwatch. And some people will be overwhelmed by it.</p><p>You can mentally prepare yourself for bad news before visiting a doctor; it's harder to do the moment you wake up and see a health warning in your smartwatch's Morning Report.</p>

<h2 id="here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-battery-life-2">Here's what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life</h2>
<p>After months of anticipation and wait, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's Galaxy S25 line-up</a> is finally here. As has been the case for the last few years, the family is comprised of three cutting-edge flagship smartphones. The base model—the Galaxy S25—packs everything from top-of-the-line hardware to an incredible triple-lens primary camera setup, all while being compact enough for one-handed use.</p><p>If you were to compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S24</a>, you'd see that the new model doesn't look all that different from its predecessor. Yes, you do get the latest in terms of hardware, lots of AI-powered tools, years of software updates, and more. But even though the phone is a little lighter than the previous-gen model, it still manages to pack in a 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The same goes for the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which both have the same battery capacity as their predecessors. While that's good, the question is, what kind of battery life can be expected from the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung says that "the Galaxy S25's battery usage time is enhanced for you to enjoy watching hours of videos, all thanks to a custom-made AP (Application Processor) and software optimization." While this claim doesn't really tell us that much, we have good news. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Android Central's Brady Snyder found the compact flagship to be more than capable of going on all day, that too with mixed-use involving everything from video streaming to taking calls. Unless you're a very heavy user, you can expect up to six hours of screen-on time and up to ten hours of screen-off time.</p><p>This is in line with the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, which can last roughly a full day on a single charge with anywhere between six to eight hours of screen-on time in our use.</p><p>We know that the Galaxy S25 series is driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, a custom version of Qualcomm's newest flagship chipset. Among other improvements, the SoC helps with the device's overall energy efficiency. In addition, the inclusion of a larger vapor chamber should also allow for better-sustained performance (especially while gaming) without having an impact on battery life.</p><p>There's no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is very much going to end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there, even more so for those who like pocketable devices. It has a premium design, blazing-fast performance, and more AI-based tricks than you can shake a stick it. Combine that with years of software support and solid battery life, and you get a top-tier Android phone that you shouldn't ignore.</p>

In a community blog post on their foldable strategy, Vale G, a OnePlus product manager, said the company is 'recalibrating their foldable strategy' and confirmed that it will be holding off on launching a OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year," the community post explained.</p><p>Since OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, the two share combined hardware and research teams, as well as a common software codebase. It looks like the focus is now fully on launching the world's thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">OPPO Find N5</a>, in the next couple of weeks. That said, OpenPlus doesn't fully rule out the possibility of launching Open 2 in the future.</p><p>"While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category," the community post added.</p>

<p>While the OnePlus Open 2 won't make an appearance this year, the company's next wearable will still launch as scheduled. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-detailed-ahead-of-launch" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first full look of its OnePlus Watch 3, which will launch on February 18 in the US, Canada, and European markets.</p><p>In a detailed press release, the OnePlus claims that this new watch is set to blend in with the user's daily needs with a "classic, premium, and durable design."  That said, the company is going full throttle on its "Never Settle" mantra by offering the Watch 3 with a whopping 16-day battery life on power saver mode and a prolonged 120 hours of battery on Smart mode. This is a bump from the 100-hour limit on its predecessor.</p>

The update came with some much-needed media, camera, and graphics features. The Beta 2 comes with something called the 'hybrid auto-exposure mode,' which allows users manual and auto-exposure options while capturing images.</p><p>Right now, users can choose either one of the above and not a combination of the two settings. With Android 16 Beta 2, they can control ISO or exposure time and use auto-exposure algorithms simultaneously.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16"> Beta 2</a> also brings actions for motion photos, a combination of still images and short videos with audio so that developers can decide where the motion photo will be saved.</p><p>Google remains on track to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">meet its new Android release schedule</a>, meaning Android 16 will be released to the public in the second quarter of 2025.</p>

The original poster displayed the "limitless" possibilities of the refreshed module in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which showcased apps and folder placement. Pinching inward on their display brought up the usual home screen editing options but with a newly added "DIY Home" button.</p><p>What's more, is that tapping on the icon gives users complete freedom over the size and orientation of an app widget or folder. With this, you could basically place any app icon anywhere you'd like on the home screen without following the rules of the usual grid. The user is also able to overlap widgets and apps for a truly chaotic home screen. The demo only shows these changes applying to the apps above the bottom toolbar like messaging, phone calls, contacts, or anything else. Additionally, tapping a folder that's been rotated or upside down will open apps in it as normal.</p><p>People enrolled in the beta program can give these customizations a go. However, the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">reportedly pushing back the stable rollout</a> of this OS on the Galaxy S24 due to a display coloring issue. Samsung stated that One UI 7 was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">preparing to hit</a> older Galaxy S devices "imminently" in Q1 2025.</p>

According to Mark Gurman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, TikTok was first spotted on the Apple App Store. Several other users took to X, stating that the app had on Feb. 12. It looks like the app was being made available in phases and rolled out to most users today Feb.14.</p><p>Additionally, the publication reports that the app has reappeared on the Google Play Store. Android Central has also spotted TikTok's availability via the Play Store, so users who may have deleted the app or never had it can now download it.</p><p>While this may be good news for several avid TikTok-ers, Bloomberg states it has 75 days (from Jan 20) to find common ground with the U.S. government over privacy/security concerns. This looks like an interim solution while the company buys time to settle things with the present authorities.</p>

<p>Spotify premium subscribers had a frustrating experience this week. Despite paying $12 per month for an ad-free service, they ended up hearing commercial ads that disrupted their podcast or music. There were multiple reports of this issue on Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">community forums</a>, dating back to last Friday, Feb. 7. People were reporting issues and reaching out to support in multiple ways, with one user saying that it has been "impossible to talk to anyone at Spotify."</p><p>Only a week later, Spotify seemed to look into the issue. Spotify said, "Our tech teams are currently investigating reports of Premium users hearing ads. We'll keep you posted here if we have any news to share, so make sure to Subscribe to the thread to stay tuned."</p><p>Initially, the company asked users affected to add to the thread their device information, app version or web player, the type of ad they heard, and any troubleshooting steps they've already taken.</p><p>However, a few hours later, Spotify posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">update</a> on its community forum confirming that the issue was the result of a bug and has since been fixed. "We have good news from our teams a fix for the instances where Premium users noticed ads when listening to music has been deployed and you should notice a difference right away," the company said. "It's worth keeping in mind, however, that it is expected that both free & Premium users may still see ads when listening to podcasts."</p>

While I used to be very vocal about how Motorola just wasn't doing a good job making its low-end phones remotely useable, the company has come a long way in recent years, proving that users can still have a good experience without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">spending $1,300 for a phone</a>. And things are only going to get better for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>.</p><p>Last year, my top Android phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which retailed for $999, and it's still my daily driver because I absolutely love the form factor. However, right before I got my hands on it, I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, a phone that I was pretty sure I would forget almost as soon as I stopped using it. Instead, I didn't wanna put the phone down, even when I had to switch gears to the Razr.</p><p>The Stylus just felt like a flagship in a phone that cost half as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> would cost you today and with pretty comparable specs. It has a Full HD+ OLED display, a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, and a pretty capable 50MP primary camera. Not to mention, Motorola's signature vegan leather finish just looks and feels great.</p><p>Sure, performance may not match up to today's Snapdragon 8 Elite and all its AI flourishes, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">mid-range Snapdragon chip</a> in the Stylus was no slouch either. Combined with great performance and a solid overall package, I would constantly forget that this is a mid-range phone. In fact, my mum wants a new phone, and I'm tempted to just get her the Stylus 5G 2024, as I wouldn't get her a phone that I myself wouldn't use.</p>

<p>We're just two months into 2025, and Motorola has already launched two phones in North America. On the surface, they don't seem like much, but they've managed to exceed our expectations about the kind of experience one can expect on a phone that costs $200. Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich found himself surprised at how much he liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, especially when compared to his experience with its predecessor.</p><p>"Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> was a pretty terrible phone, even for the low price, but Motorola has turned things around and addressed nearly every complaint I had without raising the price for this year's model," he states in his review. Sutrich highlights a bright, eye-friendly display, great design, and solid battery life as major selling points for the phone.</p><p>I had a similar experience with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, which launched alongside the Moto G 2025. The design is a welcome improvement over its predecessor, especially with the improved durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating. It also handles gaming surprisingly well and comes equipped with wireless charging, which isn't very common at this price point.</p><p>That's not to say these phones are perfect. The MediaTek chip can feel sluggish the first time you do something new on the phone, but it seems to catch up in no time. Motorola also improved its software update promise to now include two OS upgrades, although that's still a far cry from what you'll get on Samsung phones, for example.</p><p>Still, for what you're paying for, these phones could be much worse than they are. Yet it seems like Motorola and other companies are upping the standards for cheap Android phones. Even this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-bad-can-this-100-nuu-phone-be">$100 phone from NUU</a> is able to provide users with a half-decent experience with <em>zero</em> bloatware, a 90Hz display, great battery life, and more.</p><p>This is great for people who don't need all the latest AI features or to spend $800+ on the best of the best. It's especially great for parents who want to buy their kids their first phone.</p><p>This was also something that OnePlus understood with its Nord N-series phones, which offered surprisingly good value. And after seeing what the company did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, I can only imagine what a new Nord N phone would be like. If you're reading this, OnePlus, now would probably be a good time to introduce a new one.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning, and so far, I'm very excited about what's to come. After all, Motorola altered my expectations about cheap Android phones with last year's Stylus 5G 2024. Things can only go up from here as components get cheaper and better, and more capable chips trickle down to the lower end.</p><p>Qualcomm is already setting the stage for a new generation of midrange phones with more AI capabilities. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">Snapdragon 6 Gen 4</a> is an upgraded version of the same chip used in last year's Stylus, and it promises better performance as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, which is a first for the 6-series. This means we will start seeing more features normally reserved for flagship phones powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> on phones that cost half the price.</p><p>Qualcomm says Realme, OPPO, and Honor will be among the first to introduce phones with the new chip. There's no word on whether or not the next Moto G Stylus will sport the new Snapdragon 6 Gen 4, but I'm looking forward to whatever we get, regardless.</p><p>As someone who still loves high-end phones like the Razr and Galaxy S25 Plus, 2025 looks like a great year to start looking at cheaper phones, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-are-tariffs-going-to-make-my-next-phone-cost-more">threat of tariffs</a> looming over.</p>

<p>Comparing the Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2 is more complicated than you'd think. The Garmin Instinct 3 has both AMOLED and MIP Solar versions in multiple sizes, each with a different battery life. The Garmin Instinct 2 and smaller 2S each have solar and non-solar options, and there's an Instinct 2X that falls in the middle between these two generations.</p><p>All three watches are almost unparalleled for battery life — not counting the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Enduro 3</a>. The Instinct 3 Solar gives you a 5X boost in solar efficiency over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2 Solar</a>, but the gap is smaller for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> owners. And even though the Instinct 3 AMOLED has no solar recharge, it may last longer or shorter than the Instinct 2 Solar depending on your lifestyle.</p><p>Now you're starting to see why this guide isn't so straightforward! But we'll break down every key difference in hardware, design, software features, and battery life across each version and generation, to help you decide whether to upgrade, stick with your current watch, or buy a last-gen model on sale for a low price.</p><p>Our previous guides on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-vs-instinct-2">Instinct vs. Instinct 2 guide</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-vs-2-solar">Instinct 2 Solar vs. 2X Solar</a> break down last-gen differences for background information. This Instinct 3 vs. Instinct 2X vs. Instinct 2 guide will focus on whether the latest generation is upgraded enough to earn your money!</p>
<h2 id="a-brief-garmin-instinct-3-amoled-vs-solar-breakdown-2">A brief Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED vs. Solar breakdown</h2>
<p>Before I compare the Instinct 3 vs. Instinct 2, I want to highlight key differences between the four Instinct 3 watches.</p>

<p>As you can see, the two 45mm models are slightly lighter and thicker than their 50mm counterparts. Both AMOLED watches have the same pixels per inch, while the smaller Instinct 3 Solar has a petite screen with a higher PPI than the 50mm Solar. The larger and smaller watches use 26mm and 22mm bands, respectively, but they should all fit the same wrist sizes.</p><p>Either MIP display is much lower-resolution and monocolored, while the AMOLED watches provide a real visual upgrade. They also add perks like on-screen workout animations, always-on display, or images from notifications that the MIP watches can't offer. But neither AMOLED nor MIP Solar has a touchscreen.</p><p>In exchange for a worse visual experience, the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar has fantastic battery recharging capable of stretching standard GPS tracking to last for weeks at a time — longer than the Instinct 3 AMOLED might last with <em>no</em> GPS tracking. Both 45mm Instinct 3 watches have a noticeable dip in battery life compared to their 50mm counterparts; you can see the differences above.</p><p>For the following sections, I'll only include the 50mm Instinct 3 AMOLED and Solar when comparing against the last-gen watches, to make the comparison less cluttered and easier to parse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-design" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another, showing the different display types." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Let's start with the Garmin Instinct series' trademark perk: Epic battery life. While the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar offered "unlimited" battery life, that was only in the context of never using GPS, using Max Battery mode (one GPS check per minute), or using Expedition mode (one GPS check per hour with no sensors or accessories). The efficiency of the solar panel wasn't especially strong.</p><p>You can see how the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar panel adds 200 estimated GPS hours of tracking, based on whether or not you're spending at least three hours a day in sunny conditions. Compared to that, the Instinct 2X Solar's 85 extra hours are respectable but well short; the Instinct 2 Solar's 18 hours felt significant back in 2022 but barely feels like a blip now.</p><p>Where the Instinct 3 Solar especially shines is for multi-band GPS tracking. Because that mode is so power-hungry, the Instinct 2X Solar could only add a few extra hours before it died. The newest model can still double your efficiency while offering the best location data that Garmin has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X" name="IMG_9784" alt="A post-run heart rate graph showing the runner's average and max heart rate across a two-mile track workout, with most heart rates in zone 4 (orange) or zone 5 (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED barely belongs in the same conversation as these MIP watches, but it's not as deficient as you might think. Its 40 GPS hours beat the Instinct 2 Solar's 30-hour estimate, only losing if you spend enough time outdoors in ideal conditions to get the recharge. You can enjoy a much better display and GPS accuracy without having to worry about the weather or hiking in the shade.</p><p>Should you upgrade for better battery life? Garmin Instinct 2X Solar buyers probably shouldn't unless they find a trade-in deal and really need an extra 100+ hours of GPS battery; you're already getting "unlimited" Max Battery or Expedition mode, so an Instinct 3 upgrade only applies if you need literal days of per-second GPS tracking and don't have any means of charging your Instinct 2X Solar overnight.</p><p>But if you have an older Instinct 1 or 2, your new battery boost will be at a whole other level — or else you can choose the Instinct 3 AMOLED and still get comparable or better battery life.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-design-and-display-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Design and display</h2>

<p>The changes across the Garmin Instinct series for this latest generation are fairly subtle. The Instinct 2X Solar is slightly heavier, but otherwise they're about the same size and weight, have the same military-grade durability against thermal, shock, and water damage, connect to the same accessories, and measure the same health data like heart rate, HRV, and blood oxygen.</p><p>While everyday people might find the Instinct series ugly — the 2X Solar scored last place in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> — fans of sporty watches will appreciate its classic look. Garmin gave the Instinct 3 a bit more personality with an aluminum bezel around the display edge that looks striking, especially on the limited-edition models that add color contrast to the bulky, monocolor silicone.</p><p>Garmin has given the memory-in-pixel Solar Instincts the same 176 x 176 resolution over the last couple of generations. That said, Garmin upped the visual contrast on the Instinct 2X compared to the Instinct 2, making it more readable, and while I haven't tested the Instinct 3 Solar myself, I've heard that this version is even more readable despite having the same pixels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All non-AMOLED Garmin Instincts have a second window that takes up visual real estate. Some Instinct 3 Solar buyers have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/01/31/garmin-instinct-3-solar-mini-display-off-centre/">complained about the data being misaligned within the circular space</a>, but it's hard to say how common these manufacturer defects are. The biggest issue is that this window — and the low resolution overall — prevent any possible maps, images, or full-screen graphs. Newer models are more readable, but none are fun to look at outside of workouts!</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has the same size and resolution as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, though slightly smaller than the 1.4-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. What's more relevant is that this display is non-touch, so you'll still have to rely fully on the Up/ Down buttons to navigate, and there is no map navigation. Still, you can trust me when I say that this upgrade makes the Instinct 3 much easier to read indoors and enables colorful graphs that look dull and blurry on the Instinct 2 or 2X.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="u79iUNx8x2msKhHeAyapEM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-side-view" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another, emphasizing their rugged designs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u79iUNx8x2msKhHeAyapEM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 2X added multi-band GPS over the GPS-only Instinct 2, matching the Instinct 3 for accuracy. The only difference is that the newer watch has SatIQ mode, which defaults to GPS alone unless the watch encounters signal interference and needs other GNSS or the L5 GPS frequency to pinpoint you. This saves hours of battery life but ensures better accuracy in tough conditions.</p><p>This mid-generation watch was also the first Instinct to add a built-in LED flashlight; the brightness is the same on the 2X and 3. It's good enough in a pinch but won't replace an <em>actual</em> flashlight or headlamp for night conditions. It burns through a healthy amount of battery, too, so the Instinct 3's more efficient solar panel might come in handy if you use it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-software-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Software</h2>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 2 shipped with most of the best Garmin Forerunner training tools available at the time, providing enough health and training load to help you become fitter and improve your VO2 Max. The gap between the Garmin Instinct 3 and 2 software isn't especially wide, but the new watches have more memory, leaving room for new feature updates that the Instinct 2 series will miss out on — and also eliminating some of the noticeable lag on the last-gen watches.</p><p>For now, the table above bolds those features that the Instinct 3 has that the 2X and 2 don't.</p><p>For health data, the Instinct 3 can detect naps for enhanced Body Battery data and will provide sleep coaching in your Morning Report. Otherwise, the data is identical, since they all use the same Elevate v4 sensors.</p><p>For general smarts, the Instinct 3 Solar isn't that different, but the AMOLED version will display notification images and (during Garmin Strength Coaching) display visual muscle maps and workout animations. It also has a large font option that the MIP watches lack. Only the Instinct 3 allows family and friends to watch you during a live event, but all the watches have a general LiveTrack tool if you want them to keep an eye on your progress during outdoor excursions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW" name="IMG_9785" alt="Exercise load bar graph on the Garmin Instinct 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUMoARmbduWcr96hWf9MzW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the training front, serious athletes will appreciate having training load focus, which splits up your recent workouts into low/ high aerobic and anaerobic types so you know what types you need to focus on to improve, as well as your training load ratio comparing this week to past weeks.</p><p>If you want to do interval training, only the Instinct 3 shows a rest timer and has improved tools like auto-detected starts and open repeats. The same goes for auto-detecting when your multisport activity has switched to the next type, or for following PacePro guidance.</p><p>If you're a runner or cyclist who wants to analyze your form, the Instinct 3 has wrist-based running dynamics — the Instinct 2 and 2X required a separate pod — and cycling dynamics like Power Phase and right/left balance.</p><p>Lastly, Instinct 2 owners will get dozens of new sports modes on the Instinct 3 series: Indoor walking, virtual running, obstacle racing, golfing, disc golf, archery, cyclocross, BMX, water skiing, snorkeling, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, tubing, boating, whitewater, XC skate skiing, ice skating, pickleball, badminton, squash, table tennis, padel, platform tennis, racquetball, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, ice hockey, football/soccer, American football, lacrosse, rugby, ultimate disc, cricket, softball, baseball, boxing, mixed martial arts, motorcycling, overlanding, motocrossing, ATVing, and snowmobiling.</p><p>It's fair to say that most of these sports profiles won't apply to your lifestyle, but anyone with niche hobbies will find the Instinct 3 more helpful at tracking them.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 is an undeniable step up on every other Instinct before it. If you're deciding between a full-priced Instinct 3 or a discounted Instinct 2, I think perks like the revamped solar charging or AMOLED, multi-band GPS, flashlight, and aluminum bezel make it worth spending full price.</p><p>But as I've previously written, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">criticize the Instinct 3 Solar</a> for how similar it is to the Instinct 2X aside from the boosted battery life. If you own the Garmin Instinct 2X, I would hold off on buying the Instinct 3, simply because you just spent $450 and you'll get diminished returns.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED is my preferred choice from a visual perspective, it doesn't have a trademark skill like the Solar watches' unlimited battery life. It's just a rugged, bulky Forerunner 265. If you can accept the lack of a flashy new perk, this is undoubtedly one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available.</p><p>If you've owned an Instinct 1 or 2 for a couple of years, it's not a bad time to upgrade. Just make sure that you really need that extra Solar battery life, or that you can do without "unlimited" max-battery excursions for a better display.</p>

Yes, it was temporarily shut down in the U.S. following a short ban. But TikTok announced in mid-January 2025 that it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">in the process of restoring service</a> and the TikTok app is now back up and running.</p><p>As you scroll, you can share a link to a video with someone on the fly using the Share button. But sometimes, there are ones you want to be able to keep locally on your device. This might be to share with others when you’ll be somewhere without a connection, like deep in the woods while camping (and wanting to practice the latest dance trend), while on a boat without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, or even when traveling if you prefer to turn off data roaming. Maybe it’s just a favorite video you want to keep for posterity. It’s easy to download a TikTok video to watch offline, as long as the creator has not disabled the download option.</p>

<h2 id="what-else-to-know-about-downloading-tiktok-videos-2">What else to know about downloading TikTok videos</h2>
<p>As noted, keep in mind that some creators disable the download option. If this is the case, you will not see the Save video option when you try to download it. If this option isn’t available, avoid trying to circumvent the rules and downloading the video through other means since the creator has not given permission for you to do so.</p><p>Even when you download a video, it will still have a TikTok watermark so the ownership of the video is known. Downloading it to watch at your leisure or share with friends while at the cabin without Wi-Fi is totally fine. Just remember never to pass off a downloaded video as your own or edit and re-post it in any manner without express permission from the content owner.</p><p>TikTok looks fabulous on all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> and while the app can be addictive, it’s important to be mindful of how much time you spend on the app as well as what you watch. Downloading videos from the site will take up valuable space on your device as well, so don’t forget to delete them once you no longer want or need them.</p>

<p>After nearly six long years, Apple finally gave the Powerbeats Pro the refresh it deserves. Beats revealed the Powerbeats Pro 2 on February 11, 2025, following months of teasers featuring high-profile athletes and celebrities.</p><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 gain many of the AirPods Pro 2's best features — including the H2 chip, ANC and transparency modes, Spatial Audio, and the ear tip fit test — plus an optical heart rate sensor for workouts and a more compact design. They also retain the original Powerbeats Pro's iconic ear hook for stability and its $250 retail price.</p><p>For people still rocking the original Powerbeats Pro years later, is it time to finally upgrade to the Powerbeats Pro 2? Or, is there any reason to get the Powerbeats Pro in 2025? After spending over five years running with the Powerbeats Pro, and testing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> side-by-side with their predecessor for the past week, I'm ready to answer both questions.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-design-and-comfort-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Design and comfort</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Powerbeats Pro (top) above Powerbeats Pro 2 (bottom). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the new Powerbeats Pro 2 beside the original Powerbeats Pro, it's clear they're both similar and a lot different. Beats kept the general idea of Powerbeats intact, with a housing shaped like a bar and an ear hook for stability. However, it's not the same hook as the Powerbeats Pro. Instead of the adjustable ear hook on the first-generation earbuds, which could be molded and retained shape, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flexible ear hook. It's half the size and will still keep your headphones from falling out.</p><p>Smaller is a theme for the Powerbeats Pro 2. The earbuds are smaller overall despite housing more technology inside. Is this a good thing? That depends. After a lot of testing, through walks, runs, and daily use, I can definitively say that I find the original Powerbeats Pro more secure and comfortable. The bigger size actually fills up my ear better, adding to the stable feel.</p><p>That isn't to say that Powerbeats Pro 2 aren't comfortable. They come with five ear tip sizes, from XS to XL, and support the ear tip fit test. This is a software tool that will let you know if you're using the right ear tip size in the Beats app for Android or the settings app for iOS. Paired with the ear hook, there was never a time I was worried about the Powerbeats Pro 2 falling out.</p>

<p>Comfort is subjective, but I'd estimate the Powerbeats Pro feel about 10% more comfortable than the Powerbeats Pro 2. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to consider.</p><p>To get the best experience, you also have to wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly. With the new design, the bar needs to be pointing sharply upward, with the ear hook following the natural shape of your ear lobe. This is a departure from how the original Powerbeats Pro fit; they sat closer to the horizontal plane in your ear. If you don't wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly, the heart rate sensor won't be able to get accurate readings.</p><p>Another great thing about the Powerbeats Pro 2 is that it's still equipped with tactile, physical buttons. Each earbuds has a volume rocker at the top and play/pause button on the Beats logo. Again, the play/pause button feels <em>slightly</em> better on the originals — it's bigger and more pronounced — but the difference isn't that big of a deal.</p>

<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is a massive upgrade. It now supports USB-C wired charging and Qi wireless charging. Beyond that, it's smaller, and it's finally pocketable — though you will be left with a bulge and it's still not perfect. In the photo above, you'll see the difference between the Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 2 charging case.</p><p>The new shape of the earbuds makes putting them into the charging case right a bit trickier. However, in my experience, they snap into place perfectly once you find the right spot. This is a big deal, because the original Powerbeats Pro had finicky and sensitive charging contacts, and were notorious for not charging properly.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-hardware-and-sound-quality-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Hardware and sound quality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 refresh is important because, unlike the AirPods Pro/AirPods Pro 2 refresh, the Powerbeats have design <em>and</em> hardware improvements. In fact, just like the Powerbeats Pro and AirPods Pro before it, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are very similar to the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of hardware. Both have an H2 chip for fast-pairing and low-latency connection for Apple products — including ultra-low-latency for Apple Vision Pro. Powerbeats Pro 2 also support one-touch pairing on Android, which the AirPods Pro 2 don't support.</p><p>Powerbeats Pro 2 add support for the ear tip fit test, Spatial Audio, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling (ANC)</a>, transparency mode, and voice isolation — all of which the original Powerbeats Pro does not support. Voice isolation will help clean up input from the Powerbeats Pro 2's six microphones (compared to the Powerbeats Pro's two), but is only available on iOS. As such, Android users will get a bit worse microphone quality than Apple users.</p><p>In terms of audio hardware, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are now equipped with a venting channel to avoid pressure, a high-output amplifier, and axial-aligned transducers. The latter simply means that the transducers are parallel to the acoustic nozzle, which means the sound will go straight into your ear without changing direction. In simple terms, the Powerbeats Pro 2 should sound better than the originals.</p>

<p>In the real world, though, the difference wasn't nearly as noticeable as it might sound. Both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and original Powerbeats Pro could handle music of all genres, with a slight preference to low-frequency sounds. Yes, that means Powerbeats Pro 2 sound excellent while listening to hip-hop/rap/R&B tracks from artists like the Wu-Tang Clan and SZA, but it also means they'll excel at jazz pieces from groups like Booker T. & the M.G.'s.</p><p>You won't want to upgrade from the Powerbeats Pro to the Powerbeats Pro 2 for sound quality alone. The huge differential just isn't there. However, you may want to upgrade for Spatial Audio, ANC, and transparency modes. ANC modes on the Powerbeats Pro feel equivalent to AirPods Pro 2 in terms of their capabilities, which is a huge compliment. I can block out just about any sound I need to, and let it in when necessary.</p><p>Transparency mode will be a game-changer for runners and cyclists. As a long-distance runner who likes to work out outdoors, I rarely wear both Powerbeats Pro earbuds. It just isn't safe. I need to hear cars, bikes, and generally be aware of my surroundings. With Powerbeats Pro 2, I can do that while wearing both earbuds.</p><p>Of course, we can't forget the optical heart rate sensor inside the Powerbeats Pro 2, which are the earbuds' headlining feature. It's essentially a miniature version of the optical sensor inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a>, and compiles readings from each earbud to create a measurement. It records a reading every five seconds, and is comparable to high-end fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> in my testing.</p><p>Heart rate monitoring (HRM) is arguably better on Android than iOS, because it's easier to manually control via the Beats app. It works with almost any device that supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors, including smartwatches. Is it a must-have feature?</p><p>Maybe, maybe not. I won't replace a dedicated fitness watch for Powerbeats Pro 2 anytime soon, but I could see why someone might. For example, certain activities — like weightlifting, core workouts, and yoga — can be difficult with a wearable on the wrist.</p>

<p>Apple improved the battery life of the Powerbeats Pro 2, which helps offset any hit that HRM or ANC would've had. The original Powerbeats Pro could get 9 hours of playback on a single charge, plus an additional 15 hours via the charging case. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can get up to eight hours of playback on a single charge with an ANC mode active, plus an additional 28 hours via the charging case. With Adaptive EQ enabled, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can reach their maximum battery life of 45 hours including the case.</p><p>A quick five-minute charge gives you 1.5 hours of playback on both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and the originals. The Powerbeats Pro 2 charge from 0% to 100% in two hours.</p>

<p>Powerbeats have existed for 15 years now, and went through multiple iterations since they debuted in 2010. Powerbeats Pro 2 are very good workout headphones, but they are a slight departure from the familiar and consistent Powerbeats design and fit. As a result, I'm still fond of the Powerbeats Pro and would consider still using them for certain where perfect fit and stability is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Overall, the Powerbeats Pro 2 show why change is also necessary. The Powerbeats Pro had glaring flaws, from the charging case to the lack of ANC and transparency mode, and the Powerbeats Pro 2 seemingly fixed them all. It's hard to be disappointed when Powerbeats Pro fans got exactly what they wanted. And even if the Powerbeats Pro 2 are slightly less comfortable than their predecessor, they're still ahead of the competition by miles.</p><p>If you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best pair of workout earbuds today</a>, it's probably the Powerbeats Pro 2. They sound excellent, are comfortable, support ANC and transparency mode, and work well with iOS and Android. At $250, I'm absolutely willing to recommend these headphones — especially considering my first-generation pair is still in use after five years.</p><p>But let me tell you this: if you can live with Lightning charging and a bulky case, the original Powerbeats Pro are still a sneaky value buy at their new price of just over $100.</p>

You shouldn't be surprised about this. Disappointed, maybe, but not surprised.</p><p>This highlights something most people aren't thinking about — a company can support a phone for seven years, but it can't make newer features work on older hardware every time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">Seven years of updates</a> doesn't really mean what you think it means.</p>

<p>This is not a bad thing, even if it feels like a bad thing. Samsung explains that many of the AI features depend on what Samsung calls the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a> and that engine isn't supported on older chips; it needs the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> in order to work properly.</p><p>We'll see more of this as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic, or "thinking" AI</a> features, are developed, and you should expect to see some features on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> that will not come to the S25. And that's OK.</p>

<p>You should not buy a phone because you expect something in the future. A phone should do everything it is advertised to do, be mostly bug-free, and be supported to do those things as long as possible. Having seven years of support means your phone will probably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-shows-easily-removable-battery">outlast your battery</a>.</p><p>This isn't a Samsung thing. It's not even an Android thing. We're seeing the exact same from Google with the Pixel series and there will be multiple features that can't be used on the older hardware. The iPhone is the same, with iOS features becoming more hardware-dependent as AI is further integrated into the operating system.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kNeMymzXMniNk2VikMqtqN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Ultra-Galaxy-AI-Agent-YouTube-summary" alt="Galaxy AI creates a summary of a YouTube video on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kNeMymzXMniNk2VikMqtqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love this. You might not, and we can disagree, but knowing that a phone I buy in 2025 will still be supported and perform as expected in 2030 is excellent. I do not expect any new features and the ones that are developed are a bonus. Hopefully, any new features work as they should.</p><p>Phones are at a point where hardware is only a limiting factor when companies leverage those small incremental features they bring. Even more so when a company develops its own chip — either a full SoC package or custom coprocessors — that have a specific use.</p><p>Apple is a great example — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-plus-vs-iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-max">A16 Bionic</a> inside the iPhone 15 is as powerful as the chip that powers a typical laptop. It should be able to handle anything iOS has to offer. It's limited when it comes to AI because Apple dedicated parts of the newer chip to perform these functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Snapdragon or Tensor chip isn't nearly as powerful when it comes to raw processing, but they are more than a CPU, and parts of the chipset are doing very specific things. These parts just aren't inside older phones.</p><p>Forcing new features to work with "inferior" hardware would only make the features worse. Engineers love to develop new stuff and want everyone to use it, and phone makers love to lock new features behind the purchase of a new phone, but the reality is that sometimes there are real reasons why an older model can't do what it needs to do.</p><p>What's really important is that phone manufacturers are beginning to realize (or care) that we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/buying-new-phone-every-year-kind-crazy">don't need to buy a new phone every year</a> or even every two years. Some of us don't want to. I doubt very many people will use the same phone for seven years — even I would upgrade before then — but knowing that you could is awesome.</p><p>Now, we just need every phone maker to get on board and provide customer service as long as Samsung, Google, and Apple do, even if it means some of the new flashy stuff won't be included.</p>

At $299, it's by no means a flagship phone, so I knew very well what I was getting myself into. But while I have plenty of experience with flagships, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> I just reviewed, I always enjoy seeing how phones on the lower end improve.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 is a middle-of-the-road phone for Motorola that leans toward the low-end. That's something to keep in mind when looking at a phone priced just under $300. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, but it <em>does</em> come with a few surprises that we wouldn't have expected to see on such an affordable phone.</p>

<p>Motorola <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">launched</a> the Moto G Power 2025 on January 14, and the phone went on sale on February 6. It can be purchased unlocked directly from Motorola.com or retailers such as Amazon and Best Buy. The phone will also be sold through carriers, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket, AT&T, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Verizon, UScellular, and Consumer Cellular.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 will be available starting at $299, although pricing may vary depending on the retailer or carrier.</p><p>The phone will only come in two colorways: Leaf Green and Slate Gray. Availability of these colors may also depend on the retailer or carrier.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BtkSSHGpDnGenvPRArLHwC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-02" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down in snow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BtkSSHGpDnGenvPRArLHwC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For years, Motorola's phones have had very basic designs, especially the budget Moto G series. The company has been switching that up in recent years, borrowing design cues from its higher-end Edge series like a seamless camera housing and vegan leather finishes. The Moto G Power 2025 is possibly the best-looking Moto G phone I've reviewed, in many ways looking more like a flagship than a $300 phone.</p><p>The phone only comes in two colors but the standout is the Leaf Green (not to be confused with the 2004 Pokémon game of the same name). It's incredibly vibrant, and the soft vegan leather is contrasted by the glossy camera rings, which add a nice flair. The frame of the phone also matches the color and sports a brushed finish. Fingerprints are pretty much non-existent on this phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4132px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-09" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 on the corner of a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYT7P26cQRZdu5PB9su5fF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4132" height="2324" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it's not just good looks that make this phone stand out; it's the build quality. The Moto G Power 2025 is one of the cheapest phones to sport an IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water and dust resistance rating. It may not seem like a huge deal, but this will ensure that the phone can not only handle being submerged but can also withstand high-pressure jets of water. Has anyone ever had their phone accidentally fall into a dishwasher right before they started a cycle? No? Just me? Well, now, that's one less thing you have to worry about.</p><p>I'm not brave enough to test this out myself, but Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich did just that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and it came out unscathed. I'll take his word for it.</p><p>The MIL-STD-810H certification is also a plus, especially since I've recently taken up skiing and tend to keep my phone in my pocket despite still being quite a novice on the slopes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-13" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 face down in snow" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jBeyijbvJ4F5uzc8AHbpME.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4120" height="2317" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola sticks with a Full HD+ LCD panel for the Moto G Power 2025, which is plenty bright and responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. Despite not being the brightest at 1000 nits, I haven't had any trouble viewing the display in any lighting conditions. The bezels are also pretty minimal despite the larger chin and <em>slightly</em> larger forehead.</p><p>The high refresh rate helps make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> feel very smooth when scrolling through apps and pages. There aren't any significant changes with Motorola's version of Android 15 since shifting its software to the new Hello UX with Android 14. It's a fairly clean and simple flavor of Android that doesn't feature too many extra flourishes, although it's dotted here and there with some of Motorola's fixins, like the new dual-panel Control Center/notification pane that more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are adopting.</p><p>Motorola also retains its useful gestures, which continue to be a favorite of mine. Chopping the phone twice turns on the flashlight, twisting twice enables the camera, and a double tap on the back can open apps or perform certain actions. I also love the Sidebar, which can be used to house your frequently used apps, and I think every OEM should have something like this (looking at you, Google).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4083px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="oDCm7e42QwoV7n4nMQSZyB" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-03" alt="The Moto G Power 2025 display outdoors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oDCm7e42QwoV7n4nMQSZyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4083" height="2297" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Performance isn't as big of an issue as one might think. I haven't noticed many problems in this area, but it's important to manage your expectations to some extent. For instance, I can't get away with playing Honkai: Star Rail on its highest settings unless I wanna struggle through poor frame rates and barely functional gameplay. But the phone can surprisingly manage the game at visual settings set to "High" and at 60fps, which is honestly still a great way to play the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll also be happy to know that battery life is quite good. While I would like to see a 6,000mAh battery on the phone with "Power" in the name, the 5,000mAh capacity still gets the phone through a full day of regular use without issue. It's helped by 30W wired charging, which is still faster than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, and 15W wireless charging is a nice thing to have, even if it's not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2</a>.</p><p>Motorola is also doing a better job with its software promise. Previously, the company would offer one OS upgrade with three years of software updates. In 2025, the company is upping that for its budget phones with one additional OS upgrade, meaning the Moto G Power 2025 will support Android 17 when it launches, giving this $300 even more value.</p>

<p>While I mostly enjoy Motorola's flavor of Android, the downside of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> like this is that you're likely to find some level of bloatware. There are quite a few apps preinstalled that I don't want and wasn't given an option to opt out of. They're easy to uninstall, but that's just another step in the setup process that no one wants to deal with.</p><p>The silver lining is that the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">Glance lock screen</a> is disabled by default, although it still lingers in the lock screen settings. However, a new annoyance has seemingly replaced it in the way of the Weather app, powered by 1Weather. It's a pretty busy app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-theres-a-time-and-place-for-ads">filled with ads</a> and the constant ping of weather warnings that I largely don't care about or need. This one you can't uninstall, but you can disable it or turn off the notifications because, honestly, your best bet is to stick with Google's At a Glance widget.</p><p>And while you'll find quite a bit of bloatware, one thing you won't really find is AI. The Moto G Power 2025 is a pretty barebones, straightforward phone with none of the flair you'll find on more expensive models. Likely due to limitations with the chipset, you don't get things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">Magic Canvas</a>, or any of the other cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features. You do get Magic Editor and Magic Compose, although don't expect any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-08" alt="Holding the Moto G Power 2025 and showing the quick settings panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 features a <del>triple</del> dual camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultrawide that doubles as a macro sensor. The cameras are... usable. In good lighting, you can get a decent image, the shutter speed is pretty quick, and I don't hate the selfies taken with the 16MP front-facing camera. However, images are often noisy and lack detail. Lowlight images don't fare very well either.</p><p>One saving grace is the built-in Auto Enhance feature that you can switch on with a tap. It utilizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> to automatically improve images right after they're taken, adjusting colors, lighting, and more. Improvements can be subtle, but they help to make the camera more usable.</p><p>Oh, and there's a third rear sensor, but it's just an ambient light sensor and it doesn't seem to actually be much help here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one feature you'll want to turn <em>off</em> when you set up the Moto G Power 2025 is the RAM Boost. I'm already not a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM solutions</a>, and it's turned on by default on the Power, upping its 8GB to 12GB. While it feels like it should help, the phone felt quite sluggish in my initial use, especially when gaming. It wasn't until I turned off the RAM Boost that performance improved.</p>

<p>There are a fair amount of options for anyone looking for a $300 phone. The Moto G Power 2025 competes with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, which comes from Nothing's budget brand. It comes with a unique design with changeable backplates, a pretty good camera, and an AMOLED display, which isn't very common at this price point. That said, there's no NFC, and if you're in the U.S., network support is fairly spotty.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024">Galaxy A25</a> is also an option. Even though it's last year's model, the A25 comes with an OLED display, a 50MP triple camera system, and an impressive update promise with four OS upgrades and five years of software updates. However, if you're PWM sensitive, you may not find the display very pleasing to use. It also has a dated design with a waterdrop notch, and the Exynos chip can be quite sluggish.</p><p>Finally, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro</a>. This is also a 2024 model featuring an impressive 200MP camera, a sleek design, and great battery life. However, it's held back by hardware limitations, you'll find plenty of bloatware, and you may not wanna hold out for timely updates.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a cheap, no-frills phone.</li><li>You want a phone with great battery life and wireless charging.</li><li>You want a tough phone that will be able to take a beating.</li></ul>

<p>In 2025, AI is the name of the game, but you won't really find that here. For $300, the Moto G Power 2025 is a solid budget phone that can get you through the day without weighing down the experience with a ton of superfluous features. It's for someone who just wants a phone that can do the basics, maybe play some games, and not much else. And honestly, that's great.</p><p>Maybe the camera could be better. Maybe the bloatware can be a little annoying. But these are the concessions you'll have to deal with at this price point, and frankly, the Moto G Power 2025 could be a lot worse. Instead, Motorola seems to be making the best out of what it could get with the Power, improving its software support, giving it flagship-level durability, and making it look better than any other $300 phone on the market.</p><p>Like the Moto G 2025, this phone surprised me, not because of how good it is, but because of how much worse it could be. It's not perfect, but you have to take it for what it is, and that's a pretty good cheap phone.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out an update for the Google TV Streamer with bug fixes.</li><li>The update also brings the Google TV Streamer up to the January 2025 security patch in the Android Security Bulletin.</li><li>It removes Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio as detected audio codecs for the Google TV Streamer.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out the second <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">Google TV Streamer</a> patch update, and the first one of the year, with a few bug fixes and tweaks. The company doesn't explicitly say what is changed in each Google TV Streamer update, but rather lists "bug fixes and performance improvements" in the update's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/7124014?hl=en#zippy=%2Ccurrent-production-firmware-version" target="_blank">official release notes</a>. However, a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1imzoyw/new_update_for_the_google_tv_streamer_rolling_out/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> users have figured out that the latest Google TV Streamer update nixes advanced Dolby audio formats, possibly for good.</p><p>The update carries build number <strong>UTTK.241210.003</strong>, and comes with an update size of 329 MB (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/google-tv-streamer-update-2025/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It also includes bug fixes and security improvements up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-january-2025-security-patch-is-rolling-out-for-a-long-list-of-galaxy-phones">January 2025 patches</a> in the Android Security Bulletin. Interestingly, the official support document lists the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">current production firmware version</a> for the Google TV Streamer as <strong>UTT3.240625.001</strong>, but it'll likely be updated soon.</p><p>In the meantime, users on the Android TV subreddit have identified a few changes introduced with the latest Google TV Streamer update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-removes-audio-formats-3526493/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). It appears to have fixed an issue that caused certain Dolby Atmos outputs to freeze, preventing Dolby Surround from working properly. Additionally, it solves a problem with HDMI-CEC affecting volume control, per user reports. As part of the update, the TV Streamer's Voice Remote was updated to version 1.02.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1imzoyw/new_update_for_the_google_tv_streamer_rolling_out">New update for the Google TV Streamer rolling out</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV">r/AndroidTV</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Crucially, the update removes Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio as detected audio codecs for the Google TV Streamer. It appears to have ended a saga concerning high-fidelity audio on the TV Streamer. While the two Dolby audio formats were originally detectable on the Google TV Streamer, they were never available or functional. However, it was rumored that their mere existence could mean future support was possible.</p><p>With the latest Google TV Streamer update, the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio codecs have been axed entirely. As such, it looks like these formats were never coming to the Google TV Streamer, now that they're no longer showing up as detectable outputs.</p><p>While it may be a bummer for audio fans, the Google TV Streamer still supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital, and Dolby Digital Plus.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim OPPO and OnePlus are developing an Alert Slider replacement that brings more customization for users.</li><li>The new hardware feature could mirror Apple's Action Button, which is introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro.</li><li>The future of OnePlus' foldables is a little bleak as the company confirmed it will not launch the Open 2 in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New rumors are swirling about the direction OPPO and OnePlus may take the next generation of phones.</p><p>The alleged new direction was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PeezJcEjg">posted on Weibo</a> by Digital Chat Station (DCS), which claims both companies could drop the Alert Slider (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/oneplus-alert-slider-button-replacement-report/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states each Chinese OEM is looking to replace the notification-focused button with one that's more "customizable" — and it seems Apple may have influenced this. OPPO and OnePlus are rumored to develop a button similar to the iPhone's Action button.</p><p>The machine-translated post says this button could be called the "Magic Cube Key." This seems more like an internal name, but we'll have to see when/if it happens.</p><p>Additionally, DCS claims the button could let users "mute, customize the flash, screenshot, photo, translation, custom quick launch app" and more. Rumors say this button is aimed at "new phones," which makes us wonder if we'd see it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 14</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Android Central's Andrew Myrick said in 2023 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">OnePlus could implement</a> something similar to Apple's Action button due to its Alert Slider feature. Apple debuted the new button on the iPhone 15 Pro, which replaced the old physical mute button. The replacement still lets users mute audio, but it adds the ability to launch the camera app and the flashlight.</p><p>The button added even more customization by letting users launch their camera app in a specific mode of choice if the Action button is pressed.</p><p>In other news, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">recently confirmed</a> that its foldable successor, the Open 2, will not launch this year. In a blog post, the company's product manager, Vale G, said OnePlus was "recalibrating" its "foldable strategy." As a result, its next-gen foldable will not see its highly anticipated 2025 debut.</p><p>This is interesting considering OPPO and OnePlus typically share hardware specs and designs. However, the former isn't pulling back on its next foldable, the Find N5. That device is still gearing up for a February 20 launch. OnePlus likely needs more time to polish its foldable as Vale G stated, "...we believe this is the right approach for us at this time."</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> temporarily avoided disaster by reaching a temporary deal with Paramount to keeps its channels and properties available on the streaming services. As the two sides negotiated, YouTube TV announced Feb. 12 that Paramount channels might disappear as it was unable to reach what it considered "a fair deal." However, it later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Paramount channels would continue to be available on YouTube TV in the near future as the two sides continue to find a long-term solution.</p><p>"We’ve reached a short term extension as we work toward a deal with Paramount to keep their content on YouTube TV. YouTube TV subscribers continue to have access to Paramount channels, including CBS, and any recordings that are in their Library," the company wrote in the blog post. "We appreciate your patience as we continue to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Paramount's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement."</p><p>It's unclear how long this short-term extension will last. Paramount provides 34 channels on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, including CBS, CBS Sports, MTV, Comedy Central, and regional stations. It also enables extra services, like Paramount Plus with SHOWTIME and BET Plus.</p><p>YouTube TV customers are frustrated by the developments, as the streaming service recently increased prices by $10, from $73 to $83, just one month ago. Additionally, the timing of the rights dispute is unfortunate, with March Madness (the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) and The Masters tournament coming up in March and April — airing on CBS and CBS Sports.</p>

<p>For now, YouTube TV customers can still access Paramount channels, but it's unclear how long that'll last if a true deal isn't reached.

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out an update for the Contacts app that brings more customization and uniqueness to your saves.</li><li>Users will soon find a "Monogram" tab that lets them customize a letter-based or emoji-based profile icon for contacts.</li><li>Google has been slowly working on upgrading its Contacts app by implementing a total redesign and revamped creation page.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly in the early stages of a Contacts app update that lets you set quirky pictures for people you know.</p><p>AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contacts-creative-contact-pictures-3524348/">Android Authority</a>) spotted an update for the Contacts app, which brings a third "Choose Picture" option for saved numbers. Users should soon notice a "Monogram" tab on the far right of the usual "Device Photos" and Google Photos choices. Tapping Monogram lets users edit a letter-based profile icon that mirrors what you'd normally find for saved contacts.</p><p>The core of this addition is the circular profile icon with the (defaulted) letter "A." Users can tap this and customize it by inputting the letter of their choice. Beneath, there's an "Inspire Me" button, which the tipster states will "automatically set the font and background color."</p><p>Within the Monogram tab is a secondary profile option called "Emoji." From here, users can follow the same steps and tap the center to assign an emoji for a saved contact. The emojis offer a little extra as users can choose to have a fully colorized character represent their contact. Think of a full red heart or a bright yellow sun. The second option, titled "Monochrome," changes the tone.</p><p>From the tipster's example, it doesn't turn your contact's icon black and white, instead, it mirrors Android's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-enable-themed-icons-in-android-13">Themed Icons</a>." The emoji loses its color and takes on a light and dark theme per your chosen background.</p><p>The Monogram and Emoji photo options let users decide between six colors and five font styles (monogram only).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.79%;"><img id="B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c" name="google-contacts-monogram-profile-icon-option" alt="Google Contacts' latest update lets users customize their saved contact's profile icon with a monogram letter or an emoji." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="633" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tipster claims the update is rolling out with Google Contacts v4.48.27.720; however, they haven't received it yet. We've checked on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a> and the update isn't available. So, the update is likely slowly making its way onto Android devices as we close the week.</p><p>Google has been working on refreshing the Contacts app for a while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-navigation-update-custom-ringtones">with updates like its total redesign</a> last March. One of the major changes was the removal of the navigational drawer for a dropdown menu, instead. Elsewhere, the primary contact creation page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-less-cluttered-creation-redesign-spotted">was redesigned to be simpler</a>. In short, Google placed the most important aspects of your contact, like their first name, last name, company, and phone number first.</p><p>The redesign gave larger buttons for other, commonly used additions like their email and more under that. Regarding auxiliary options (middle name, suffix, and prefix), Google shoved those into an "add fields" button at the bottom.</p><p>The company was also spotted working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-quicker-video-call-process-tipped">initiating video calls</a> even quicker through Contacts.</p>
