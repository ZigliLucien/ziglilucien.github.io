                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing's phones deservedly get plenty of praise, but I'm more interested in what the brand is doing with its earbuds. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nothing-ear-1-review">ear (1)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-2-review">Ear (2)</a> set a high bar, and the CMF sub-brand is continuing that momentum. I used the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-cmf-buds-amazing-budget">CMF Buds</a> last year and came away thinking they're the best entry-level earbuds around, and with the Buds Pro 2, Nothing is taking things to a whole new level.</p>
<div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Hardwired</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7" name="lloyd-hardwired.png" caption="" alt="Android Central's LLoyd with a bionic eye" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5u6gVPowTCuSQ8NJeoktj7.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/hardwired">Hardwired</a>, AC Senior Editor Harish Jonnalagadda delves into all things hardware, including phones, audio products, storage servers, and routers.</p></div></div>
<p>Just like the CMF Buds, the Buds Pro 2 have a bold design that immediately allows the earbuds to stand out. With most brands still offering the usual black or white variants, Nothing's bright orange and blue hues are designed to grab attention. <br><br>The rest of the design is thought out well; the case is easily pocketable, and it holds the buds securely. I like the dial on the case, and what's particularly cool is that it acts as a control surface. The dial can be used to control music playback and adjust volume, and that's just plain cool — I don't know why other brands don't do this. <br><br>I also like the design of the earbuds; there's a glossy coat on the shell, but the stalk has a matte texture, and that makes it easier to use gesture controls, and minimizes smudges. The lightweight design ensures the buds are comfortable even with extended listening sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5BFojqY8bzm5iL5XSNkBHT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 buds next to case with smart dial button highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5BFojqY8bzm5iL5XSNkBHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good connectivity as well, and like the rest of Nothing's earbuds, the Buds Pro 2 are configurable via Nothing X. You can customize the sound, adjust gesture controls, and toggle spatial audio — I didn't see any issues connecting to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p><p>But it's the sound that truly differentiates the Buds Pro 2 from other products in this category. You get a 11mm driver in addition to a 6mm tweeter, and Nothing did a fantastic job tuning the buds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 buds and case next to Vivo X200 Pro set to equalizer mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BktLAxCYMCge6bmvGz8MHT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In short, these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and the sound quality is equivalent to products that cost thrice as much. Creative's Zen Air are the only other earbuds I used recently that measure up to the Buds Pro 2, and while they nail the technicalities, Nothing's earbuds have a more dynamic and engaging sound. <br><br>There's an Ultra Bass mode if you need a little bit extra in the low-end, and it does a great job adding energy to the mix. While there's no 10-band EQ, you can tweak the bass, mid, and treble in the Custom sound mode, and that's more than what you get with most earbuds. I'm partial to the Dirac mode; this automatically optimizes the sound, and it lends itself well to diverse genres.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bMLJ2mgefuNepzPeeSMsJT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 next to CMF Buds Pro and Vivo X200 Pro showcasing Ultra Bass mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMLJ2mgefuNepzPeeSMsJT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's good noise isolation as well, and while it isn't as effective as costlier earbuds, it manages to tune out low-frequency ambient sound, and that should be adequate to most users eyeing these buds. You get other extras as well, including Google Fast Pair, IP55 ingress protection, ability to connect to two devices at once, in-ear detection, and a low-latency mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UyRuuFevJJKMkoMuiYafFT" name="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2" alt="Nothing CMF Buds Pro 2 next to CMF Buds Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UyRuuFevJJKMkoMuiYafFT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another interesting inclusion is spatial sound; the Buds Pro 2 project a wide sound, and it makes a difference. While it's an admirable effort, if you want the best virtual surround sound, you'll need to get Creative's Zen Air — they're better than anything else in the category.</p><p>I don't really have any negatives; the design is distinctive, the fit is great and doesn't cause any fatigue, you get a lot of useful extras, and the sound is the best in this category. Honestly, you don't get anything that's as good in the vicinity of $50.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I've always enjoyed using Vivo's X series devices, but it wasn't until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x90-pro-long-term-review">X90 Pro</a> that the brand really started showcasing what it can do on the imaging side of things. Vivo turned that up a notch earlier this year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-pro-review">X100 Pro</a>; the phone continues to have one of the best camera packages around, and it's only bested by the China-exclusive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> — no small feat. <br><br>While the X100 Ultra is the best phone camera I've ever used, the fact that it isn't available globally makes it a non-starter. Thankfully, Vivo is addressing that with the introduction of the X200 Pro. The phone has the same 200MP telephoto lens as the Ultra, and it also takes magnificent portrait shots. You get a new 50MP main camera, and while it doesn't have a 1-inch sensor like the X100 Pro or Ultra, it takes standout photos and videos in challenging scenarios. <br><br>Honestly, that's all you need to know about the X200 Pro — it brings the best features of the X100 Ultra to a global audience, and takes photos of the same caliber. That alone makes the phone immediately worthy of consideration, and you get plenty of other extras, including a new design, brighter AMOLED panel, more efficient MediaTek hardware, a much bigger 6000mAh silicon battery, and IP69 ingress protection. <br><br>I used the global model of the X200 Pro for a week, and here's why I think this is the camera phone to beat in 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4mf8Dmh9WsQWaZunAiEZoT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo unveiled the X200, X200 Pro, and X200 Pro mini in China in October 2024, and the phones made their global debut on December 12 in India. Vivo isn't bringing the X200 Pro mini outside China, but the X200 and X200 Pro are available in global markets, starting with select regions in Asia over the coming weeks. <br><br>I got used to the 1TB model of the X100 Ultra, but Vivo isn't bringing that storage variant to global markets; the X200 Pro is instead sold in a single 16GB/512GB configuration outside China. This 16GB/512GB variant is now available in India for ₹94,999 ($1,120). The standard X200 is also on sale in the country at ₹65,999 ($778) for the 12GB/256GB configuration, and Vivo has an additional 16GB/512GB model that costs ₹71,999 ($849).</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-design"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zmrmHGBeMyDctgucrEd6uT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most Android manufacturers have switched to iPhone-esque designs, and Vivo isn't immune to the trend either. The X200 Pro has a distinctly boxier design with flat sides, and it doesn't look as elegant as the X100 Pro. While I still prefer devices with smooth curves, I will admit that Vivo did a good job with the design; the phone is much more comfortable to hold than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vBwYCNCLpfvTvk9zeSiWfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Predictably, the camera island dominates attention at the back; Vivo has steadily increased the size of the housing over the last three years as it slotted in bigger camera sensors, and the module on the X200 Pro stretches nearly across the width of the device. I would have liked the interior of the housing to have the same color as the back — like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> — but Vivo went with a standard black design. That said, the ring encircling the camera housing differentiates the design a little bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera module highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the Titanium variant of the device, and it feels great to hold and use. The dull grey sheen makes the device look understated, and the back glass has a satin texture that's much better than the usual glossy finishes, and it minimizes smudges. The sides are made out of aluminum, with Vivo mimicking the feel of titanium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro with Vivo logo at the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y6UWk6ckM6nqtueygwzfrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is cleaner than previous years, with Vivo eschewing the various taglines and metal-etched accouterments it added on the X90 Pro and X100 Pro. The overall aesthetic feels mature, and while the grey model doesn't attract attention as much, the blue option is the way to go if you want a color that stands out.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Vivo put the ultrasound fingerprint module higher up this time around, and I didn't run into any issues accessing it. While I prefer optical modules, Vivo is using a Goodix sensor that's among the best around; it's fast to authenticate, and doesn't have any problems with oily or wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro design showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/trn69VauRJhoReoogNAZfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Coming in at 228g, the X200 Pro is one of the heaviest phones I used recently, as well as the biggest; that said, Vivo did a great job with the weight distribution, and even though it has massive cameras at the back, it doesn't feel unwieldy in the least. I now put cases on phones that have flat sides as I don't like the in-hand feel, but I didn't have to do so on the X200 Pro; although it has a flatter design, the beveled edges and subtle curves at the back where it meets the mid-frame make it much easier to hold and use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMmAYUGcUJyNLiCxQGHTfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The power and volume buttons have better tactility than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Find X8 Pro, and the rest of the ports are standard: you get a dual-SIM tray, IR blaster, and dual stereo sound. The X200 Pro picks up IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, giving it added resilience against water jets. While I didn't test that yet, the phone fell into a bowl of chutney and came away unscathed, and that's good enough for my use case (I eat a lot of chutney).</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kiKVeCohBuJreWwPa2zpuT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro retains the 6.78-inch size as its predecessor, and you get the same 2800 x 1260 resolution. What's different this time is the brightness; it manages to hit 4500 nits in HDR content, and there's an easily noticeable difference in daily use as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro selfie camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ayNsVNG2p8o9qeBJJynXrT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What's particularly great is that the X200 Pro got just as bright as the X100 Ultra in outdoor use, and in my testing, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL managed to outmatch the device. It does a much better job in this area than the X100 Pro, and it's evident when using the phones next to each other. You get the usual LTPO tech, and the phone gets 2160Hz PWM dimming at all brightness levels, giving it a distinct edge over Google and Samsung phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro video in YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v6CPAGwzkTgvsEn4UHFdwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While it doesn't have anywhere close to the same curvature as previous models, the panel has a very subtle curve around the sides that makes it a little better to use. Colors and contrast levels are excellent out of the box, and like all high-end phones, you get a great range of customizability in tweaking the color balance. Vivo has useful eye protection features as well, including an anti-fatigue mode and automatic blue light filter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro backgrounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/S8kQMqrrMfvghECSaMh8xT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a decent selection of always-on styles too, and the phone has a smooth transition from the lock screen to the home screen, which is something you'll see on ColorOS as well. I didn't have any issues streaming HDR content on the phone, and after a dozen hours of gaming, there were no problems in this regard either. The onboard sound is better than the X100 Pro, and you get a good stereo effect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro coating" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uo8jY8eD2r9fYBb2HYmucT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only issue with the panel is that the oleophobic coating is starting to wear out after just a week of use; my daily usage hasn't differed, but the top edge has a visible line where there's no coating, and that's troublesome. By contrast, the X100 Pro has been in regular use throughout 2024, and it doesn't have any issues with the coating. I saw a similar occurrence on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> too, and I'll provide an update once either brand confirms what the problem might be — it could just be the coating that was used on these two devices.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro about device section" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwD9p9SHjjW8aZPwcxnetT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the X100 Ultra switched to Qualcomm hardware, Vivo is clearly intent on using MediaTek's Dimensity on the rest of the X100 series, and that's a good decision. The X200 Pro uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-dimensity-9400-is-the-biggest-challenger-to-qualcomm-yet">Dimensity 9400</a> — same as the Find X8 Pro — and it is fantastic in daily use. I didn't see any slowdowns or lag, and it handled gaming without breaking a sweat. <br><br>The phone tends to get a little hotter than the Find X8 Pro, but just by two degrees Celsius. The stability score of 49% in 3DMark's Steel Nomad Light test is on the lower end of the scale, but thankfully, you won't see any jitter even in demanding games, and while it throttles in extended gaming sessions, it still delivers steady framerates. With 16GB of RAM and 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage onboard, you don't have to worry about multitasking or storage issues.</p>

<p>Given that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13</a> also runs Funtouch OS and is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite instead, we can see how the two devices differ. Obviously, there's no difference between the two in regular use, but the iQOO 13 holds up a little better in gaming — it doesn't throttle as early. Other than that, you get a similar level of performance. <br><br>I didn't see any issues with cellular connectivity, but calls were garbled at times; I'm not sure if this was down to where I was at the time or the cellular signal, but I don't usually run into this problem, so thought to highlight it. There's the usual LDAC and LHDC codecs in addition to AptX HD, and you get dual-band GPS, NFC, and a USB-C port based on the USB 3.2 standard. <br><br>The new vibration motor has exquisite feedback, and it makes using the device that much more engaging. Overall, there isn't much amiss with the X200 Pro in this area, and it is has one of the best hardware packages around.</p>

<p>Like most other 2025 flagships, the X200 Pro picks up a huge battery, with Vivo slotting in a 6000mAh unit inside the device. It also uses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon tech</a> to deliver better density, and the increased size along with better efficiency allows it to last two days. Even with heavy use, I only had to charge the phone every other day, and it's liberating. <br><br>There's no battery anxiety whatsoever with the device, and when you need to plug it in, the X200 Pro uses Vivo's 90W charging standard, and the requisite charger is bundled in the package. It takes just under 50 minutes to charge the battery, and it's on par with the best phones in this area.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-cameras"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Cameras</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera housing highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gcv2r2ED7YPJ5NVCxBfPfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X200 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony Lytia-818 imaging sensor with a 1/1.28-inch sensor, and while it isn't as big as the 1-inch sensor on the X100 Pro, it does a great job in its own right. The highlight is the inclusion of the 200MP Samsung HP9 telephoto lens, which is the same one used in the X100 Ultra to great effect. The wide-angle lens is a 50MP Samsung JN1, which is unchanged from last year, as is the 32MP front module.<br> <br>Vivo uses a custom V3+ imaging module in conjunction with the Dimensity 9400, and this allows the brand to eke out better detail with HDR video. The X200 Pro has 4K60 Dolby Vision video out of all the sensors and focal lengths at the back, and the phone does a standout job with video in general. There's portrait video, 10-bit LOG, and a street mode that adds a noticeable vignette to resultant shots. <br><br>The camera interface itself hasn't changed, and you get a decent number of shooting modes and filters. Vivo's collaboration with Zeiss is evident in the portrait shots and tonal balance of the photos, and you can pick between three styles: Vivid, Textured, and Zeiss Natural. The Vivid mode has the best colors, and that's the one I used as default when testing the X200 Pro.</p>

<p>As you'd imagine, there are no issues with photos taken in daylight conditions. The X200 Pro does a great job preserving detail, and you get vibrant colors with excellent dynamic range and white balance. While the sensor itself isn't as large as last year, tweaks to the tuning allows the X200 Pro to deliver a similar caliber of photos. <br><br>The main camera does an incredible job in low-light conditions as well, delivering accurate colors and details. Honestly, I don't have anything to fault with the main camera, and the X200 Pro delivers everything I need — photo quality is always consistent, it does a good job with fast-moving objects, and there's no shutter lag whatsoever. <br><br>The biggest change this time is the 200MP telephoto lens; it goes up to 3.7x via optical zoom and has OIS, and while the increased focal length is obviously useful, where the lens truly shines is at portrait shots. The X200 Pro takes delightful portrait shots, with class-leading segmentation and bokeh. The best part about the mode is that you get to choose between five focal lengths, giving you plenty of options to frame a subject. <br><br>Although the wide-angle lens is an older sensor, it does a decent enough job most of the time. It's only in demanding low-light scenarios that you can make out its limitations, but in all other shooting conditions, it delivers usable photos. The only quibble I have in this area is that the selfie lens isn't quite up to scratch. It's still a decent module and takes good photos, but it doesn't have the same quality as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Vivo should have switched to a newer sensor. <br><br>Outside of that, the X200 Pro has what is arguably one of the strongest camera packages, and the combination of the 50MP main lens and versatile zoom lens gives it a distinct advantage. I'm intrigued to see what Vivo does with the X200 Ultra, because barring that, I don't see any other device outmatching the X200 Pro in 2025.</p>

<p>I like what Vivo is doing on the software side of things. The X200 Pro runs Funtouch OS 15 based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, and it is different enough to ColorOS 15 and its derivatives that you don't feel like you're using the same UI. The interface is clean and optimized incredibly well to take advantage of the hardware, and I now prefer it to ColorOS or MIUI — a big deal considering its iOS-esque heritage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro notification shade with music on YouTube Music" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NoLWsGEddpL22HUzmHHarT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't have any negatives in this area; I didn't see any problems with push notifications or errant crashes, and the UI was fluid in the week I used the device. That's just with this device; as mentioned earlier, I used the X100 Pro as a secondary phone for much of 2024, and didn't run into any issues there either.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro widgets page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/87ittmsMrz5jmAXkQucArT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like every other interface, you get a decent amount of AI-backed utilities, including Circle to Search, AI note summarization, transcribing, and translation. Whether they're actually usable is down to your needs; I don't see the point of most AI tools in their current state, and the only one I use with any regularity is the transcribe feature that lets me convert audio to text.</p>
<p>Vivo does a good job with software updates, and the X100 Pro picked up consistent updates over the course of the year. The X200 Pro will receive four Android OS updates along with six years of security updates, and while that's not on par with Google and Samsung, it is in line with what other Chinese manufacturers are doing.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-the-competition"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: The competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Ultra and X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X8 Pro is the closest rival to the X200 Pro, with both phones featuring the same MediaTek Dimensity platform and delivering standout cameras. With the X200 Pro confined to Asian markets, the Find X8 Pro is a viable choice if you need a device with versatile cameras. While Vivo's phone has the edge at portrait shots and zoom, the Find X8 Pro does a great job on its own. I like Vivo's color tuning better, and Funtouch OS is better to use than the most recent iteration of ColorOS, so the X200 Pro wins out.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x200-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Vivo X200 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MYQLUwMgzqLKooaTqSkDtT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MYQLUwMgzqLKooaTqSkDtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need one of the best camera packages available today</li><li>You want a fantastic telephoto lens</li><li>You need a phone that takes stunning portrait shots</li><li>You want class-leading battery life</li><li>You need the latest hardware</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best selfie camera</li><li>You want long-term updates similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL</li><li>You need a device that's sold in the U.S. or U.K.</li></ul>
<p>Vivo didn't need to change too many things with the X100 Pro, and thankfully, the brand retained the best features from the device. The X200 Pro has one of the best camera packages you'll find today, and the addition of the 200MP telephoto lens gives it a distinct advantage. The portrait shots you get out of the phone are truly incredible, and while the X100 Ultra still has a slender edge, it isn't much. <br><br>I like everything else about the phone. The AMOLED panel is among the best I've used, the hardware is on par with the best from Qualcomm, and the battery lasts two days between charges. The software is great to use as well, and Funtouch OS 15 delivers a good balance between a fluid UI and plenty of customizability. <br><br>The only point of contention is that the selfie camera isn't quite on the same level as other flagships. And with the phone limited to Asian countries, there's no reliable way to get a hold of it in the U.S. or U.K., and that's a real shame. But if you're in a country where the device is sold by Vivo, you should consider picking it up. <br><br>Having used the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Find X8 Pro in the last three months, I'm convinced that the X200 Pro has the best cameras of the lot, and my SIM is staying put in this device long after the review is done.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp detailed a series of updates for its voice and video calling services.</li><li>Those calling on the web-based app will find a more convenient and easy to use UI when calling alongside better controls in group chats.</li><li>WhatsApp recently rolled out "Message Drafts" to mobile users alongside Transcripts for voice messages.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp is detailing several new calling features that users will soon find on mobile and the web-based app.</p><p>The Meta-owned communication service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/improved-calling-this-holiday-season">highlighted</a> the series of updates that will soon hit devices. The updates kick off with the web-based WhatsApp version as the post states users there will find "improved calling." It seems the service is updating the UI experience as it says users calling someone else will find the call button, call link creation, and the ability to dial a number directly more conveniently.</p><p>Selecting call participants is also receiving a bit of holiday cheer as WhatsApp rolls in better control when it groups. According to the post, users can now call specific people within a group chat, instead of ringing everyone simultaneously.</p><p>Video calling is the final area WhatsApp's December update hones in on, beginning with "better quality." The company states calls are "more reliable" and users can enjoy a "higher resolution with a clearer picture" during one-on-one and group video calls.</p><p>This update is rolling out for mobile and desktop users.</p><p>Lastly, the platform detailed additional video call effects. The announcement states users will find 10 new effects, ranging from cute dog ears and nose to an underwater theme and a microphone for singing.</p><p>Users should begin noticing these updates today (Dec 12) and beyond as we end the week. Continue to check to see if your app has an update if you've not seen one yet.</p>

<p>WhatsApp deployed a new update in November that was like the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-whatsapp-message-drafts-rollout">missing piece</a>" for its services: message drafts. These new draft indicators were designed for mobile devices. When writing a text in a one-on-one thread or group chat, and you haven't sent it, users will notice a "draft" label in your messaging list. Places where you started, but didn't finish will be bumped to the top of your list for visibility.</p><p>This is a feature that's been commonly seen in other apps like Google Messages and it's good that WhatsApp is finally onboard.</p><p>Additionally, the platform rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-introduces-voice-message-transcripts">an accessibility update</a> that concerns Voice Messages. "Select" languages started receiving support for Transcripts when receiving a voice message. These transcriptions are said to work with longer audio files and will remain there to return and read later on. WhatsApp adds that the transcriptions are optional and users can turn them off via the settings if desired.</p>

<hr>
<p>Epic Games, creators of Fortnite, have announced a major partnership that will bring its games to "millions" of users.</p><p>Today (Dec 12), Epic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/telefonica-and-epic-games-bring-fortnite-and-the-epic-games-store-to-telefonica-devices">detailed its new partnership</a> with Telefónica, a global cellular carrier with strong ties to areas within Europe. Epic states this is the beginning of a "long term" partnership with the service provider as its Game Store will be pre-loaded onto every Android phone it offers consumers.</p><p>Telefónica's Director of Partnerships and Devices, Lorena Itziar Senador-Gómez Lázaro stated, "with this collaboration with Epic Games we strengthen our relationship and go one step further in delivering high-quality, accessible, and innovative digital experiences to our customers."</p><p>Epic calls this a "strategic alliance" as it looks to create a more "competitive ecosystem for Android players." Its statement adds that consumers will now be exposed to more choices beyond the "conventional app marketplaces."</p><p>While Telefónica is quite widespread across Europe, Epic states its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/EpicNewsroom/status/1867152588094771446">pre-loaded app store will concern</a> Spain, the U.K., Germany, Mexico, and Spanish-speaking LATAM on its network.</p><p>Several of the games Android users leveraging Telefónica's cell service will find are Fortnite, Fall Guys, and Rocket League Sideswipe.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Epic Games Store will now be preinstalled on Telefónica Android devices in Spain, UK, Germany, Mexico and Spanish-speaking Latam. This will enable players to bypass many of Google’s misleading scare screens and get to playing Fortnite faster. We’re looking to partner with…<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867152588094771446">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The companies are reportedly not content with stopping here as 2025 will hold additional ventures into expanded partnerships. Epic and Telefónica will seek to "bring more benefits" to its Android players across its cellular network.</p><p>What's interesting about this new pre-load partnership with Telefónica is that Epic tried to do this with OnePlus and LG, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-stopped-oneplus-pre-installing-fortnite-its-phones">Google stopped it</a>. Google was reportedly afraid that Epic would "install and update multiple games with a silent install bypassing the Google Play Store."</p><p>When Epic highlights "conventional app marketplaces," we can't help but look to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/now-google-has-removed-fortnite-its-play-store">storied history with Google</a>. Epic sued Google in 2020 after its popular game, Fortnite, was axed from the Play Store after an update gave players a way to buy its virtual currency, V-Bucks, directly through the developer.

Epic has continued to fight tech companies — think Google and Samsung — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/epic-sues-google-and-samsung-anti-competitive-case">over anti-competitive practices</a> when it comes to third-party developers.</p><p>Where we're at now is the Epic Game Store's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/epic-games-store-arriving-on-android-later-this-year">arrival for download</a> on Android. Epic is more interested in delivering a "fair" experience for games and developers, instead of being content with Google's large 15% to 30% fee during transactions. Moreover, Epic stated it would keep the same 88/12 split for purchases that it has on its PC client. Developers would retain 88% of a user's purchase, with the remaining 12% falling into Epic's hands.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim that Samsung could shift to using its Exynos chipset "significantly" inside the Galaxy S26 series.</li><li>Little information is known about the chip; however, previous reports suggest it could be based on Samsung's new 2nm process.</li><li>This rumored followed quickly behind another report that suggests Samsung's Galaxy S25 series could see a sporadic price increase globally.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As we approach the Galaxy S25 series, rumors have surfaced about Samsung's next-generation would-be successor in 2026.</p><p>A new rumor by X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1867062057813807362">Jukanlosreve</a> states that Samsung might bring its Galaxy S26 series in-house for its desired SoC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-could-double-down-on-exynos/">Android Police</a>). According to the post, the Korean OEM is allegedly planning to use its custom Exynos chips "significantly" within the Galaxy S26 flagship series.</p><p>Little else is known about the chip's specifics; however, there is speculation about where it could be applied. The publication suggests Samsung could utilize its Exynos chip in various regions around the world, but stick to Qualcomm for the U.S. market. If true, then it would be similar to what Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-exynos-will-be-just-fine">done in the past</a> with the S24 series.</p><p>That series saw the Exynos applied to markets in Europe, India, and the U.K.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung aims to “significantly” equip the Galaxy S26 with Exynos chips next year.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867062057813807362">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>We might have an idea about this alleged Exynos focus as there was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-starts-work-on-its-2nm-process-chip">a report in May</a> from a South Korean news outlet. The post alleged that Samsung was preparing to develop a stronger, 2nm process for the eventual Exynos 2600 SoC. The SoC supposedly had the codename "Thetis" internally. The report claimed that Samsung was planning on popping the chip into the Galaxy S26 series.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">confirmed</a> it was planning on mass producing a 2mn process chip in 2025, an area where it wanted to take the lead.</p><p>Early reports purported that the chip would deliver a 12% increase in performance, a 25% efficiency boost, and a 5% decrease in "total area."</p><p>A more exclusive shift toward an in-house chip could help Samsung keep its costs in a (somewhat) comfortable light — especially following <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">a new report</a>. It was recently rumored that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series, which will use Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-chip">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, could see a "slight" price jump in South Korea. This was reportedly due to a higher exchange rate between the two companies for the product.</p><p>It was stated that Qualcomm's tech had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">risen by roughly 30%</a> compared to previous generations and it could impact regions sporadically. A price hike has been rumored since September, as it was purported that the latest flagship chip leaped by ~$190 for OEMs.</p><p>Early rumors regarding the Galaxy S26 can always change, so take this with a grain of salt. For now, we have the S25 series to look ahead to during its likely launch in January 2025. What's more, a recent claimed the series could boast <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-qi2-wireless-charging-support-rumors">Qi2 wireless charging</a> support.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid ongoing FBI investigations into a massive cyberespionage campaign, experts are urging Canadian iPhone and Android users to hit pause on texting between these platforms.</p><p>Last week, a Chinese hacking group known as "Salt Typhoon" reportedly stole tons of Americans' metadata, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/large-number-americans-metadata-stolen-by-chinese-hackers-senior-official-says-2024-12-04/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. In response, the FBI is urging people to stick to encrypted messaging and calls instead of texting.</p><p>While messaging within the same platform is fairly secure, texts between Android and iPhone are vulnerable to attacks, as shown by recent hacks linked to "Salt Typhoon," which is reportedly tied to the Ministry of Public Security.</p><p>The hack reportedly hit at least eight U.S. telecoms, giving Beijing officials access to private texts and calls from who knows how many Americans. The Salt Typhoon hack is said to be behind the attack on companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen Technologies.</p><p>FBI officials say the attacks stole tons of call and text metadata, but not the content. Only a small group of individuals, mainly tied to government or political work, had their private messages compromised.</p><p>These attacks have exposed major security flaws in U.S. communication networks, which are vulnerable to interception since end-to-end encryption isn't standard. That's why companies like Apple and Google recommend using encryption, making <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">messaging apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> and Telegram more popular than ever.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/canadian-iphone-and-android-users-should-stop-texting-each-other-experts-advise-as-fbi-investigates/article_633d58de-b62b-11ef-8949-4b239047f867.html" target="_blank">Toronto Star</a> reports that Canada’s Communications Security Establishment says it hasn't found any Canadian networks affected yet.</p><p>Experts still think it's "highly likely" Canadian systems have been targeted too. Even without the current attacks in mind, they suggest skipping texts between iPhones and Androids for safety.</p><p>FBI officials also recommend U.S. citizens use phones that get regular OS updates, have solid encryption, and enable phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication for email, social media, and collaboration apps.</p>

<p>A speculative Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16 analysis gives you a better view of which phone is right for you. Whether you're more of a Samsung or Apple fan might tip the scale in one direction when choosing between the two phones. But since the Samsung Galaxy S25 specs are not official yet, we're going to have some fun daydreaming about which phone is better using the available rumors for the upcoming Galaxy phone.</p><p>One rumor we love is about the more powerful processor on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">Android phone</a>. The new processor helps Samsung make its new lineup more appealing. The Galaxy S24 is a great option if you don't feel like waiting, but remember that good things come to those who wait.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1408px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-angled-side-early-alleged-rendering.jpeg" alt="Another alleged angled rendering of the Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSTZrT4GF3toZ8EVFwdWhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1408" height="792" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung has kept its design similar over the years, so it's safe to assume that the Galaxy S25 might also have the typical triple camera stack we expect from Android phones. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-leaked-renders-reveal-flat-design" target="_blank">leaked renders</a>, Samsung will fully unify the design across all three models. The Galaxy S25 might have a similar look to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Rumors suggest the Samsung Galaxy S25 will have a more traditional camera lens with ribbed edges and thicker borders. We're optimistic about the Galaxy S25's design and it having the triple camera design we're used to seeing on Samsung phones.</p>
<p>Rumors also suggest that the Galaxy S25 could have the same colors as the earlier model. The Galaxy S25 could be smaller than the iPhone 16 since the rumored size is 146.94 x 70.46 x 7.25mm. The weight is not available, but since the past three models have a weight of 167 and 168 grams, it's safe to assume that the S25 also follows that pattern. Samsung has not confirmed the IP rating, but the Galaxy S24 rating suggests that the S25 will likely have the same.</p><p>The rumored colors for the upcoming Galaxy S25 include Titanium Black, Gray, Blue, and Silver. There are also rumored thinner bezels users could enjoy in 2025.</p><p>On the other hand, the iPhone 16 only has two cameras stacked on the back of the phone's compact design. It also has a new camera bump, leaving behind the square with offset cameras and going for a more vertical arrangement. It has a revamped ultra-wide camera with autofocus, an action key, and a new hardware button for the cameras.</p><p>This year's iPhone 16 retains the same weight and dimension as last year's model, which is 147.6 x 71.6 x 7.8mm and weighs 170 grams. The iPhone is available in White, Black, Pink, Teal, and Ultramarine. You also get a phone with an IP68 rating, but it's still a good idea to dry it off if the phone ever gets wet. However, avoid spilling harmful liquids such as sugary drinks and cleaning liquids.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has the same aluminum frame as Apple's Ceramic Shield as the iPhone 16 Plus. It also has a frame and glass panel with a matte finish that should help with the grip.</p>

<p>Rumors suggest that Samsung could replace its camera hardware with Sony. The processor may be the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset (essentially a rebranded Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip). The Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, with its Oryon cores, will give the S25 a performance jump. However, other rumors indicate that Samsung is saving the Snapdragon processor for the Ultra model and might give the remaining models an Exynos chip.</p><p>According to tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1837452794909086073" target="_blank">Ice Universe</a>, the Galaxy S25 will have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-triple-camera-array-rumors" target="_blank">identical camera setup to the S24</a> model. The camera system could have a 50MP wide primary camera, 10MP telephoto, 12MP selfie, and 12MP ultrawide. The rumored increase in RAM will significantly help if the rumors are true.</p><p>Samsung has held its Unpacked event in January for the last two years, so we might get the official specs shortly. However, if the S25 matches the S24’s specs, we're looking at storage options of 128GB and 256GB and a 4,000mAh battery. On the other hand, other leaks point to a more powerful 5,000mAh battery, sweet! There is also support for wired and wireless charging.</p><p>On the Apple side, the iPhone 16 has Apple's A18 processor, but the upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite may not be too far behind in terms of performance. This is very interesting since it's the first time a Snapdragon chip has matched an Apple one, and we're eager to see how the S25 performs against the iPhone 16.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 48MP main, a 12MP selfie, and a 12MP ultrawide. In addition to that camera power, it has dual-LED dual-tone flash, HDR, and the ability to record in 4K. Beyond its cameras, you can choose from 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB, but it has only 8GB of RAM across all three options. If you're OK with a standard battery, the iPhone 16's 3,561mAh battery should suffice.</p>

<p>There is usually not much of a difference in screen size between models, but according to yeux122 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.blog.naver.com/PostView.naver?blogId=yeux1122&logNo=223385894570&navType=by" target="_blank">Naver</a>, Samsung may increase the display size to 6.3 inches. The Galaxy S25 may also have the same low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) OLED using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/DSCCRoss/status/1849655264984826017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1849655264984826017%7Ctwgr%5E42e6327bee39bb711c19c964e7f951ab539d0ade%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gadgets360.com%2Fmobiles%2Fnews%2Fsamsung-25-ultra-plus-display-technology-costs-report-6878388" target="_blank">M13 organic materials</a> as the S24. I hope that the S25 at least has the same sharp display and 120Hz as the S24, along with the Gorilla Glass Victus 2. Rumors also suggest we could be looking at a 2,600-nit brightness level.</p><p>The iPhone 16 has a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED HDR10 display with Dolby Vision, delivering great visuals with a resolution of 1179 x 2556 and a density of 460ppi. Apple protects the display with Ceramic Shield Glass, which the company claims is twice as strong as Corning Gorilla Glass Victus. Furthermore, a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating keeps the screen smudge-free, also on the iPhone 15. If you like scrolling at night, lowering the brightness to a single nit is fantastic.</p><p>Apple also equipped the iPhone 16 static panels at 60Hz, but it does not support always-on functionality. The display can reach a peak brightness of 2,000 nits.</p>

You can switch between light and dark mode, rearrange the quick controls, and more.</p><p>The first batch of Apple Intelligence is available now, with more to come.

<p>Regarding the Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. iPhone 16, which phone you choose depends on whether you prefer the Samsung or Apple ecosystem. However, delaying your decision is a good idea since Samsung has not officially launched the Galaxy S25. Samsung will hopefully release the Android phone soon, but like with every new launch, the phone will likely come with a high price tag.</p><p>Think of it this way: if you wait, you will have more information to help you decide, and the following batches of Apple Intelligence might be out, as well as the official specs for the S25, including the much-anticipated Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. Taking into consideration that Samsung doesn't save it exclusively for the Ultra version.</p><p>You can choose from available specs when you buy the phone and not go on the promise of what it might have. The iPhone 16 has the A18 processor, but we don't know how it will match up against the S25's processor, whichever one it gets.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube TV announced another price hike today (Dec 12), which will see its Basic Plan rise by $10 to $82.99.</li><li>The platform states this will go into effect on December 12, 2024 for new members before hitting "most" existing users on January 13, 2025.</li><li>YouTube TV states this rise in costs is due to "rising content costs," a similar reason given during its previous hike in 2023.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube TV made an announcement today (Dec 12) confirming pricing changes, despite claiming the opposite after an "erroneous" ad.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/YouTubeTV/status/1867236661173612567">a thread on X</a>, YouTube TV explained its mindset and why it has dropped <em>another </em>price hike here in December. In a "message for our members," the streaming service states that it will increase its monthly cost to $82.99 in light of "rising content costs."</p><p>The service <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/answer/9285852">published a support page</a> to explain the entire scope of this price hike.</p><p>According to YouTube TV, this updated $82.99 price will affect those purchasing the Basic Plan. The change has occurred today (Dec 12) for all new members. However, "most" existing users will see this change go into effect for their accounts on January 13, 2025. In short, this is a $10 hike from the Basic Plan's former $72.99 charge.</p><p>Another detail to know is that anyone whose membership is paused will see this new price once you've reactivated it. Additionally, if you've received YouTube TV's Basic Plan via a promotional trial or price, the post states this new price will be attached once the promotion expires. Those who've purchased the Basic Plan through a YouTube TV Integrated Billing partner will see this new price applied to their account on February 13, 2025.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message for our members: we have always worked to offer the content you love, with features to enjoy the best of live TV. To keep up with rising content costs, we’re updating our monthly price to $82.99/mo. (1/3)<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1867236661173612567">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>YouTube TV adds that it didn't make this decision "lightly" and states that it may "impact" its users. While the price is set to rise in a month, the post adds that those sticking with the Basic Plan won't lose any content. The Basic Plan will continue to feature 100 plus channels, unlimited storage DVR, six accounts per household, and more.</p><p>What's strange about this announcement is that YouTube TV denied any sort of price increase on Monday (Dec 9), as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://michaelsaves.com/streaming/youtube-tv-raising-prices/">Michael Saves</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cordcuttersnews.com/youtube-tv-denies-price-hike-blames-verizon-ad-error/">Cord Cutters News</a>). Verizon had run an ad (albeit a little early) about a discounted YouTube TV price within its new bundle. The post states the listed price for the service was this $82.99 tag instead of the (now old) $72.99 price.</p><p>The publication spotted TeamYouTube on X denying the idea of a price hike earlier this week. However, the social media post has since been deleted.</p><p>YouTube TV states users can check their membership status by heading into their <strong>Settings > Membership</strong>.</p><p>The streaming service has a lengthy history of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tvs-price-increasing-65-month">continuously raising prices</a>. In 2021, the platform's monthly cost rose by $15 to $64.99 per month. Then, in March 2023,  YouTube TV took prices up <em>again</em>, which saw the final price <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-2023-price-increase">double what it started as originally</a>. Prices rose by $8 to $72.99 — and now we're met with a $10 jump today.</p><p>Its words today echo what was said last year, as YouTube TV stated the price hike was because "content costs have risen." It added that the rise in fees can help its team ensure "quality of service."</p>

It's simply a fact of life, but there's a difference between necessary and expected price increases — like inflation — and corporate price hikes. Over the past decade, it has become harder and harder to tell the difference between the two in the smartphone industry. Sale prices for phones across all price points are rising. It's an unfortunate trend for our wallets that, by all indications, won't get any better when Samsung officially unveils its upcoming Galaxy S25 series next year.</p><p>For context, Samsung might be one of the worst offenders when it comes to outrageous smartphone pricing. The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> is the most expensive non-foldable flagship Android phone on the market in the U.S. today, with a retail price of $1,299. The prior <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-ultra-review-understated-grandeur">Galaxy S23 Ultra</a> was cheaper, but Samsung axed the cheaper model with reduced RAM this year, and thus the cost is higher.</p><p>It did something similar with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>, raising the price of each by $100 despite minimal improvements. In other words, Samsung is no stranger to price hikes. On top of that, the already-high price of the Galaxy S24 Ultra leaves the brand little wiggle room. How much more expensive can this phone get?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rE4YGhpZYsVBh7ahzPSyhT" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-vs-Galaxy-S23-Ultra-camera-lenses-01.jpg" alt="Comparing the camera lens bumps on the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra vs S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rE4YGhpZYsVBh7ahzPSyhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>From the beginning, rumors indicated that Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset was more expensive than its predecessors. By nature, that would send shockwaves through the industry. OEMs could either eat the cost or pass the higher fee onto consumers — and I think we all know which option corporations are likely to choose.</p><p>In September, a reliable leaker claimed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-4-rumored-price-hike-sour">the price of a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> increased by about 20% compared to the prior generation, reaching about $190 — just for the system-on-a-chip. More recently, things have been quiet about Snapdragon 8 Elite and Galaxy S25 pricing. That is until this week when a Korean outlet reported on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-alleged-sporadic-price-increase-rumored">the possibility of a price increase for the Galaxy S25 series in some markets</a>.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.yna.co.kr/amp/view/AKR20241209139300017" target="_blank">Yonhap News</a> (Korean) believes that the higher cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, paired with unfavorable exchange rates, could lead to a price hike in South Korea — and possibly other markets. However, a separate report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,147437.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a> (German) notes that price increases might not affect every region.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Although the official prices of Snapdragon 8 Elite chipsets aren't public, they appear to be a driving factor behind talk about higher prices during this release cycle. The experts agree: according to a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/smartphone-asp-rising-on-soc-memory-price-increases" target="_blank">Counterpoint Research</a>, the rising global average sale price (ASP) of smartphones is linked to higher costs for processors and memory. Early Snapdragon 8 Elite-powered phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15">Xiaomi 15</a>, have been priced higher as a result.</p><p>Counterpoint Research associates the push for 3nm and 4nm process nodes with the price increases for silicon across the market. Qualcomm is using the 3nm fabrication process for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and, crucially, its custom Oryon core design. It's the same in-house design that helped the Snapdragon X laptop chip become a fan favorite.</p><p>Interestingly, the Snapdragon X Plus chip helped midrange laptops become more powerful and at approachable price points. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon 8 Elite looks to be a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but it is doing the opposite for affordability. It's fair to wonder if the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is really worth it if it drives the prices of the Samsung Galaxy S25 series even higher.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-yellow-grey-s-pen-03.jpg" alt="Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aW5aJXDvAiQnLpfxNZ3NE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not just the flagship phones getting more expensive, either. The SoC and memory costs are driving the global average sale price up <em>overall</em>. The global ASP is projected to rise 3% this year and 5% next year, according to counterpoint. You might be surprised to learn that even with 2024's projected 3% price increase, the global ASP for smartphones is just $365.</p><p>You're not entirely wrong for expecting that figure to be much higher. That's because the ultra-premium sector of the smartphone market, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>, is growing rapidly. And more Android phones are joining that category as price hikes continue to happen throughout the industry.</p><p>Counterpoint Research reports that sales of smartphones costing over $1,000 or more increased 18% year-over-year in the first half of 2024. Companies like Samsung continue to raise prices, and shockingly, we keep paying them. Will that change with the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<h2 id="we-shouldn-t-pay-more-for-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-series-2">We shouldn't pay more for the Samsung Galaxy S25 series </h2>
<p>Based on the latest leaks and rumors, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series will bring quite a few improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset is as good as advertised, and at least <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s25-series-fcc-listing-details-confirmed">some Galaxy S25 models are projected to get a larger screen</a>. However, many other things will likely be unchanged from the Galaxy S24 series, like the overall design and the camera hardware on certain models.</p><p>Put another way, the Galaxy S25 might be a great phone. It just probably won't be worth more than the Galaxy S24, which was already priced fairly high. The only way we, as consumers, can tell Samsung this is by resisting the temptation to upgrade to the latest generation of Galaxy. If the Galaxy S25 comes at a higher price yet again, I can say with absolute certainty I won't be buying it.</p>

<h2 id="everything-else-you-need-to-know-about-battery-life-and-charging-on-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Everything else you need to know about battery life and charging on the Pixel Watch 3</h2>
<p>Battery life on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best smartwatches</a> depends on a variety of factors, from usage habits to the number of GPS workouts tracked on a daily basis. Regardless of how you use the Pixel Watch 3, you should get at least a full day of usage on a single charge. Google's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/answer/13579780" target="_blank">support document</a> explains that the Pixel Watch 3's battery life will last up to 24 hours on a single charge with the always-on display turned on. The company tested battery life based on the median Pixel Watch user's usage habits, and with a mixture of talk, data, standby, and use of other features.</p><p>To get the most battery life out of your Pixel Watch 3, you'll want to enable Battery Saver. This setting will disable the always-on display and a few other features, but will keep tilt-to-wake active. In exchange, the Pixel Watch 3 will last up to 36 hours on a single charge. To turn on Battery Saver, tap the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel Watch 3, press <strong>Battery</strong>, and flip the <strong>Battery Saver</strong> toggle.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review#section-google-pixel-watch-3-battery-charging" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3 review</a>, Android Central's resident wearable expert Michael Hicks consistently got up to 48 hours with fairly intensive use, including the always-on display and at least one activity tracked.</p>

<p>Other testers at Android Central had less stellar battery life experience, but still found the Pixel Watch 3 to last longer than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a>. This could be partially related to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-will-bring-major-upgrades-to-battery-life-fitness-and-watch-faces">Wear OS 5's efficiency improvements</a>.</p><p>Charging speed will vary slightly between the Pixel Watch 3 (41mm) and the Pixel Watch 3 (45mm). The former has a 307mAh battery, while the latter has a 420mAh battery. It'll take the smaller Pixel Watch 3 about an hour to reach 100%, while the larger model takes 80 minutes to reach full capacity.</p><p>Battery life and charging was a significant downside of early Pixel Watch generations, and while it still isn't outstanding, the Pixel Watch 3 will last a full day on a single charge — even with heavy use — and charges relatively quickly.</p>

But the smartwatch has solid battery life that'll get you through the day and then some. Additionally, you'll get excellent software, Fitbit features, and great integration with Pixel phones.</p></p>
