<p>Last year, I wrote about how I was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/why-im-done-with-heart-rate-monitor-chest-straps">done with heart rate monitor chest straps</a>. Cut to 2025, and I still don't like them all that much. But after testing the new Garmin HRM 200 against the Polar H10 and COROS HRM across multiple runs, I'm happy to admit that I was overly harsh on chest straps.</p><p>Garmin sent me the HRM 200 with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">Instinct 3</a>, which I've been testing for months. By contrast, I shoved Garmin's chest strap into a drawer and <del>subconsciously suppressed its existence</del>, <em>ahem</em>, forgot about it until this week.</p><p>The Garmin HRM 200, like any chest strap, cuts out the wrist-based optical middleman and directly reads your heart's electrical signals for better accuracy. It's water resistant, highly affordable at $79, and lasts about a year before you need to swap out the batteries.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, I found it uncomfortable. But it did outperform my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a>'s Elevate v5 optical sensor for accuracy, for the sticklers who need near-perfect data. It's not standalone like the Garmin HRM-Pro, but otherwise, chest strap fans should love it.</p><p>I decided to test the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 against each other — and against my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-heart-rate-monitor-review">COROS HRM armband</a> that I much prefer — and give chest straps another chance to impress me.</p>

<h2 id="my-simple-beef-with-chest-straps-2">My simple beef with chest straps</h2>
<p>Chest straps aren't kind to people with dadbods. The strap naturally digs into my skin at the fit necessary to keep a consistent, non-slip connection.</p><p>I've lost enough weight in the past year that this is less of an issue than before, but my real complaint is how a chest strap keeps me out of the "zone." It hugs my chest with every breath, reminding me that my performance is being monitored and judged at all times, and making me self-conscious if my breathing rate gets high.</p><p>But I acknowledge that my dislikes may not apply to you. I think I'm more hypersensitive to tight clothing — like ties or skinny jeans — than other people. Just because <em>I</em> don't like chest straps doesn't mean I can ignore them; it's my job to give them a fair shake.</p>

<p>My more fundamental Polar H10 issue was how it produced bizarrely erratic results across several runs in 2024, no matter how well I adjusted the fit or wet the contact sensors.</p><p>Eventually, I discovered that my Polar H10 only worked as intended when connected to a smartwatch. I was using the option to track workouts directly in the Polar Beat app, and for whatever reason, the wonky phone-strap Bluetooth connection would sub in deflated readings at odd moments that badly skewed the results.</p><p>Once I started syncing my Polar H10 to a watch, it became a reliable control group for my accuracy tests. But I remained a bit suspicious that chest straps were overhyped.</p><p>Now that I had <em>two</em> chest straps, I decided it was time to see just how consistent these devices are, and if the accuracy gap is worth the trade-offs.</p>

<p>My only way to compare all three straps' data was to wear three smartwatches — Garmin Fenix 8, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/coros-pace-pro-review">COROS PACE Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Polar Vantage M3</a> — connected to each, with the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 stacked atop one another on my chest and the COROS optical sensor on my arm.</p><p>Aside from being a goofy-looking setup, I could only hope this close chest strap proximity wouldn't interfere with the results.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2155px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.39%;"><img id="p2fSga7A9rDXwz6MKPRUWj" name="chest-strap-accuracy-test" alt="A heart rate chart showing the results between the Garmin HRM 200, COROS HRM, and Polar H10 across a 7-mile run, with close results between the three." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p2fSga7A9rDXwz6MKPRUWj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2155" height="1129" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin HRM 200 vs. COROS HRM vs. Polar H10 heart rate results (<em>click the square for full-screen</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My hour-long, high-aerobic run started off shaky, with COROS' data elevated by about 30 bpm, Garmin taking a minute to catch up, and Polar having one early, random dip. But everything stabilized quickly, and there were no other issues for the remaining 58 minutes.</p><p>The chart above shows how all three devices compare, while the chart below focuses on the two chest straps. All three straps measured a 168 bpm average.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2155px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.29%;"><img id="UUFFTSMnyH8xDPZztTAkWX" name="chest-strap-accuracy-test-2" alt="A heart rate chart showing the results between the Garmin HRM 200 and Polar H10 across a 7-mile run, with close results between the two." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUFFTSMnyH8xDPZztTAkWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2155" height="933" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin HRM 200 vs. Polar H10 heart rate results (<em>click the square for full-screen</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Typically, wrist-based optical sensors fall 1–3 bpm short in my tests, with a noticeable delay when I change my pace or climb hills. The COROS HRM still shows a bit of that lag, but it's minimal enough that only the most fussy of runners would notice.</p><p>As for the two chest straps, they're in near-lockstep for the majority of the run, which impressed me!</p><p>The bigger accuracy test, as always, was the track workout. I foolishly ran it the next morning when I was still tired, so I struggled to hit my usual max-HR levels. But I still got almost three miles of sprints, hard running, jogging, and walking, challenging my heart rate monitors to follow the rapid changes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2155px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:43.34%;"><img id="bjLqCobJjrTvPhLEWLUshE" name="chest-strap-heart-rate-track-test" alt="A heart rate graph showing how the Garmin HRM 200, COROS HRM, and Polar H10 straps compare for heart rate accuracy." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bjLqCobJjrTvPhLEWLUshE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2155" height="934" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin HRM 200 vs. Polar H10 vs. COROS HRM heart rate results (<em>click the square for full-screen</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This time, there were noticeable gaps between the three devices. Both COROS and Polar lagged slightly behind Garmin's HR peaks and valleys instead of the two chest straps leaving the armband behind.</p><p>That doesn't mean Garmin's HRM 200 is more accurate, necessarily. The Polar H10 may have been slightly disadvantaged, placed beneath the HRM 200 so it wasn't as close to my heart. And I don't know if Garmin's <em>spikier</em> graph than Polar's steady one means it was faster at catching tiny HR fluctuations or was just slightly more inconsistent.</p><p>(<em>Note: </em>Ignore the Polar H10's one awkward flat-line near the end; it's a known issue where Polar's data freezes on the last HR result when you pause a workout. I tried to avoid pausing, but like I said, I was exhausted.)</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Garmin HRM 200 and COROS HRM both showed a 174 bpm average and 188 bpm maximum, while the Polar H10 fell 1 bpm short at 173 and 187, respectively. I'm happy to chalk that up to awkward chest placement, and it's <em>much</em> better than how my H10 performed in the past.</p><p>If I contrast that with every track workout test I've done with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a>, some wrist-based optical sensors are better than others, but even the best will fall a few beats per minute short of the mark. I understand why people rely on specialized HRM straps for the best data.</p>

<p>I'm always happy to change my opinion when confronted with new information. After a week of dual chest straps and wearing multiple watches at once, I can state what most people would consider obvious: chest straps' data is more consistent than I gave them credit for.</p><p>But I'm <em>not</em> budging on the other part of my argument. Yes, the COROS HRM optical readings aren't as immediately responsive and accurate as the Garmin HRM 200 or Polar H10. But the gap is so <em>minimal</em>, and an armband vanishes from my consciousness after five minutes while a chest strap takes up mental real estate the entire time.</p><p>Basically, unless you truly need the best-possible accuracy, I'd point you towards a COROS HRM or Polar Verity Sense to improve on your watch's unreliable readings — and I hope Garmin considers an arm-based sensor of its own.</p><p>If you're not as hypersensitive to tight devices as I am, the Garmin HRM 200 is an excellent deal for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners.</p>

<p>It's good to be informed; there is no denying that. But sometimes, we can lose focus and fixate on the problems, even when we're not experiencing them.

There was a time before Reddit, before every tech website on the internet (including this one) rushed to write an article about a software bug, and phones still had them — lots and lots of them. Coming from BlackBerry, I <em>know</em> what lots of bugs look like.</p>

<p>This isn't a brand or operating system issue, either, because they all are like this. The iPhone and iOS are filled with bugs, just like Google's own Pixel phones are. Android on your Samsung or OnePlus phone is filled with bugs. Windows Phone was filled with bugs. Even Palm and Nokia phones were a mess.</p><p>You either didn't care or (more likely) you only knew about the ones you noticed. I've been writing about tech for a long time, so I probably get extra exposure to these issues, but I can tell you that there are plenty of reported and verified problems that I've never been able to see for myself.</p>
<p>This is the new normal. It's not even a bad thing. It can become a bad thing when unhelpful people who might be endeared to a particular brand a little too much chime in with things like <em>"I don't have the problem, so it must be user error, or you probably just need to restart your phone,</em>" nonsense that inevitably pops up in places like Reddit or article comments and forums.</p><p>It's important to know about potential problems, though. For instance, if you have a Pixel, you should <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported" target="_blank">install a different alarm clock</a>. Do it before things happen.</p><p>We want to think of this as a new phenomenon. It's as if phone makers are purposefully releasing products early, knowing that the software is still a wreck, and they don't care. Just ship it!</p><p>That's probably partially true, but it has always been true. You probably never had the displeasure of using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/goodbye-blackberry">BlackBerry Storm</a>, but it was rushed to market when the first iPhone came out, and RIM (the company that was BlackBerry) eventually admitted to it. They wanted a big touchscreen phone on the market and did not care that it sucked.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi" name="USB-debugging-generic.jpg" alt="Using adb" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ukcG9WrVnudWXbkA7b9wQi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's just one example from the past, but there are plenty more from every phone maker. Most of the time, they eventually get it right; you just get to use an unfinished product for six months or so.</p><p>It's always going to be this way. Apple rushed its AI suite before it was ready. Samsung is doing everything it can to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">One UI 7</a> out and will "allow" more bugs than we want to make it happen. Google needs a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">refresher on processor throttling and power management</a> if it wants to keep designing chips.</p><p>We love to hate it, and sometimes hate to love it. But we need to get used to it. This isn't just a phone problem — everything you buy with a battery and a microprocessor is this way and will always be this way. And Reddit will have every person affected talking about it for you to read.</p>

And I'm basking in this sudden new trend of open-source watches as the big-name brands trend toward subscriptions.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/description" target="_blank"><strong>UNA Watch Kickstarter</strong></a> lists out its features: continuous heart rate, blood oxygen, steps, and floors climbed in normal settings, plus fitness features like HR zones, pace, laps, and (after launch) downloadable GPX routes. It has dual-frequency GPS and 10-day battery life.</p><p>Interestingly, it runs on the same Cortex-M33 coprocessor found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, only without the battery-guzzling Snapdragon.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:695px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK" name="UNA-Watch-with-app" alt="The UNA Watch on a wrist while the person's other hand holds an iPhone, showing a companion app with fitness data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/z79C4GMKNGhbyPUSBXujiK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="695" height="391" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I appreciate that the UNA Watch charges with a simple USB-C slot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">instead of a proprietary cable</a> and that you'll be able to buy modular upgrades like music storage or a mic/speaker combo and install them yourself. It also won't have any subscription.</p><p>You can even buy the dev tool for an extra $40 to add your own apps and firmware!</p><p>Pebble is much less fitness-focused, making UNA a better fit for my lifestyle. However, both share an open-source, enthusiast philosophy where people can code their own apps or add their own sensors as needed. In theory, the community will build up the UNA Watch's limited feature set — just as Pebble asked its community for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/how-to-help-build-open-source-pebble-software">help developing new software</a>.</p><p>My limited coding background makes it unlikely that I can help either community. But smartwatch brands have moved away from letting indie devs into their closed systems, to everyone's detriment. That's why devices like UNA and Pebble are so important and have me excited to buy into their communities.</p>
<h2 id="una-and-pebble-are-fighting-against-the-tide-2">UNA and Pebble are fighting against the tide</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've reviewed almost every mainstream smartwatch brand out there today, and it feels like they're all starting to converge on the same priorities.</p><p>Some wearable brands are honing in on offering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/were-entering-the-medical-era-of-wearables">medical-grade health tracking</a> and adding new data points like blood pressure and glucose. Others, like Garmin, are going all-in on AI as a pretense to charge more for premium features with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Connect Plus subscription</a>.</p><p>Basically, we're entering the heavyweight era of smartwatches, where brands bring in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">doctors for more accurate data</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">squeeze LLMs onto your wrist</a>. And while that's exciting in its way, it doesn't leave much room for experimentation — for smaller brands, tiny teams, or indie devs to try something new — because every watch needs a laundry list of features to compete.</p><p>Part of that is Apple's fault. I've previously written about how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">Apple's locked watch ecosystem forced wearable brands to focus on fitness</a> and how brands like Pebble today can't offer messaging, third-party app stores, or other smarts because of Apple's restrictions. Until the EU forces Apple to open up its ecosystem, that won't change (on iOS, at least).</p><p>That's why I'm considering dropping money on the UNA Watch or Pebble Watch, even though they're objectively less feature-packed than other watches on the market. To support brands that will go off the beaten industry path and try new things.</p>
<h2 id="more-modular-smartwatches-please-2">More modular smartwatches, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK" name="UNA-Watch-lineup" alt="Three UNA Watch models with different strap colors in a row on a dark table, showing different data on each watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVsDMLGiqToXa3vmEnufhK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="382" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UNA)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've seen other "hackable" watches recently like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pocuter/spectra">Spectra</a> that count on their community to come up with exciting ideas. But the UNA Watch is especially intriguing to me, assuming it lives up to the brand's promises.</p><p>I appreciate that you can take out the battery and replace it yourself. A lot of wearable tech isn't repairable — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-battery-tech-only-partially-solves-smart-rings-bigger-problem">especially smart rings</a> — and when your watch naturally loses capacity, manufacturers would rather that you buy a new watch than keep your old device chugging along.</p><p>With the UNA Watch, you can unscrew everything yourself, either to replace things or add new features years later. Based on the Kickstarter comments, they'll choose what new modules to make based on what the community asks for, such as the mic/speaker for Bluetooth calling.</p><p>Pebble originally tried letting people add "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-straps-failed-for-reason-but-deserve-second-chance">smart straps</a>" to augment their watches after the fact. I feel like UNA follows that legacy, except that the modules will slot directly onto the watch itself. The question will be how <em>many</em> modules you'll be able to add.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unawatch/meet-una-the-modular-gps-sports-watch/rewards">UNA Watch Kickstarter</a> will take place until May 2, with plenty of early-bird deals available to save $75 on the eventual list price. It's expected to ship in August 2025. Meanwhile, if you're more interested in Pebble, its new watches are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/">available for preorder now</a>, with lower prices but a later scheduled release date of December 2025.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eW3YVYPBj8kfJrwTwMX6qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'll start with a short explainer for people who aren't in the U.S. and might wonder what all this fuss is about.</p><p>People coming illegally into the U.S. across the southern border is one of the most polarizing issues in the United States. Half the country hates it, and half of those people hate even the legal immigration of people from another culture. The other half knows it's a problem but hates the first half of the people enough to pretend it's not. Yeah, it's stupid, but it is what it is.</p><p>With that out of the way, here's what's happening and how Google is reportedly involved. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://theintercept.com/2025/04/03/google-cbp-ai-border-surveillance-ibm-equitus/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>, U.S. Customs and Border Protection plans to revamp some old surveillance towers around Tucson, Arizona.</p><p>They want to install equipment that will use AI to identify every person and vehicle that approaches the border. That's OK, and even my cheap-ass <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/older-nest-cameras-are-getting-the-google-home-app-treatment">Nest camera</a> can do it. But — there's always a but — they want to use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ibm.com/products/maximo/asset-inspection" target="_blank">IBM's Maximo inspection software</a>, which is usually put in factory machines to do quality control inspections, to ferret out people with backpacks or otherwise look like they want to do some crimes or something.</p>
<p>Google (and Amazon, of course) is allegedly facilitating this by providing hosting services for data streams and tools to train AI. There is surely a lot of money involved, and Google is thirsty for it.</p><p>A few years ago, Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud CEO, said the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/google-cloud-ceo-kurian-to-employees-not-working-on-border-wall.html" target="_blank">wasn't going to do anything</a> to help create a "virtual border wall," but that was then, and this is now. Android Central has reached out to Google for a comment on its involvement with the project and will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>But let's be clear: Google is not providing any of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">its own AI tools</a> to make any of this happen, so even if it is involved, it's not directly being evil. It's just profiting from it.</p>
<h2 id="google-knows-better-2">Google knows better</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f" name="Google-cloud-mwc-sign-02.jpg" alt="Google Cloud at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NrC6Bo4HMBSdf7qf7Qq52f.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You might be asking, "<em>Jerry, why is protecting the border something evil</em>?" It's <strong>not</strong>. It's 100% definitely not evil in any way, shape, or form. A country needs to be able to control how people come in and out and what they carry through. I'm not part of the half who hate the other half enough to hide my head in the sand.</p><p>But there is a right way and a wrong way. First, you can't dehumanize people who just want a better life. This is the biggest point of contention among the U.S. populace, and you have to admit the current political administration has said and done some pretty dehumanizing things.</p><p>Doing anything to help here is a bad PR move for any company, let alone one the size of Google. The optics of this are terrible, and most of the people working for Google and using its products aren't going to like it. Best of all, internet tech websites will make sure everyone knows about it; it's what we do best.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-probably-not-going-to-work-because-ai-2">It's probably not going to work, because AI</h2>
<p>The other issue is that Google knows this <strong>isn't going to work</strong> but is probably still salivating to get involved and collect a huge amount of taxpayer money for hosting services. Sure, it doesn't have to be responsible for the problems and directly do evil shit, but it gets to sit back and watch, pass Go, and collect their money.</p><p>AI can be trained to find people wearing backpacks. That's probably simple to do; tedious and time-consuming, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-record-label-partnerships-but-is-it-a-good-idea">training an AI</a> for this is possible right now. Then what?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:912px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pH9HpCWrjHsxaaCdTrRwrb" name="YT-copyright-screen" alt="The copyright information screen in YouTube studio." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pH9HpCWrjHsxaaCdTrRwrb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="912" height="513" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You aren't naive enough to think some bad stuff isn't going to happen to anyone targeted by an AI super-robo-border-camera. Google <em>definitely</em> isn't. Google uses AI to monitor YouTube (along with other things), and even that is a bona fide mess that Google can't control. If AI can't learn to spot what is copyright protected and what isn't, it's not good enough to do <em>anything</em> to a human being.</p><p>The best thing that could happen is that a truck filled with real human agents intercept the target. I won't speculate on the worst-case scenario. Still, bad guy will be caught. Innocent people will also be caught.</p><p>I wouldn't go hunting or backpacking around Tucson if I were you.</p>
<p>Assuming Google really is involved, it isn't really in the wrong and is simply fulfilling another government cloud hosting contract. It's just one that's tied to a deeply politically dividing issue, and the company should know better.</p><p>It would be the same if Google were to develop an online repository to help register and track every gun in America: half the country would go crazy, and the other half would say it's great. It's not great — it's stupid, and there are plenty of different ways to get that government money.</p>

The<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906790896261067217" target="_blank"> tipster further indicated that</a> Samsung has "disabled it," which could indicate more work is required before it can be seen.</p><p>Another user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1892878357009699231" target="_blank">Josh Guy</a>, backs this claim by stating that the Now Brief feature appeared on the Galaxy S24 in One UI 7 Beta 4.

Rumors claim that implementing this new battery technology into the next Galaxy Ring could make it more costly as manufacturing such a battery is "much more" expensive than the lithium-ion alternative.</p><p>For now, it is rumored that Samsung will apply prototypes of this tech to the next Galaxy Ring "in the fourth quarter this year."

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Samsung has announced four new tablets across the last six months, all within the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 lineup. There's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-needs-apps-like-photoshop-to-succeed">Galaxy Tab S10 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>, which are big, powerful, and expensive offerings. This week, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus joined the club as smaller, less expensive options starting at $500.</p><p>But where's the base-model Galaxy Tab S10?</p><p>When Samsung neglected to release a new Galaxy Tab S10 alongside the Plus or Ultra models in October 2024, it was a bit puzzling. Without a regular Galaxy Tab S10, the lineup of newest Samsung tablets started at a $1,000 and a large 12.4-inch screen.</p><p>Now, it's even more odd that the South Korean tech giant is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">releasing two more Galaxy Tab S10 FE tablets</a> without making a standard-sized Galaxy Tab S10. It might seem like a small detail to harp on, but Samsung is still selling the Galaxy Tab S9 six months deep into the Galaxy Tab S10 series, which underscores why this is the company's most confusing tablet lineup yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-s-going-on-with-samsung-s-2025-tablet-lineup-2">What's going on with Samsung's 2025 tablet lineup?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung's core tablet lineup currently consists of five models: the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, Tab S10 Plus, Tab S9, Tab S10 FE Plus, and Tab S10 FE. The company actually sells more than that, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9">Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, Tab S9 FE Plus, and Tab S9</a> still available for purchase. But for now, let's focus on the main five models, which are the newest in their respective product lines.</p><p>Of those five Galaxy tablet models, there are five different screen sizes, two different display types,  and three different processors made by three different chipmakers between them.</p><p>This kind of lineup structure leads to customer confusion. If you want the latest processor, you'll need to get the Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus or Ultra, but that means you'll have to settle for a bigger screen.</p><p>If you prefer a smaller screen, you can't get a Galaxy Tab S10 tablet at all — you'll need to buy the Tab S9 with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-gen-2-vs-8-plus-gen-1-vs-8-gen-1">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 2</a>. It performs better in some situations — and worse in others — than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> in the Galaxy Tab S10 series. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE lineup adds a new processor into the mix, the Samsung Exynos 1580, which also powers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56</a>.</p>

<p>Since they're made by different companies and use different fabrication processes, it's hard to compare these three systems-on-a-chip to one another. On a larger scale, it's difficult to compare these tablets to one another despite all being Galaxy Tab products.</p><p>I suspect Samsung knows this because it conveniently leaves the chip name of each tablet off its respective spec sheet. Instead, it only lists its chips' core counts and clock speeds on the product pages for each of those five Galaxy Tab models. You'll have to dig much deeper to find out which processor powers which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablet</a>, as it isn't easily available on the company's product pages.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-empty-home-screen.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra - Empty Home Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NfrsoLNyaA2tqoScU3h5GX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The display sizes present a similar avenue for customer frustration. The Galaxy Tab S10 FE Plus has a larger, 13.1-inch LCD than the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus' 12.4-inch AMOLED. You'd think that all of Samsung's plus-sized tablets have similar form factors, but that isn't the case.</p>
<p>The lack of consistency across the five models makes the lineup's scalability poor. It's not easy to look at the Galaxy Tab S10 FE and decide to upgrade to a more premium model because the Galaxy Tab S9 is the natural upgrade path — but it sounds like a downgrade despite costing nearly double.</p><p>You can apply this general situation to comparisons between the two Galaxy Tab S10 models, the two Galaxy Tab S10 FE models, and the Galaxy Tab S9. There are so many differences that customers will feel overwhelmed, or simply won't be able to make an informed purchasing decision.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-in-hand.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Generative Edit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cAUyEgk2eVmsYftj7McfkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, do we even need a base-model Samsung Galaxy Tab S10? The answer is probably yes. Samsung introducing a Galaxy Tab S10 would immensely reduce confusion by eliminating the Tab S9 from the lineup, which is now the odd one out. It would also reduce the number of display types and processor models from three to two, and that's a big deal.</p><p>On the other hand, I could see the argument that the 10.9-inch Galaxy Tab S10 FE fills the hole left by the 11-inch Galaxy Tab S9 in the new lineup. Perhaps buyers of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> want bigger screens and only budget buyers like smaller ones.</p><p>One thing's for sure — the Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup is currently broken. Instead of adding two new Galaxy Tab S10 FE models to the party this week, perhaps Samsung should've given us a base model Galaxy Tab S10.</p>

<p>For me, the cover screen experience is one of the most important aspects of the modern <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phone</a>. At first glance, it can seem gimmicky, but the external display is actually pretty useful and helps keep the phone pocketable. In fact, I find myself utilizing the cover screen more than not when I use a flip phone. That said, no cover screen experience is perfect, although one company does come close.</p><p>Motorola has pretty much set the standard on what a cover screen should be with its Razr smartphones, while Samsung has gone a different route with the external display on the Galaxy Z Flip line. Still, both offer fairly similar experiences on both devices, and both have their strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>With that in mind, I decided to put them to the test to see which was the easiest to use without opening the phone. I would spend a whole day using <em>only</em> the cover screen on the Motorola Razr Plus 2024 and Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p>

<p>Off the bat, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> was a bit frustrating. Even before I got started, I had to go through quite a bit of set up to make sure I could get what I needed out of the cover screen, and Samsung doesn't make it easy.</p><p>Getting set up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen</a> is a bit of a chore in itself. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-multistar-button">One UI 7</a> update makes things a little more accessible, Samsung still limits cover screen interactions (especially notifications) to the apps you have set to use on the cover screen.</p><p>Furthermore, you can add more apps from the cover screen; you have to open the phone to edit cover screen widgets and add more apps that you may need. This is why the setup took some time, as I had to ensure I had all the apps I knew I would use within a 24-hour time span.</p>

<p>After everything was said and done, using the cover screen throughout the day was a bit of a mixed bag on the Galaxy Z Flip 6. Using the panels was a fine way to check the weather, control music, and perform other quick, glanceable tasks. The apps I set to work on the external display also worked mostly as expected on the smaller screen, although it did pose some challenges.</p><p>The somewhat small display made apps appear vertically scrunched, and some UI elements would awkwardly overlap. This would limit my view and even hide functions on apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> and Google Calendar, although they weren't unusable. However, the limitations of the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen would hinder me in other ways.</p>

<p>The quick settings menu on the cover screen is a fixed set of eight toggles that you can't change. Many of these are options that are actually useful, but the fact that I can't add others is really annoying, especially since I can edit quick settings on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">Galaxy Watch</a>.</p><p>I also can't just tap and hold the Bluetooth toggle to add a new device. I would have to open the Settings app (which you also can't access from the quick settings menu) and do it from there, which is pretty inconvenient.</p><p>Multitasking is also just not really a thing on the cover screen. If I open one app, I can't  open a Current Apps view to switch to another app. I would have to exit the app, swipe back to the Launcher panel, and then open the next app I was looking for. This becomes incredibly inconvenient when I need to copy something from one app and paste it into another.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention that even if you have Gboard as your default keyboard, you're stuck with Samsung Keyboard on the cover screen? Yeah, that's a no from me, dawg.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 failed the experiment. The experience was just too cumbersome with the limitations when multitasking, interacting with notifications, or trying to perform certain tasks that would require me to open the phone.</p>

<p>Things were a bit different with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, and while I was able to get through an entire day without opening the phone, the experience highlighted some of the shortcomings of the Razr cover screen.</p><p>Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip, I didn't have to go through any lengthy setup to get the cover screen ready. There were no apps to download to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-motorola-razr-cover-screen-apps">get my apps to work on the Razr cover screen</a>. I just enabled the app widget, tapped the pencil icon on the cover screen, and chose what apps I wanted or didn't want. I could always add or remove apps whenever I wanted without opening the phone.</p><p>Just like with the Galaxy Z Flip, Motorola also has a host of panels for quick access to weather, contacts, games, and even widgets. The home screen also lets me set four app shortcuts for your most used apps, which is pretty handy and saves me from having to swipe over to the app screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4175px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-vs-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-14.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Z Flip 6 next to the Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvoTMfEfVKtErR9GQ4UeZA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4175" height="2348" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As far as how apps work, it's pretty similar to the Galaxy Z Flip 6, although the larger cover screen means apps have more room to stretch. This keeps the app's own UI elements from blocking other parts of the app, although it also highlights another problem with Motorola's implementation: the cameras.</p><p>Because the dual camera system is set within the bottom right corner of the display, the sensors often block certain aspects of the UI. This is mostly a problem with text fields where buttons like Send are usually set to the bottom right side.</p><p>Fortunately, you can press and hold the bottom navigation bar to shift the bottom of the app UI up. It scrunches the app a bit, but you'll have full view of the parts covered by the camera, then you can press and hold it again to bring back the full screen view. It's not a huge issue, but it can feel cumbersome to do this constantly. Still, it shows Motorola thought hard about how to get the most out of the external display.</p>

<p>Social media apps like Instagram are also awkward to view on the Razr. Watching Reels or Stories will often just show a zoomed-in section of the video instead of a full view. The only time you can see the full view of Story is if you're watching your own, which is an odd behavior.</p>

<p>Aside from that, most apps behave and function as expected, which is refreshing. I can even multitask with a Current Apps view, which is <em>extremely</em> useful, and using the Galaxy Z Flip 6 cover screen, which doesn't have one, made me realize how much I rely on it. That also goes for the quick settings menu, which is much more robust on the Razr Plus and lets me have as many as 15 toggles that I unfortunately can't edit.</p><p>The downside is that Motorola doesn't allow me to open the Settings app from the cover screen, which is a weird omission. The Bluetooth toggle is also somewhat limited, letting me connect to previous devices but not pair with new ones. Fortunately, I didn't find myself needing to set up new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, the Razr Plus cover screen plays nicely with Google Services. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 is usable from the cover screen, but tapping a payment terminal won't pull up any sort of UI for visual confirmation, something the Razr will do.</p><p>I also cannot utilize 2FA on the Galaxy cover screen when signing into a Google account. It will just pull up a notification that I can't interact with, whereas the confirmation screen will appear on the Razr so I can tap <strong>Yes</strong>. I do this quite often, so it's an annoying limitation on the Z Flip.</p>

<p>There are few reasons why you'll want to use just the cover screen on these phones, unless you find the main display broken or unusable for some reason. However, the experience really highlights how they're different and where their strengths and weaknesses lie.</p><p>It's clear the Razr Plus 2024 has a better cover screen, but Motorola should continue to optimize it with future updates. A Settings app would be nice, for example, and it would be cool to view vertical videos on social media apps in their entirety instead of just a partial view.</p><p>Samsung needs to revamp its cover screen experience, starting with eliminating the MultiStar requirement to use third-party apps. That would be a major step to improving the phone and would definitely help me consider making the Galaxy Z Flip my primary phone over the Razr.</p><p>Still, both the Razr Plus 2024 and Galaxy Z Flip 6 are great phones, and even well into 2025, they remain two of the best flip phones on the market. That is until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr Plus 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> arrive, both of which could bring welcome improvements to the cover screen.</p>

<hr>
<p>We've been seeing several Motorola Razr 2025 series leaks pop up lately, considering the duo could be nearing launch sometime this month (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-60-ultra-early-database-certification-spotted">rumors</a>). The most recent leak shows off the Motorola Razr 2025 and the Razr Plus 2025 in all its hues and angles. Additionally, we have details on possible specs that this duo could launch with.</p><p>Starting with the Motorola Razr Plus 2025, prominent tipster Evan Blass took to X to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1907512687237415340">post a 30-second teaser</a> of the device, which looks a lot like the official teaser from the company itself. The video shows off the phone in all the rumored colorways, including the new Red, dark green faux leather, and the wood finish models.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-60-60-ultra-renders-specs-leak/">news site YTechB</a>, the colors will be called Pantone Scarab, Pantone Rio Red, Pantone Mountain Trail, and Pantone Cabaret.</p><p>Additionally, Blass shared a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1907512689611649306">thread of images of the Razr Plus 2025</a> showing the device from multiple angles, along with the images of the cover screen and the rumored action button on the left side. Furthermore, they posted another image indicating that this year's Plus model will come packed with additional<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai#section-moto-ai-features"> Moto AI </a>features.</p>

<p>As for the specs, the material posted by Blass all but confirms previous rumors that the Plus model will be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, much like some of today's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones"> best Android phones</a>, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Samsung Galaxy S25</a> series and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13"> OnePlus 13.</a></p><p>Other rumors indicate that the device could pack a dual-cell 4,275mAh battery (possibly 4,500mAh), up from 4,000mAh, plus faster 68W charging. While the design stays similar to the 2024 model, the cameras get a level up with dual 50MP rear cameras and a 50MP selfie shooter as well.</p><p>The Razr Plus 2025 will reportedly have 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage options, along with 8GB, 12GB, and 16GB RAM options, although it's not sure which configurations will be available in international markets or North America.</p>

<p>It wasn't only the Plus model that saw some massive leaks. Official-looking renders of the alleged 2025 standard Razr also showed up on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ytechb.com/exclusive-motorola-razr-60-60-ultra-renders-specs-leak/">YTechB</a>. According to the publication, Motorola will launch the Razr 2025 in three shades: Pantone Gibraltar Sea(deep blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/alleged-moto-razr-2025-shows-up-in-green-colorway">Spring Bug </a>(green), aligning with the previous rumors.</p><p>When it comes to design, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-razr-plus-2025-leaked-specs">recent leak</a> indicated that the phone could see a smaller 6.7-inch screen when compared to the 6.9-inch on the 2024 model. However, it seems like the company is sticking to the 6.9-inch foldable LTPO AMOLED display this year, according to YTechB. It will be powered by the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM.</p>

<p>While these leaks give away so many details about the clamshell duo, they must still be taken with caution. Motorola is yet to reveal its next flagship foldable and we expect that to happen sometime very soon. But while you wait, here's what we expect to see from this year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-plus-2025-design-display">Motorola Razr 2025 series.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Although Amazon's Big Spring Sale is over, there are still a few leftover phone and tablet deals remaining. One such deal includes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank"><strong>$120 OFF the Google Pixel Tablet at Amazon</strong></a>, nearly bringing this mid-range device back to its lowest price ever.</p><p>This deal is for the Pixel Tablet with 128GB of storage, and while it certainly isn't a premium-level device, it's plenty for most casual users and those with Google Home ecosystems. It also comes with 8GB of RAM, an 11-inch screen, and the user-friendly Pixel UI that many users like. While it probably isn't powerful enough for most hardcore gaming, it boasts the ability to multitask, manage smart home devices, and utilize Google AI features, along with quick compatibility with other Pixel devices. It's also worth noting that Google will be ending software updates for the Pixel Tablet next summer, though that might not be a big deal for some.</p>

This entry-level tablet is nothing too crazy, but it offers straightforward compatibility with other Pixel devices, Google smart home commands, Chromecast, and more, and it normally has a sticker price of $400.</p><p><strong>Price comparison:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-tablet-11-android-tablet-128gb-wifi-porcelain/6578701.p?skuId=6578701" target="_blank">Best Buy - $279.00</a> | <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_tablet" target="_blank">Google - $279.00</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Tablet-Extra-Long-Porcelain/dp/B0CZMFZMR8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="622fce8b-2e21-4111-b82d-06120b2ad394" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel Tablet (128GB):" data-dimension48="Google Pixel Tablet (128GB):" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're a fan of the Google-Android UI interface and/or you have other devices within the Pixel ecosystem; you need a low-cost, user-friendly tablet; you want a device that will let you utilize multi-tasking or control smart home devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a tablet that includes many years of Android updates; you want a device that's powerful enough for gaming.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> is highly considered a great device by those who like the Pixel ecosystem, and by those who are more casual tablet users.  It features a good-looking 11-inch screen, 8GB of RAM, Google AI features, and a simple user-friendly interface with the Pixel design language. You can get it in either 128GB or 256GB storage configurations, and in either Porcelain or Hazel colors.</p><p>Arguably the biggest downside to this tablet is Google's decision to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet/i-dont-want-the-pixel-tablet-to-die"> stop deploying updates for the Pixel tablet</a> next summer, but if that doesn't bother you, then this could be a solid pick while it's under $300.</p>

<ul><li>With a day to spare, TikTok avoids another ban in the U.S. after President Trump granted the platform an extension.</li><li>This is the second extension TikTok has received, with the first one set to expire April 5 before this last-minute reprieve.</li><li>A U.S. law originally set a deadline of Jan. 19 for the sale of TikTok U.S. or a nationwide ban, which has now been extended twice.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>TikTok will remain available for at least 75 more days as President Donald Trump extended the deadline requiring TikTok's sale of U.S. operations, he announced Friday, April 4 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114280893859636366" target="_blank">Truth Social</a>. This is the second time Trump has granted TikTok an extension, the first of which was set to expire on April 5 if the company did not reach a deal to divest its U.S. business.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">apprehensive toward the idea of a divestiture</a> in the past. TikTok previously went offline for a brief period starting Jan. 19, 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">but service was quickly restored.</a> The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title15/chapter123&edition=prelim" target="_blank">law banning TikTok</a> requires that any extensions made would require at least a path to the divestiture of TikTok U.S.</p><p>Statements from Trump and ByteDance spokespersons suggest that there could be a path to divestiture and a final resolution to this saga involving the world's most popular social media site.</p><p>"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress," Trump wrote in the Truth Social post. "The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed, which is why I am signing an Executive Order to keep TikTok up and running for an additional 75 days."</p>

<p>In a statement to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/trumps-extends-tiktok-second-time.html" target="_blank">CNBC</a>, a ByteDance spokesperson said that "an agreement has not been executed" and that "there are key matters to be resolved."</p><p>ByteDance appears to be working with the U.S. government to reach a divestiture agreement, which would need to be approved by the Chinese government. Another key part of the deal is the tariff situation between the U.S. and China, which President Trump specifically called out in his post announcing the extension.</p><p>"We hope to continue working in Good Faith with China, who I understand are not very happy about our Reciprocal Tariffs (Necessary for Fair and Balanced Trade between China and the U.S.A.!)," Trump added. "This proves that Tariffs are the most powerful Economic tool, and very important to our National Security!"</p><p>Months after the original TikTok ban was set to take effect as required by law, the social media platform has received another extension. That means users in the U.S. won't have to worry about the app shutting down or being <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-is-back-but-android-users-never-missed-out-in-the-first-place">unavailable for download in the region</a>.</p><p>"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark,'" Trump wrote.</p>

<hr>
<p>After staying mostly silent, rumors now claim to have discovered Samsung's next rugged smartphone.</p><p>Information obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-xvoer-7-specs">Android Headlines</a> claims users should look out for the Korean OEM's next XCover, the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro. Staying tough and durable throughout all kinds of weather and situations is the highlight of the XCover series, and that will seemingly continue. The publication purports the device will sport the U.S. military's MIL-STD-810H endurance standard.</p><p>Moreover, Samsung may provide it with an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance.</p><p>The next rugged phone may feature a 4,350mAh battery alongside 15W wired fast charging. This is rumored to power its 6.6-inch LCD, which has remained consistent over the XCover 7 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-announcement">the XCover 6 Pro</a>. While you wouldn't wow yourself with Samsung's rugged series cameras, the post suggests it could grab a 50MP primary lens and an 8MP ultrawide.</p><p>The selfie camera is reportedly 13MP, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">One UI 7</a> expected under the hood of it all.</p><p>The publication also purports the phone's starting price, which is supposedly €599 (~$654). Rumors claim the phone could launch in Europe "this month." There's no word yet about a global launch or at least one for U.S. consumers.</p>

<p>Some extremely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-next-gen-pro-rugged-devices-early-leak">early XCover leaks</a> surfaced in October, claiming Samsung was working on two Pro model devices. Those rumors said the company was developing a new XCover phone <em>and </em>tablet. The former was spotted with the model number SM-G766B; however, speculation said this would arrive as the "XCover 8 Pro." This assumption was based on Samsung's history in which the "Pro" version was always one number (generation) higher.</p><p>Strangely, Samsung might switch things up, as the current line of rumors purport the opposite.</p><p>Rumors continued two months later in December as the XCover 7 Pro (or 8 Pro) appeared in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-next-pro-rugged-phone-battery-certification">SafetyKorea database</a>. Information remained light, but it gave us a look at its potential battery capacity: 4,350mAh. This lines up with the current line of rumors, so perhaps we could see this. Once again, it looks like Samsung will make its battery removeable, a common occurrence for the XCover phone.</p><p>Tipsters claimed the phone could launch in mid-2025.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube detailed a host of new features on deck for Shorts creation for users this spring.</li><li>Content creators will receive a new video editor, based on user feedback, as well as the ability to sync clips to music.</li><li>Shorts Templates will open its doors to user photos from their phones and YouTube will add AI sticker generation.</li><li>During the Made by YouTube event, the platform highlighted a series of AI updates for content creators via its new "Inspirational" tab.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube is preparing users on its platform for a series of new features that should make the Shorts creation process worry-free.</p><p>The platform highlighted a handful of Shorts creation tools set to arrive "this spring" in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/new-creation-tools-youtube-shorts-2025/">blog post</a>. The bulk of these features concern the editing and final touch process of making Shorts. YouTube states users will soon notice a "new and improved" video editor in the app. The post states the platform is finally listening to user feedback by improving the ability for users to make "precise" edits for clips and specific times.</p><p>Users will have the ability to zoom in or snap in clips when attempting to strike the perfect timing. Moreover, the editor brings clip rearranging and deletion options "to create a rough cut," with timed text and music capabilities.</p><p>Regarding music, the editor will let content creators sync their Shorts clips with a chosen song. YouTube says this process happens "automatically" after selecting what song you'd like. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-shorts-longer-content-template-details">Templates</a>, which debuted last year, are receiving an update that lets users grab pictures from their phone's gallery and use them in Shorts.</p>

<p>Stickers in Shorts are receiving two updates this spring: one with AI and another that incorporates them into your videos. For the former, YouTube states its experimental AI software only requires a text description from users to create a sticker. The final update lets users take those newly created stickers and pop them into their Short.</p><p>YouTube has been slowly adding tools and features for content creation on its platform, but its AI is all wrapped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">in the Inspirational tab</a>. During its Made by YouTube event, the platform highlighted the new tab, which houses its AI tools for video creation, like the one for video generation. Users can "create a video" using text descriptions with its experimental AI that leverages Veo for six-second clips for Shorts.</p><p>YouTube's upcoming AI sticker generator will almost certainly fall into this Inspirational tab for users in the spring.</p><p>Elsewhere, the platform started testing its new AI-based remix option called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-song-restyle-ai-remix-test-spotted">Restyle</a>." Leveraging <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-watermarks-for-ai-generated-music">Dream Track</a>, users can pick from a few official, liscenced songs and turn them into something new. Restyling will provide users with a 30-second clip that they can use as background music for their Shorts.</p>

<ul><li>A report suggests Meta's Llama 4 has encountered a series of internal and external issues, forcing it into multiple delays.</li><li>Sources claim the company experienced increased pressure to do more with its machine learning following DeepSeek's startling arrival.</li><li>Meta is also looking to improve the AI's performance, reasoning, and math skills as it chases an alleged launch "later this month."</li><li>Meta's CEO Mark Zuckerberg teased Llama 4's 2025 launch last fall; however, the company also announced LlamaCon for April 29.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims the next iteration of Meta's LLM is still on the way, though it has run into a few roadblocks.</p><p>According to "people familiar with the matter," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/meta-nears-release-new-ai-model-performance-hiccups?offer=rtsu-engagement-25">The Information</a> (paywall) claims Meta's Llama 4 model has run into issues that have severely hindered its progress. Allegedly, one of the problems Meta ran into was with its competition, namely the Chinese-based AI model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a>. The publication states these "challenges" concerned the performance of this new competitor and the "additional pressure" to "push the ball forward" with its upcoming AI model.</p><p>Sources allege Meta's Llama 4 model will "borrow" from DeepSeek's machine-learning approach by deploying a new method called "mixture of experts."</p><p>The post states this new method will split up the AI's training, focusing on separate parts so each becomes "an expert" in its own regard. This could impact the AI on a more technical and, perhaps, hardware level, as Meta wouldn't need to force the entirety of Llama 4 to activate just for one task.</p><p>Elsewhere, sources claim Meta's Llama 4 "didn't perform well" during its internal benchmark tests. Its ability to process math and the AI's reasoning skills were reportedly the hardest hit areas. As Meta chases the title of best artificial intelligence, another area Llama 4 struggled with was conversations. The company allegedly wants Llama 4 to feel more "humanlike" when engaging with voice — which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/openai-trying-to-steal-scarlett-johanssons-voice-to-make-ai-feel-comfortable-is-the-reason-why-its-so-worrying">exactly what OpenAI did</a>, creating a surge of terrified responses.</p>

<p>Despite all the (reported) internal uncertainty of Llama 4, the publication purports the model is "aiming to release later this month."</p><p>We've been expecting Meta's Llama 4 for a while, ever since the company's CEO Mark Zuckerbeerg <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q3-2024-earnings">teased its upcoming launch</a> last fall. During its Q3 2024 earnings call, Zuckerberg stated Llama 4 is "expected" to launch in 2025 with improved capabilities. He highlighted that more users have utilized its AI model through Meta AI in places like Facebook, WhatsApp, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses</a>. However, the Information cites its alleged sources, stating the company could look to bring Llama 4 to business customers "more effectively."</p><p>Zuckerberg adds Llama 4 is expected to be "much faster" when it (hopefully) launches this year.</p><p>Also, Meta announced in February that it plans to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-announces-connect-2025-and-first-llamacon">LlamaCon</a>, a new developer event for those building with Llama, on April 29. The company said it plans to share "the latest on our open source AI developments" to help those developers build apps and products. Meta intends to spend roughly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">$65 billion on AI</a> this year, so the pressure is definitely on as it continues to develop the next LLM.</p><p>With rumors suggesting a Llama 4 launch "this month," perhaps it'll line up with LlamaCon — but we'll have to wait and see.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The father-and-son podcast duo is back with the second annual Ruff Talk VR Showcase, a show dedicated to new VR releases for 2025. The 40-minute show debuted 23 new games and updates, and it was a delight for indie game lovers.</p><p>This one comes hot on the heels of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/march-2025-vr-games-showcase-highlights">VR Gaming Showcase</a>, meaning there are plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/upcoming-meta-quest-games">upcoming Meta Quest games</a> for you to look forward to this year. In fact, a ton of games came out just this week, including Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate, Ghost Town, Stay: Forever Home, and Pinball FX VR. If you're ready for the next batch of excitement, though, check out the full show on YouTube and read my highlights below.</p>

<h2 id="the-2025-ruff-talk-vr-gaming-showcase-2">The 2025 Ruff Talk VR Gaming Showcase</h2>

<p>The full 40-minute showcase can be watched above.</p>
<h2 id="vestiges-fallen-tribes-2">Vestiges: Fallen Tribes</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UZr4v-PAK5M" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Wanadev Studio continues to flex its creative muscles with Vestiges: Fallen Tribes, a new take on the interactive board game concept. It's set in a unique sci-fi universe that blends the tribal desert style of Dune with the card-battling minifigure concepts in Demeo. After Ragnarock and the Propagation series, it's hard to think of a more different type of game for the team to tackle.</p><p>Like Demeo, Vestiges: Fallen Tribes is playable in VR and on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2511780/Vestiges_Fallen_Tribes/">desktop PC via Steam</a>, giving its gameplay a wide range of players and styles. Unlike Demeo, you control several units at a time, powering your army with a stack of cards that give them powers.</p><p>In addition to a seriously fantastic art style and fascinating universe, the game supports both PvP and PvE modes. That solo campaign features "dozens of missions, diverse objectives, and three playable tribes with distinct playstyles, offering players countless hours of strategy-based gameplay."</p><p>Expect the game to launch on April 24 on the Meta Quest platform.</p>
<h2 id="silent-north-2">Silent North</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Crh_NM4ZMjc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>The developer behind Ghosts of Tabor is back with another banger, this time set in the snowy landscape of the Swiss Alps. What once was a picturesque landscape is now dotted with waves of the undead. Combat Waffle Studios might have popularized survival extraction games in VR, but Silent North is here to redefine the concept with its PvPvE gameplay.</p><p>You'll need to visit villages and scavenge as many items as you can. Anything from clothes to food, guns, ammo, bandages, or even scrap can be used to aid your survival in the harsh wilderness. Not only are the zombies after you, though, but so are the players. Team up with humans or take them down and take their stuff. The choice is yours.</p><p>Silent North can be preordered now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/silent-north/6245697225519539/">on the Meta Quest platform</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2440750/Silent_North/">on Steam</a> with a special preorder discount.</p>
<h2 id="exer-gale-2">Exer Gale</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/12-MKHOfh-0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Pilotwings is a series that's seriously underappreciated by Nintendo. Developer Chark is making up for that by giving us a game that lets us fly freely and land softly in VR, all with a simple control scheme that makes flying easy for anyone. Just spread your wings (arms), and you'll naturally glide through the skies, racing other players or challenging yourself to top the leaderboards.</p><p>Like many of the most popular Meta Quest games, Exer Gale aims to be a social landing point that eschews complicated controls for pure fun. The developers said the game has been in development for years, primarily targeted as a single-player release with multiplayer to follow, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">changes in the VR landscape</a> have them reworking things to be multiplayer-centric on release.</p><p>Early access begins in June, so wishlist the game now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/exer-gale/8008532059164602/">Meta Quest</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078200/Exer_Gale/">Steam</a> platforms to get notified when it's available.</p>
<h2 id="disembodied-2">Disembodied</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZcmQ01399JU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>As a fan of the weirdest games available — Katamari Damacy is among my all-time favorites, for example — Disembodied immediately caught my attention. You use your hands to control a disembodied pair of hands with the goal of hopping and grabbing your way through this mixed reality 3D platformer.</p><p>Seeing your hands tethered together and walking on their own is a crazy enough experience, but that feeling gets even weirder when you start grabbing objects and tossing them across the level. It's an incredible bit of innovation that I'd love to see more of, and it's easily one of my most anticipated upcoming VR games.</p><p>Disembodied is coming to Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets "at some point," hopefully this year.</p>
<h2 id="loop-one-done-2">Loop One Done</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yBeBi-JYBGo" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>I've never really been interested in games like Factorio because they require a lot of calculation and far more time sitting in front of a screen than I want to do, but Loop One Done's physical interactions make this concept a lot more appealing to me.</p><p>You'll start by sending a drone to mine materials, guided entirely by your hand. That loop is then recorded and repeated forever, allowing you to focus on the next piece of the puzzle.</p><p>Directly interacting with your factory pieces and drones evokes a very "toy-like" quality that immediately gets me interested. This isn't just sorting through a visual spreadsheet of machines; it's actually placing the machines down, physically moving them, and even recording manual drone movements to make things happen.</p><p>The developer says he's been making the game for the last four years as it's evolved from a drone delivery game to a massive mixed reality factory automation game. It supports controllers and hand tracking, plus there's a miniature mode that makes it easy for players of any height to enjoy. Look for it to launch on the Meta Quest platform in early access on May 2.</p>
<h2 id="the-phoenix-gene-2">The Phoenix Gene</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MQf5iUJy38" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Many years ago, Sega promised us a Panzer Dragoon VR game. While that never materialized, The Phoenix Gene seems to have risen from the ashes and thrown a little bit of Rez in for good measure. As a <strong>huge</strong> fan of the Panzer Dragoon series, I'm always excited whenever I can play a new release, and the VR motion controls for The Phoenix Gene look like the perfect way to take the concept into the 2020s.</p><p>The developers describe controlling your phoenix as "like holding a paper plane." You'll move it around with your controllers, ducking, diving, and shooting your way through the game's colorful levels.</p><p>What particularly intrigues me is the ability to shoot 360 degrees around you at any time just by moving. The Panzer Dragoon games allowed you to swivel the camera in 90-degree segments but it was always a bit harrowing trying to multitask between different directions. This seems to solve that problem entirely, thanks to natural hand and head movement. You can wishlist the game now on Meta Quest with a release date of some time this year.</p>
<h2 id="pedal-rebel-vr-2">Pedal Rebel VR</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/71kSFf54pYI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>VR exercise games are a dime a dozen these days, and while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/underdogs-meta-quest">some games are hidden workout gems</a>, Pedal Rebel VR aims to turn that dusty exercise bike in your closet into a sweat-covered machine in no time. Strap a controller to either of your legs and get pedaling in this neon-soaked, 80s-flavored, fast-paced racer with a twist!</p><p>Instead of biking the serene countryside, as some other VR biking games have you doing, Pedal Rebel VR gets you rip-roaring down a highway at breakneck speeds, weaving through and dodging traffic to get high scores. It's a great twist on the concept of exercising at home, and it does something unlike we've seen before in VR.</p><p>Hit up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pedalrebelvr.com/">the official website</a> and join the Discord for a demo!</p>

Previously, the carrier made headlines by selling the phone for $5 per month when you signed up for the Unlimited Ultimate plan, and this deal is even better. In other words, if you&apos;re a big data user and you were planning to upgrade to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best unlimited plans</a> anyway, this is an outstanding opportunity. </p>

<p>The Galaxy S25 Ultra is easily one of the most powerful <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> on the market today. Unfortunately, it's also quite expensive, which is why I was stoked to see Verizon give it away for FREE when you add a line with the Unlimited Ultimate plan.

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is peak Android technology, coming complete with a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED display with built-in stylus, and all of the AI-boosted software features that you could ever want in a phone. Like the rest of the S25 series, you&apos;ll also be guaranteed to receive seven years of OS/security updates straight out of the box, and the upgraded camera system is one of the best we&apos;ve ever used. </p><p>Verizon&apos;s Unlimited Ultimate plan is equally impressive, giving users unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier&apos;s 5G Ultra Wideband network, international coverage in over 210 countries, and 60GB of premium mobile hotspot every single month. The plan starts at $90 per month for a single line, but you can drop that price down considerably by taking advantage of multiline discounts or other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>. </p>

<p>About a year from now, you'll probably start seeing headlines talking about "the end of the Pixel Tablet." That's because, as of June 2026, Google will no longer be releasing regular Android updates for its only "current" tablet. Instead, it will only receive security updates until those come to an end in 2028.</p><p>Late last year, rumors were ramping up that Google was working on at least one successor, possibly two. But it didn't take long for those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">rumors to get squashed</a>, leaving only the slimmest of hopes for a surprise. Unfortunately, that surprise has yet to be revealed, and since we haven't heard anything by now, it's <em>probably</em> safe to say that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google's latest tablet</a> experience is over.</p>

<h2 id="the-pixel-tablet-keeps-getting-left-out-2">The Pixel Tablet keeps getting left out</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QYMwvjLPKzPEPmp8v7Wq9H" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-pixel-7-pro.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 7 Pro and Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QYMwvjLPKzPEPmp8v7Wq9H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things that don't make any sense about Google's handling of the Pixel Tablet. First, I don't understand why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-review">Pixel 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-review">7 Pro</a> will see OS updates until 2027. All three devices are powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g2">Tensor G2</a>, while the Pixel 7 and Tablet both include 8GB of RAM. So if Google claims it's a hardware limitation, there's a pretty good chance it's blowing smoke.</p><p>Google changed its plans in December 2024 when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">extended software updates</a> for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series by another two years. But nowhere in that announcement did Google have anything to say about the Tablet, almost as if it forgot that it even exists.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AjVxpti6EDYrVHZPmWwH2N" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-16" alt="Gemini creating a Google Keep Note with a YouTube video summary on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AjVxpti6EDYrVHZPmWwH2N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the Pixel Tablet isn't perfect, but I like to think that it helped Google hone in on improving the Android experience on larger screens. If it weren't for the Pixel Tablet, there's a good chance that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/everyone-was-wrong-about-the-og-pixel-fold">Pixel Fold</a> could've been a complete failure, resulting in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> being shelved.</p><p>That's probably just me overthinking things a bit, but it's also not outside the realm of possibility.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also understand that the Pixel Tablet can't take advantage of everything that Gemini has to offer. This is a big reason why I thought we would've seen a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-2">Pixel Tablet 2</a> by now. Gemini has continued to improve, and it's finally reached the point that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-switch-from-google-assistant-to-gemini-might-kill-nest-speakers-and-displays">replacing Assistant</a> for good. And while you can use the Gemini app, practically none of its features will be performed locally on the Tablet, instead relying on the cloud.</p><p>Missing out on the full capabilities of Gemini might not seem like all that big of a deal, but there's still an unaddressed elephant in the room that Google continues to ignore — the Pixel Tablet is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-is-just-teasing-us-now-android-15-pixel-tablet">better Nest Hub Max</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-pixel-tablet-is-the-nest-hub-max-2-we-never-got-2">The Pixel Tablet is the Nest Hub Max 2 we never got</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FwNVAfLALAT6ZnWuDRbRRd" name="nest-hub-max-hero-jj.jpg" alt="Nest Hub Max Hero Jj" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FwNVAfLALAT6ZnWuDRbRRd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is why I don't want the Pixel Tablet to die yet. I mostly keep mine on the Charging Speaker Dock, as it's more responsive than either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-pixel-tablet-nest-hub-max-kitchen-test">Nest Hub Max in my kitchen</a> or the Nest Hub in my living room when I need to control my smart home. Plus, Hub Mode turns the Tablet into the hub for my smart home, putting all of the controls right on the screen and within arm's reach at my desk.</p><p>Again, I know that things won't just stop working even when Google stops sending security patches. But I'm not quite sure how I feel about letting the Pixel Tablet continue controlling my smart home when it's not as up-to-date or secure as it could be (granted, 2028 is still a while off). And like I said before, it's been better for me than the Nest Hub Max, so why would I want a downgraded experience?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1470px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="AM3hdN4XMgM6McGQqhNwtS" name="Murena-Pixel-Tablet-render" alt="Murena Pixel Tablet running /e/OS" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AM3hdN4XMgM6McGQqhNwtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1470" height="827" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Murena)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've taken a cursory glance at custom ROMs, just to get a basic idea of what might be available come this time next year. So far, I've found <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://e.foundation/e-os/">/e/OS</a>, but I still have more research to do before coming to any kind of decision. I mean, I don't want to go through the headache of dusting off my rooting skills just to find that the dock doesn't work or that there's some other feature that's missing. But that's for future me to worry about.</p><p>Ultimately, I would just love for Google to solve this problem for me by releasing either a new Pixel Tablet or Nest Hub Max. Or, it could do something it's never done and release an update that turns the former into the latter for good. Even if that means shipping the dumbed-down interface found on Google's smart displays, it would still be better than not having the Pixel Tablet at all.</p>
<h2 id="google-i-o-could-be-a-make-it-or-break-it-moment-2">Google I/O could be a make-it-or-break-it moment</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="63xNAdwbFLnE9PYhFByPXS" name="made-by-google-pixel-8-event-ns-50.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G3 hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/63xNAdwbFLnE9PYhFByPXS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this rate, I'd settle for a refreshed Pixel Tablet, with the only change being an upgraded chip for the sake of longer software support. It doesn't even have to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, as the Tensor G3-powered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">8 Pro</a> will receive updates until October 2030.</p><p>Do I think any of this is going to happen? Nope. But if something were to happen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">I/O 2025</a> is right around the corner, and that's probably when some type of announcement would be made.</p><p>I'm just keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best. Maybe putting this out into the ethos will result in getting what I want. It's already happened with Chromebooks, as I wrote about the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/where-have-all-the-chromebooks-gone">slow demise</a>" of the platform, only for MediaTek to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-kompanio-ultra-next-gen-chromebook-plus-announced">announce</a> a brand new chip. C'mon Google, make a liar out of me, please.</p>

But after years of mostly being quiet, Nintendo went on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">DMCA spree</a> last year, taking down the best Switch emulators, and now we know why.</p><p>Following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrTVeYm4iIM">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a>, the company published a series of articles and videos titled "Ask the Developers." As it turns out, Nintendo is doing the exact thing that it's trying to stop everyone else from doing — well, not <em>exactly</em> the same thing, but pretty darn close.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX" name="multiple-emulators-on-s25-ultra-odin-2-pocket-dmg-z-fold-6-1" alt="Emulation on Android devices with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, AYANEO Pocket DMG, Galaxy Z Fold 6, and AYN Odin 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7KpJHS5PoZ8nqGpw836PSX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" target="_blank">one of the interviews</a> published, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto and Takuirho Dohta were asked about backward compatibility with original Switch games. This might seem like an odd question, but it's because the Switch 2 is reliant upon a completely different architecture compared to its predecessor. As a result, it's not exactly as simple as taking your original Breath of the Wild cartridge, putting it in the Switch 2, and start playing.</p><p>When asked, "Does that mean the Switch and Switch 2 aren't compatible at a hardware level?" Dohta responded, "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1138px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QJVgRX5kQX5N2jStmDrrCf" name="nintendo-switch-2-and-nintendo-switch-gameplay-promo-render" alt="One person playing the Nintendo Switch, with the other playing with a Switch 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QJVgRX5kQX5N2jStmDrrCf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1138" height="640" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reading between the lines a bit, it sounds to me like Nintendo wanted to just use an emulator to run Switch 1 games on the Switch 2. However, there isn't enough power in the upcoming NVIDIA chip to allow for that without severely sacrificing battery life. It's a common problem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android and x86 handhelds</a> as newer consoles just chew through battery like there's no tomorrow.</p><p>To combat this problem, Nintendo took a slightly different approach, introducing something like a translation layer to relieve some of the pressure. This isn't unheard of, as Apple's M-series processors rely on Rosetta, and just last year, Microsoft introduced its Prism layer to accompany the Snapdragon Arm chips found in the latest Surface Laptop and Surface Pro models.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3" name="macbook-pro-14-microsoft-surface-pro-11-windows-central.jpg" alt="MacBook Pro 14 next to Surface Pro 11 on desk" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XsWQwguCiVAwk7xL4Atjm3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Rubino / Windows Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, there's another layer (pun intended) to how we're going to be able to play Switch 2 games, and I have a feeling it's Nintendo's way of trying to prevent, or at least slow down, Switch 2 emulation.</p><p>Currently, when you buy a physical Switch game, all of the game data and information is held on that cartridge. Slot it into your Switch, and it might need to install an update, but generally, you can just start playing.</p><p>For certain Switch 2 games, that won't be the case, as the physical cartridge is nothing more than a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415/~/nintendo-switch%26nbsp%3B2-game-key-card-overview">Game Key Card</a>." This means that you'll spend your hard-earned money, put the Game Cart into your Switch 2, and then wait until the game is actually downloaded from the cloud. It's sure to be a frustrating solution for some, but it's practically identical to what we've dealt with on Xbox and PlayStation consoles for years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:940px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="UUyqBJfDRVjRFW36N8Y9Bf" name="nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-graphic" alt="Game Key Card label on upcoming Switch 2 physical cartridge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UUyqBJfDRVjRFW36N8Y9Bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="940" height="529" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nintendo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Opting for this Game Key Card method isn't solely an attempt to curb emulation. There are other reasons, too, as the Switch 2 cartridges are limited to a 64GB capacity. This is double the amount of the original Switch, but still might not be enough, which helps explain why the Switch 2 features 256GB of built-in storage, compared to the 8GB from the original.</p><p>With that in mind, it will be interesting to see what, if anything, comes to Switch 2 emulation on non-Nintendo hardware like Android handhelds.</p><p>Now that the cat's out of the bag, Nintendo's warpath on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators </a>makes a lot more sense. And it's definitely a shame, as I love being able to play my favorite games using whatever device I want.</p><p>Ultimately, I think that we're going to experience a bit of a lull when it comes to Switch emulation. There have been quite a few attempts by others to pick up where Ryujinx and Yuzu left off, but it's just not the same vibe anymore. Thankfully, the Switch 2 release isn't too long of a wait, just long enough for me to still turn to my various Android gaming handhelds when the mood to play Switch games strikes.</p>

You can claim rewards, manage your account, and pay your bill all in the app. However, a slew of recent T-Mobile policy changes now make using the T-Life app a necessity for most transactions — even while physically in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile</a> store.</p><p>From the carrier's perspective, making the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-old-t-mobile-app-is-officially-gone-for-good-time-to-download-t-life">T-Life app</a> a staple of both at-home and in-store transactions could be intended to improve consistency. Like most cellular carriers, T-Mobile stores nationwide are made up of corporate retail outlets as well as independent, authorized retailers. As such, the in-store experience could be different depending on which store you walk into.</p><p>Both customers and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> employees seem unsatisfied by the carrier's reported changes, as chronicled by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1j1cy39/migration_to_tlife_from_employees_pov/?share_id=W1WHib9e-Q-WN4m_oDHip&utm_content=1&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=10&rdt=39554" target="_blank">multiple Reddit threads</a> on the r/tmobile subreddit. All the while, T-Mobile hasn't publicly acknowledged the policy shifts. Android Central reached out to T-Mobile for clarity on the changes, but the carrier didn't respond to our request for comment.</p><p>At least for now, it looks like T-Mobile's in-store experience is getting a lot more frustrating, and that's bad news for customers.</p>
<h2 id="t-mobile-is-pushing-t-life-hard-even-when-it-doesn-t-make-sense-2">T-Mobile is pushing T-Life hard, even when it doesn't make sense</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP" name="t-mobile-retail-storefront-169.jpg" alt="T-Mobile retail storefront" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I have a unique perspective on T-Mobile's reported changes — not only as someone who changes SIM cards or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-esim-android">eSIMs</a> between phones every week or so but also as the person tasked with helping all my friends and family members with carrier problems. For transparency, I'm an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/att">AT&T</a> customer, but I have tested phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-verizon-phones">Verizon</a> and T-Mobile service in the past.</p><p>Even as someone who writes about tech for a living, it's often easier for me to walk into a store than make account changes online. Instead of jumping through a million hoops, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-factor-authentication">2FA codes</a>, security questions, and IMEI numbers, I can tell a store associate exactly what I need — and they're happy to help. I'm usually in and out within a few minutes.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ" name="t-mobile-postpaid-magenta-on-s20.jpg" alt="T-Mobile Magenta plan information on an S20+" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CaZPop38EcXFxyZTngNwWZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's what the T-Mobile experience used to be like. Store representatives carried tablets that could be used to process transactions and assist customers on the back end. Now, both customers and employees claim that the bulk of T-Mobile transactions must be completed on the front end — also known as the T-Mobile app — even while in-store.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1jpntt9/bring_cash_if_you_want_to_transact_in_store">Bring Cash if you want to transact in store.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile">r/tmobile</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>There are seemingly endless reasons why this is a bad choice. For starters, certain groups of people, such as the elderly, are going to have a really hard time navigating the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-officially-kills-the-t-mobile-app-in-favor-of-t-life">T-Life app</a> to complete a transaction that should be simple. Yes, T-Mobile associates are going to be there to help, but it won't be as easy or as quick as just doing it themselves.</p><p>Additionally, there's the problem of people who have older or non-smart phones. Or, people whose phone has been lost or stolen. Or, people who want to pay in cash. What happens then?</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/1jpntt9/bring_cash_if_you_want_to_transact_in_store/" target="_blank">Reddit posts</a>, employees can assist customers with their tablets in those cases. In particular, cash transactions can't be done with the T-Life app, so that's an easy way to avoid this situation. But that begs the question: if T-Mobile is still supporting its backend, retailer infrastructure, why not offer that experience to everyone?</p>
<h2 id="t-mobile-should-reverse-this-change-and-quickly-2">T-Mobile should reverse this change, and quickly</h2>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a problem that's exclusive to T-Mobile. For example, I've been denied at the Apple Store trying to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">buy an iPhone</a> because I didn't make an appointment beforehand. I was just as frustrated as I am reading the experiences of T-Mobile customers trying to visit brick-and-mortar stores now.</p><p>Put simply, people visit retail stores in 2025 because they want a person to help them with the task at hand. They don't want someone to hold their hand while being forced to use the T-Life app. Until this policy is reversed, I suspect more T-Mobile customers will express their frustration with the T-Life app, as they've been doing on Reddit for the past few weeks.</p>

<p>I have had the Magic Laptop Power Bank from Raycon with me for many moons now. Yet somehow, it ended up sitting unused in my pile of gadgets until very recently.</p><p>Raycon is a Bluetooth audio accessory brand primarily, offering a decent range of budget earbuds and headphones. The brand also dabbles in cables and chargers, some of which I have tested before.</p><p>This product claims to be a 5-in-1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-battery-packs">portable charging solution</a> that can be used to charge laptops as well as wireless charging phones and accessories. Let me preface this hands-on testing by saying that Raycon's charging tech isn't very popular. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-raycon-usb-c-cables-are-insanely-cool-and-functional">Their excellent USB-C cables</a> aside, the brand's audio accessory department is what puts them on the map.</p><p>For Raycon to sell the Magic Laptop Power Bank, it needs to provide a very good reason why you shouldn't stick with better, more reputable brands with higher-quality power banks that are also much more powerful. I'm not sure it succeeds here.</p>
<h2 id="how-not-to-sell-a-product-2">How (not) to sell a product</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB" name="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" alt="Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3BEyLNzKFSJtiZyukyncKB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As it stands, Raycon failed to effectively advertise the Magic Laptop Power Bank. Here's why.</p><p>Buying a portable power bank isn't the most straightforward process. Once you've figured out what capacity is suitable for your needs, you also have to figure out how many ports you're looking for, whether wireless charging is a priority or not, and how much power you require on the go. There are other factors such as the size and weight of the power bank that matter too.</p><p>So now you know what sort of information a potential customer would actively seek out when looking to purchase a power bank. It was unreasonably challenging for me to glean these details about Raycon's power bank from the online store listing.</p>

<p>The brand's product listing is basically a lesson on how not to sell a power bank, as it doesn't properly highlight or mention most of these details. For example, the Raycon 5-in-1 Magic Power Bank listing doesn't clearly mention the batter's capacity; you have to scroll down to figure this out.</p><p>Also, the power output and input ratings are vague at best. Sure, we know it's a laptop power bank because it's in the name. But what does that mean in terms of rated power?</p><p>A USB-C laptop charges at 60W and above. But since this is a multi-ported power bank, it's essential to know the total power output of the portable battery, which one of the ports supplies that power, and how the power splits when multiple devices are plugged into it at once.</p><p>Most brands like Anker, UGREEN, Baseus, and INIU provide detailed specifications about the ports on their charging tech as well as power distribution charts that showcase what charging speed the combined use of all the ports delivers.</p>

<p>The build quality isn't great either, the built-in cable feels very cheap, and the charging speeds are nothing to write home about. The USB-C ports support a 65W power output, but the USB-A port can only do a measly 18W, and the input is limited to an abysmal 30W with the prongs. If you need speedy recharging, the USB-C port supports 45W PD input.</p><p>Not only are exact charging speeds missing from the conversation, but the size and weight are also omitted. The only place you can even learn of this info is from the quick start guide inside the box. Why would you buy a product and <em>then</em> find out its exact specs?</p><p>But do you know what the website <em>does</em> advertise? A built-in stand for phones. However, the review sample Raycon sent me doesn't even have one.</p><p>I'm not happy with the quality of the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 or the way it skips key details when trying to convince people that it's a worthwhile buy.</p><p>Based on this I'm going to deduce that you, the reader, are not going to waste your time on Raycon's power bank. And I can't fault you with that, because there are so many better options out there.</p>

<p>All that doesn't even factor in the price, which is usually steep for high-quality power banks and battery packs.</p><p>Cheaping out is the worst thing you could do with charging tech because it's quite literally a potential safety risk. There's a good reason why airlines have such tight regulations around power banks. This is why most folks don't mind spending a little more on a solid portable power bank anyway.</p><p>Raycon's power bank is relatively cheaper, but it's very chunky and hefty for a 15,000mAh battery pack. You can easily score a GaN power bank that's more compact for the same amount of money and with better technical specifications.</p><p>On top of that, the current market for portable batteries, power banks, and hybrid chargers is insanely diverse. It's not difficult to find the right battery catered towards any individual for a decent price. Anker and UGREEN alone make enough power bank models to satisfy anybody out there, with a wide mix of ports, capacity, and power.</p><p>I don't recommend the Raycon Magic Laptop Power Bank 5-in-1 at the end of the day. Why buy this when there are scores of fantastic, higher-quality options out there that disclose a lot more information?</p>

<p>Intel Unison, a free Windows app that connects <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> and tablets to PCs, is shutting down in just a few months. Users were notified of the impending shutdown this week on the Windows version of the app, and the Microsoft Store listing for Intel Unison was updated as well. By June 30, 2025, the app will be discontinued (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.neowin.net/news/intel-is-killing-an-awesome-free-windows-11-app-that-connects-pcs-with-phones/" target="_blank">Neowin</a>).</p><p>"Intel Unison will soon be discontinued," the Microsoft Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pp9gzm2gn26?hl=en-US&gl=US" target="_blank">listing</a> explains. "The first step in its wind-down process is ending service for most platforms at the end of June 2025. Lenovo Aura platforms will retain service through 2025."</p><p>Intel Unison offers a slew of features to make seamlessly connecting your Android devices to your Windows PCs. For <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, Intel Unison enables wireless external display connection. It also makes it possible to make calls and send texts from your Windows PC using your Android phone. On top of that, you can drag-and-drop files and photos between devices.</p><p>While some of these features are available using the Microsoft Phone Link app, many viewed the Intel Unison app as a more robust experience with additional capabilities. Of course, all of those features will be discontinued by Intel by the end of June.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus is preparing to launch a tiny OnePlus 13 model in China later this month.</li><li>The OnePlus 13T will sport a 6.3-inch display and pack a large battery.</li><li>In a Weibo post, OnePlus' head of China revealed that battery life was a focus point of OnePlus 13T development.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus is gearing up to release a smaller version of the OnePlus 13, and this week has been full of teasers. The company first revealed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">the OnePlus 13T would launch this month in China</a> in an April Fool's Day gag. Now, President of OnePlus China Louis Lee took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/5150921408644564" target="_blank">Weibo</a> to share more about the upcoming "mini" OnePlus flagship.</p><p>First, Lee said the development of the OnePlus 13T began with a small goal. OnePlus wanted to dispel the notion that small handsets can't have large battery. This "small goal" underscores the company's larger goal in designing a smaller version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> — which Lee describes as to "make users who want to buy small-screen mobile phones but still have concerns more assured."</p><p>With a rumored 6.3-inch display, the OnePlus 13T would be miniature by OnePlus' standards, but regularly-sized by 2025 standards overall. It's tipped, but unconfirmed, that the OnePlus 13T could have a battery capacity in excess of 6,000mAh despite its small form factor.</p>

<p>This time, we have also made great efforts in terms of battery and endurance. It will be equipped with a new generation of glacier batteries," Lee writes in the post, translated to English. "[The] OnePlus 13T will be the small-screen mobile phone with the largest battery capacity and the best battery life in history. The proper small-screen battery life is the king!"</p><p>Other leaks surfaced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">OnePlus 13T in a regulatory filing</a>, referred to as PKX110, revealing that the device will come with 80W fast charging. It's also expected to be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite </a>chipset and include a 50MP main camera sensor.</p><p>When it launches later this month, the OnePlus 13T will be the first "T-branded" device from the China phone-maker in three years. The last one was the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-10t-review"> OnePlus 10T</a>, which released in 2022.</p>

<hr>
<p>On Wednesday (April 2) we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025" target="_blank">reported</a> that Samsung is allegedly delaying the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge. Early reports indicated that the phone would launch around the second week of April. However, yesterday, we heard some murmur that the company will now launch the device in May or June.</p><p>While we speculated several reasons for the Korean OEM's decision, we finally seem to have some answers. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,150033.html" target="_blank">WinFuture</a>, sources close to Samsung told them that the launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge was postponed "at the last minute." The company said that they were dealing with some "technical issues with the device, which made further testing necessary."</p><p>Backing the publication's claims is German tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MaxJmb/status/1907320951802315009" target="_blank">Max Jambor</a>. In his X post, he added that while people are eagerly awaiting its launch, Samsung continues to "fine-tune" the Galaxy S25 Edge behind the scenes. "While the device won't launch on April 15, it will still see the light of day somewhere in Q2 this year," Jambor said.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-parts-teaser" alt="Components for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge on stage at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9fo8EsBntiCcnYkLJPARyh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While these could be valid reasons for the Korean OEM to steer clear from launching a new phone,  the German website feels that there could be external factors at play.</p><p>For starters, the site states that Samsung wants to avoid a lack of public interest due to the tense political situation in its home country, South Korea. The company could be stalling the release "because the previous head of the mobile device division, Noh Tae-moon, recently suffered a heart attack and passed away at the age of just 64," the website added.</p><p>Whatever the reason behind the delay, the Galaxy S25 Edge has been one of Samsung's most anticipated phones yet, as it has been hyping the device since the start of 2025. While the company did not confirm the April 15 launch, several sources supported this claim. However, Samsung reportedly sent news of the delay to certain telecom operators in Korea, who were all set to sell this device in April.</p>

<p>As for when to expect the launch of the Samsung S25 Edge; a recent report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-may-2025-launch-date/">SamMobile</a> indicates that the company is pushing its launch date just by a month and sources told the publication that the slim phone will be unveiled on May 13.</p><p>"The South Korean company will launch the S25 Edge in a smaller online-only presentation, though this could vary by country," the publication added.</p><p>In terms of spec, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to be 5.84mm thin, showcasing a titanium body and an Armor Aluminum frame. The phone could have a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>.</p><p>The phone is supposed to launch in three colors that match the Galaxy S25 Ultra: "Titanium Jet Black," "Titanium Silver," and "Titanium Icy Blue."  The Galaxy S25 Edge will have two rear cameras stacked vertically: a primary 200MP lens and a 12MP lens for ultra-wide shots, along with a selfie camera, which we don't have much information about. We also hear that the 256GB model will cost around €1,200–€1,300 ($1,300–$1,400), while the 512GB version might hit €1,300–€1,400 ($1,400–$1,520).</p><p>Lastly, WinFuture indicated that Samsung could soon release a video teasing the Galaxy S25 Edge, considering it could launch in the next two months.</p>

That means Android 16 has already achieved platform stability with the Beta 3 update, although it still isn't perfect. Any Google Pixel 6 or newer smartphone can test out the Android 16 beta by participating in the Android Beta Program, but what if you want out?</p><p>Luckily, it's possible to opt out of the Android Beta Program and uninstall the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 beta</a> if you have second thoughts. There are easy methods that completely erase your phone and one way to keep your data that requires a bit of patience. Let's dive in.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-ways-you-can-uninstall-the-android-16-beta-2">All the ways you can uninstall the Android 16 beta</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8" name="android-15-21.jpg" alt="Android 15 home page on Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsBa2t3vEyHabPemsFwwK8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We always recommend users back up their device before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">installing the Android 16 beta</a>, and there's a key reason for that — it's very inconvenient to uninstall the beta without erasing your data. The only way to uninstall the Android 16 beta is to wait for its official public release; all other methods require completely erasing your device. There are three options available:</p>
<ul><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for an over-the-air (OTA) update that erases your device, reverting it to the latest stable version.</li><li>Opt out of the Android Beta Program and wait for the stable version of the update you're testing, which will be sent as an over-the-air (OTA) update — <strong>this option can take up to three to four months</strong>.</li><li>Install a stable version of Android using the <a href="https://flash.android.com/" target="_blank">Android Flash Tool</a> or ADB — <strong>this involves sideloading, will erase ALL of your data, and is only recommended for advanced users</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>For most users, we recommend using the first method to opt out of the Android Beta Program an applying the OTA update. It will delete all the data on your phone, but this can be restored from an older device backup.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-opt-out-of-the-android-beta-program-2">How to opt out of the Android Beta Program</h2>
<p>Before you can receive an OTA update with a stable version of Android, you'll need to opt out of the Android Beta Program on the web. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Open the Android Beta Program site's Devices tab</strong> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices" target="_blank">direct link</a>). Make sure you are logged into the same Google account as your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. <strong>Find the device</strong> you want to unenroll from the Android Beta Program, and click <strong>Opt out</strong>.</p>

<p>3. After reading the disclaimer, <strong>click Leave beta</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nhqEMFuyy55nYUcvsWYwnC" name="Leave-Beta-Android" alt="Leave beta button on the Android Beta Program website." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nhqEMFuyy55nYUcvsWYwnC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>4. Your device is now removed from the Android 16 beta. Click <strong>Skip</strong> or <strong>Take Exit Survey </strong>to finish.</p>

<p>After opting out of the Android 16 beta on the web, you can return to a stable version of Android 15 by installing the OTA update sent to your device. This could take 24 hours to appear, and <strong>will delete your data</strong>.</p><p>If you didn't back up your device prior to installing the Android 16 beta, you <strong>should not</strong> install the update sent to your device within a day. Instead, you should wait for the stable version of the update to arrive. For example, if you are testing the Android 16 beta, you should wait for the first official Android 16 update in order to keep your data intact.</p><p>When you are ready to install the OTA update — either the rollback update or the official stable release — you'll need to follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on your Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Navigate to <strong>System</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>System update</strong>.</p><p>3. You may need to tap <strong>Check for update</strong> to find the latest OTA update.</p><p>4. When the update appears, follow the on-screen prompts to <strong>download and install it</strong>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RWhyinmyBsuHJonKCVdatY" name="Pixel-Install-Stable-Android-Version" alt="Checking for an update on a Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RWhyinmyBsuHJonKCVdatY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It may take a while for the update to be download and optimized for your device. Make sure your device is charged, or connected to power, to complete the update. Your phone might restart multiple times throughout this process, but when it is all said and done, you'll be running a stable version of Android 15.</p>

<p>There are many good reasons to uninstall the latest Android 16 beta, but they usually come to one key issue: bugs. Since the Android Beta Program entirely consists of pre-release software, it is riddled with bugs and issues. Even platform-stable updates, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Android 16 Beta 3</a>, are going to have problems you wouldn't face on a public version of Android — evidenced by the fact <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">Google released Android 16 Beta 3.1</a> to fix some of those very bugs.</p><p>If you've had enough of the instability or simply want to patiently wait for the public version of Android 16, there's always the option to uninstall the beta using these methods.</p>

<p>According to an inside source, Google will finally shake things up with its standard flagship model this year, at least with its camera.</p><p>Usually, the base models come with a wide and ultrawide lens. However, this time, it might get a third telephoto lens, and the tech giant is allegedly going to downgrade the whole camera setup to accommodate the new lens, so much so that these leaked specs reveal it being closer to the budget <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>.</p><p>The primary sensor on the Pixel 10 will allegedly be replaced by a Samsung GN8, a smaller one than the GNV sensor used in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.</p><p>"Similarly, the ultrawide lens has been downgraded to a Sony IMX712 from the previous IMX858," the publication states, noting that it will have a lower 13MP lens. It's seemingly a downgrade from last year's 48MP ultrawide camera. The publication adds that the new telephoto lens will get an 11MP resolution and Samsung 3J1 sensor, similar to the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>At the same time, the specs for the front-facing camera remain unchanged (11 MP).</p>

<p>While megapixels really don't dictate the quality of the image, the camera sensors do. And if this leak holds true, then the tech giant seems to be compromising on image quality to get an additional lens into the standard model.</p><p>While post-shoot edits and Google's computational photography will help improve image quality, a smaller sensor only makes shooting in low-light conditions even tougher. And seeing the specs of a budget model show up in a flagship device is certainly disappointing.</p><p>Rumors suggest that the Google Pixel 10 Pro and the Pro XL will keep last year's camera specs. However, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a minor change with its primary lens. "The primary Sony IMX787 (used in the Pixel 8a) will be replaced with the Samsung GN8 (used in the Pixel 9a)," the publication added.</p><p>That said, we know that all three phones will supposedly be retaining their designs as their predecessors, and will be powered by Google's new Tensor G5 SoC chip. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-alleged-porcelain-renderings-leaked">another leak indicated</a> that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could be offered at a "lower price point" compared to last year, and will be powered by the Tensor G5 as well.</p><p>Lastly, these leaks should be taken with a grain of salt as there's no confirmation that these specs will show up in the actual device. While we wait for the ball to drop, here's. what we expect to see from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series.</a></p>

<p>Except they never got to play because of one bug or another. One headset lost tracking and refused to allow us to work unless it was in travel mode — something that doesn't work when you're trying to play a game like Dungeons of Eternity since it restricts movement. One of the other headsets refused to populate the friends list, making it impossible for them to join a game together.

The company is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates. In many ways, it reminds me a lot of the Google Pixel series of phones, which have suffered from the same type of problem since the Pixel 6, and it's time Meta starts prioritizing stability over capability.</p>

<p>This year has been terrible for Meta Quest updates. There's no mincing words. Back in December, just as folks were unboxing their brand new Meta Quest 3S headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v72-bad-christmas-update">a bad update to firmware V72</a> began bricking devices. The company acknowledged the bad update within a few days but did a poor job communicating the issue to its customer service team.</p><p>That meant that not only could people <em>not use</em> the headset they just received as a gift, but some customers had to fight tooth and nail to get a warranty replacement in the first place. It wasn't a good first impression for new Meta Quest owners.</p><p>Not two months later, the V74 update rolled out, bringing amazing new features that could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-v74-feature-is-set-to-revolutionize-immersive-experiences">soon revolutionize immersive experiences</a>. Except that the feature shipped with serious experience-breaking bugs. As evidenced in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Announcements/PTC-v74-Release-Thread/ba-p/1288416">official V74 testing thread</a> on Meta's community forums, <strong>a lot</strong> of people found the update to be less than satisfactory.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta is too focused on shipping new features regularly than being concerned with delivering bug-free updates, and that's a huge problem.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>One Meta Quest V74 bug keeps the headset from charging fully, stopping at 74% for some unknown reason. Players noticed that severe network lag all of a sudden caused PC VR games to be unplayable. Secondary accounts on the headset wouldn't load games at all, and even after a "fix," there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://communityforums.atmeta.com/t5/Get-Help/PTC-v76-serious-secondary-account-issues/m-p/1309030">still severe issues</a> trying to play games on non-primary headset accounts.</p><p>A new bug causes the UI to randomly disappear when waking the device from sleep. Despite being flagged during the two-month testing phase, it was never fixed before V74 was released to the public. I could go on with several more examples, but you get the point: Meta Quest firmware updates are buggy, and they're causing people to get fed up with their headsets.</p><p>This doesn't exactly look good for a company that is actively fighting to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">protect its image</a> among VR enthusiasts while developers face <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">a very real visibility crisis</a>.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While it's true that Meta has been working hard to outplay potential competitors in the space with rapid feature evolution, the company isn't doing a great job of ensuring that existing users have a good experience. Mainly, that means having a <em>stable</em> experience.</p><p>One of the main reasons I stopped playing PC VR games years ago was because I was tired of the troubleshooting. Oftentimes, I would spend more time troubleshooting why a game wasn't working than I would actually playing the game. I went so far as to sell my PC last year and replace it with a Steam Deck so I could still play PC games without all the driver hassles and tinkering. I just want things to work, and that's why I play VR games on a Meta Quest.</p><p>Meta needs to remember that this is a gaming console. Like a Nintendo Switch 2, a PlayStation 5, or an Xbox Series X, Meta Quest gamers expect to put their headset on and play the game they want. They don't want to be bothered with troubleshooting or tinkering. That nonsense is for the PC players who enjoy graphical fidelity at the expense of tweaking and tinkering.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It's time for Meta to slow its update schedule down and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>As Meta moves forward with Meta Quest update V76, it's time the company starts taking stability more seriously and letting new features take a back seat to a quality experience. That means the company needs to start <strong>fixing bugs</strong> before releasing new firmware to the public. If a major bug still persists, a firmware update should be delayed until said bug has been squashed.</p><p>But as I've said, Google is just as guilty of this sin as Meta. Whether it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-6-devices-android-15-bricking-reports">phone-breaking Android updates</a>, weird <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">storage and display issues</a>, or even something as inconvenient as your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-users-late-start-alarm-issues-reported">morning alarm not sounding</a>, Google's phones often feel more like a testbed than a stable platform.</p><p>Any human-made piece of software is going to have problems or bugs that need squashing, but a regimen of monthly updates isn't what the doctor ordered for a stable computing platform. Rather, companies like Meta need to slow things down a bit and ensure that updates are something people look forward to rather than fear.</p><p>When users are constantly looking for ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flash-tool-downgrade-pixel-firmware">roll back software updates</a>, you know you've got a problem.</p><p>As the Meta Quest platform gains traction and becomes more mainstream, Meta must keep buggy updates away from its headsets. VR gaming already has enough friction without bugs and problems as it is without these silly, needless problems being added to it.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing has unveiled new devices for its flagship brand, but its more affordable sub-unit is just getting started with teasers.</p><p>Early today (Apr. 3), CMF by Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1907719990662340998">posted a teaser</a> for an upcoming device with a quick video that indicates one its core upgrades (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/04/03/nothing-shares-first-teaser-for-cmf-phone-2/">Gizmochina</a>). The short video seemingly shows off a singular camera lens on the back of an orange CMF Phone. The clip showcases the device with deep technological ridges and cuts. It's unclear if these could be real features on the phone's rear panel or just for visual effect.</p><p>Additionally, CMF by Nothing adds the tagline, "In search of the perfect shot," and finishes with "coming soon."</p><p>The publication also highlighted a recent discovery of a Nothing member's post of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/29/nothing-teases-4-new-devices/">several Pokemon</a>. It's been assumed that the Pokemon symbolizes the codenames for upcoming devices from the CMF sub-brand. Bulbasaur reportedly concerns the CMF Phone 2, while the remaining three Pokemon could indicate new wearables and earbuds from the affordable brand.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In search of the perfect shot.Coming soon. pic.twitter.com/tEbBVUB6UX<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907719990662340998">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Showing a singular lens for this (ideally) second CMF Phone might seem odd when you remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">the first model</a> had a dual array. However, images for a set of alleged CMF Phone 2 prototypes appeared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact/#lightbox">on Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/new-nothing-cmf-phone-2-leak-suggests-it-might-be-a-samsung-galaxy-a26-killer_id168658">Phone Arena</a>). The photos showcase the device in black, but the takeaway is that it sports a triple-camera array. The device is showcased with the vertical dual array that we've seen previously, but that third lens is off to the side with its LED flash right beneath it.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING/comments/1jezu35/cmf_phone_2_and_i_think_its_compact">Cmf phone 2 and i think its compact</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NOTHING">r/NOTHING</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The tipster on Reddit claims the phone is "compact." Unfortunately, the specifics of this extra lens weren't stated. The CMF Phone 1 delivered a 50MP main lens with EIS and a 2x zoom, portrait mode only lens.</p><p>We've had the idea of a "CMF Phone 2" in the back of our minds <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-future-trio-specs-database-leak">since rumors about it</a> surfaced in December. The device was reportedly discovered within the IMEI database alongside Nothing's Phone 3a and 3a Plus. While the former <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">have already launched</a>, the CMF Phone 2 supposedly holds model number A001 internally.</p><p>Little else about the device was discovered a few months ago, but if CMF by Nothing is teasing it, there's a chance launch isn't far away.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The Samsung Galaxy Ring 2 could arrive soon with a denser "Dream Battery." And for now, that's probably the best we can hope for to make smart rings longer-lasting. But there's a more fundamental fix — patented by Oura, unsurprisingly — that I think Samsung needs to consider for the Galaxy Ring's future.</p><p>According to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">report</a>, Samsung is considering using solid electrolytes instead of a traditional lithium-ion battery, increasing the energy density from 200 to 360Wh/L and offering greater flexibility that would be perfect for this rounded form factor.</p><p>The Galaxy Ring 2 could be the "first case" of Samsung using this tech, followed by the Galaxy Buds and Watch in later years. However, the report stresses that this battery tech is quite expensive; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> is already costlier than most smart rings at $399, and this battery could push the Ring 2 over the edge of what most people will pay.</p><p>But let's ignore cost and say that Samsung can increase its Ring's battery efficiency. Its <em>capacity</em> will still be limited by physics and thermals, and the lack of smart ring repairability means any battery problem will be fatal. That is unless <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> start to become more modular.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-with-smart-rings-2">The problem with smart rings</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-battery-life-01.jpg" alt="The gold Samsung Galaxy Ring alongside the Samsung Wearables app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3sGWcko3E7aG2PnDTK5TxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultrahuman is one of the few smart ring brands to speak openly about battery health. On its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ultrahuman.com/ring/faq/">FAQ page</a>, it promises that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman Ring Air</a> lasts 500 charging cycles "before there is any significant decline in battery performance," but that "a gradual reduction in battery life can be expected after 1 to 2 years" and wouldn't be covered by the warranty.</p><p>Even if other brands don't say it outright, smart rings are especially susceptible to battery issues. Most can only squeeze in about 20–30mAh of capacity while keeping the design skinny. They're optimized at the start to go a week on minimal capacity, but <em>any</em> loss of capacity will have an outsized effect over time. You'll probably notice the same issue with wireless earbuds.</p><p>Let's make an unscientific guess that Samsung's dream battery increases the Galaxy Ring 2 capacity to 50mAh, or even 100mAh. That's still on a scale well below a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> (300–425mAh) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> (4,000–5,000mAh), with natural drain after a couple of years but with capacity to spare.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-showing-logo.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfqvMSCCxKbLw7zSnUdfPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>More importantly, your Galaxy watch or phone is repairable; you can <em>replace</em> a deficient battery.</p><p>That wouldn't apply to Samsung's curved electrode battery, shoved into a dense, complex design. Generally speaking, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech">smart rings are disposable tech</a> because once they're constructed, you can't take them apart and put them back together again. This lack of repairability hurts consumers <em>and</em> manufacturers.</p><p>After I reviewed the Ultrahuman Ring Air, my fiancee decided to buy one and loved it. But after 3 months, it suddenly died, refusing to charge or reconnect to her phone.</p><p>Because it fell under warranty, Ultrahuman had to mail her a brand new one. It couldn't be repaired and sent back or refurbished for a new sale. It might not even be able to figure out what went wrong with it or if it was her fault (it wasn't). It just has to keep making new rings and throwing out the old ones — which must be expensive, depending on the failure rate.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-smart-ring-battery-solution-2">The real smart ring battery solution</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4" name="oura-ring-patent-module-1" alt="A patent figure showing a smart ring with a pre-designed cavity that an attachable module could slot into." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BeCuwuZWt7RVvEXLSFfmU4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: UPSTO / Oura Health Oy)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When researching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-5">Oura Ring 5</a>, I discovered a ton of cool patents for redesigning its ring, mostly to make it one-size-fits-all. But I was most intrigued by patent US-12177997-B2, "Functional cover with wireless connection for ring wearable." As the patent figure above shows, the ring could have a removable module that slides into a predesigned cavity.</p><p>Why design it this way? For one thing, the battery is "frequently the module in a device that declines in performance most quickly," so when it fails, "a user may be forced to upgrade to a newer module...even though the previous wearable device otherwise operated as intended."</p><p>With Oura's design, the ring top would be removable, so users could slot in a new battery module, or slot in modules designed for other purposes like fitness tracking, contactless payments, location tracking, and so on.</p><p>Thus, buying a replacement module would be less expensive than buying a new ring, and you could hypothetically own two battery modules and swap between them when one dies, so you never have to take the ring off.</p>

<p>I have no idea how easy this would be to implement or if such a module would blend in as a normal-looking ring top. Oura has other patents it could use instead, like US-20240385649-A1 — "Wearable Ring Device with Battery in Cover" — that focuses instead on squeezing a thin, 360º battery layer into the cover so that it doesn't interfere with the internal components.</p><p>It's not about what Oura ends up doing; it's that Oura evidently knows that the status quo — short-lived rings you can't repair or improve over time — hurts them with consumers who don't want to spend $300–400 every two or three years on a new ring. And it's looking for solutions.</p><p>Samsung's solid-state battery is an intriguing solution, too! But it's a stop-gap measure. In theory, it'll build up the Galaxy Ring 2 battery life so much that even when it loses capacity, it'll still last long enough to avoid daily charges. But it's still a battery shoved into a device you can't open without breaking it.</p><p>So long as smart rings cannot be repaired or refurbished, consumers will hesitate to buy one after another, not knowing how long they'll last.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung was spotted publishing a patent for its smart ring that involves quite a unique charging method.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-ring-could-use-a-novel-way-to-charge/">SamMobile</a> highlights this new patent in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025063477">WIPO</a>, which explains the idea of charging your Galaxy Ring with your Galaxy phone. The patent in question explores the possibility of slotting the device into a circular opening on the back of a Galaxy phone. Samsung's title for the patent is "Electronic Device Comprising Seating Structure."</p><p>The Korean OEM provided a quick sketch of the theorized product, which shows a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> around a circular peg, similar to the device's current charging method in its case. The sketch doesn't explain if the Ring would be flush to the phone's back or if it would stick out a little while it's charging.</p><p>The illustration previews what the internal components would look like, which hold the pins for the electrical charge.</p><p>The publication spotted a few more details in the full abstract, such as Samsung's idea of bringing this method to foldables, as well as "certain cases." Elsewhere, it noticed the company mention the possibility for the Galaxy Ring to upload "health and fitness data" when slotted for charging.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:154.24%;"><img id="FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4" name="samsung-galaxy-ring-galaxy-phone-slotted-charging-patent" alt="Samsung recently published a patent that shows a Galaxy Ring charging method within a Galaxy phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmQqRAvQBEkJXopHWYR7G4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="389" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WIPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's probably no surprise that the existence of a patent means nothing without official company statements. There's a chance we might never see this idea, especially when you consider Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-is-working-on-a-thin-galaxy-z-fold-phone-with-s-pen-support">recent trend of thin phones</a>. It's even been rumored to remove the S Pen digitizer from its next Galaxy Z Fold for the sake of making it thinner — and the stylus was able to charge from within, too.</p><p>We've seen unique (and cool) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-resizing-patent-discovered">Galaxy Ring patents before</a>, like one from October that showed elastic internals that could alter its size to fit your finger. Samsung published that new patent last fall in South Korea with illustrations of a smart ring with a "resizing structure." The company also described it as "transformable," depending on the person. The patent explained three resizing structures for its rings with three, four, and eight internal segments.</p><p>Those segments would enable more or less "resizing" for your finger.</p><p>It's a neat idea, but there's nothing actionable to make this feel real amid rising interests in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-2">Galaxy Ring 2</a>. There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-ring-2-new-enhancements-launch-rumored">were rumors</a> that the Korean OEM could reveal this next device "earlier" with an increased battery life and a thinner build. Additionally, a more recent report from South Korea claims Samsung is looking to implement "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">dream batteries</a>," more commonly known as "all-solid-state batteries," in the Ring 2, which could give it a battery capacity boost.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has started rolling out yet another beta for its latest Android 16 operating system. The new incremental update comes right after two weeks when the Android 16 Beta 3.1 was rolled out for Pixel phones.</p><p>The latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 update, bearing <strong>BP22.250221.015</strong> version, includes a bunch of fixes, including for devices like Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The fixes with the latest firmware include an issue that caused haptic feedback to be miscalibrated in some cases. An issue causing excessive battery drain on some Pixel phones even when they weren't in use seems to have been fixed as well.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1jpyjyy/android_16_beta_32_now_available">Android 16 Beta 3.2 now available!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta">r/android_beta</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Talking about the Pixel 6 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Pixel 6 Pro</a>, this update is fixing an issue of screen flickers while shooting pictures or videos on their devices. Additionally, other issues, which seem to have been impacting system stability and usability, have also been addressed with the latest beta 3.2 update.</p><p>For those unaware, the latest Android 16 Beta 3.2 is available for beta testers using Pixel 6 and above. They are likely to receive the Over the Air (OTA) update within the first 24 hours of the release, which was initially announced on April 2. Users can navigate to Settings> System> System updates on their aforementioned Pixel owners, provided they are already enrolled in the beta program.</p>

<p>It appears Google is cleaning things up for Android 16  stable release with incremental updates rolling out. As mentioned, the search giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-rolls-out-android-16-beta-3-1-patch-with-crucial-bug-fixes">rolled out beta 3.1</a> update in March, which also didn't include any new features but rather only included bug fixes.</p><p>Some of the notable ones comprised brightness levels fluctuating issues and some of the Pixel phones experienced Settings app crashes, which were also addressed in the same beta update.</p><p>On the other hand, Google is also gearing up for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">IO event</a>, which is scheduled for May 20 and is taking place at Shoreline Amphitheatre, Mountain View, California. We expect to see more of Android 16 alongside Google's AI innovations at the event.</p>

<p>Google recently highlighted a brand new iteration of its Photos app integration with its  AI model, Gemini.</p><p>As Google upgrades the Gemini mobile app, a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15734842">support document</a> states that users can "search for a specific memory or recall information" from their gallery. Users can do so in a variety of ways, beginning with Google's Photos app prompts. The document highlights the ability for users to use natural language with specifics about themes and past events.</p><p>Using the @Google Photos (or "my photos" alternatively) tag, the company gives the following example: "What themes have we had for Lena’s birthday parties?" Additionally, you can say something like, "What are the top 10 things we saw on our last trip?"</p><p>Specifically, the document states users can " ask for photos" and "ask about them." Users can find specific faces and relationships in photos stored in their gallery. The Photos app integration in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will also accept questions about locations and the dates a picture was taken. Moreover, users can attempt to describe the photo they're looking for and have Gemini take care of the rest.</p><p>Once Gemini discovers what you're looking for, Google says users can tap the picture in the AI's app, which will open it fully in the Photos app. Similarly, if the AI surfaced an entire album for you, interacting with it will open its entirety in Photos. Google adds that Android phones and tablets can "Drag and drop a photo from the Gemini on-screen overlay into another app."</p>

<p>These new Gemini and Photos app abilities are arriving in the model's Android app (tablets included); however, it's only for a "selected group of invited users." Google warns that not everyone will receive early access. Your prompts must be in English for this test.

<p>On the surface, what the company is highlighting seems extremely similar to its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-photos-gemini-powered-early-access-waitlist">Ask Photos</a>" test currently in early access via Labs. In fact, Google directly mentions this in its recent support document, stating users can try and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/15318661">opt-in</a>. Early Access in Labs kicked off in September with Google's confidence that Gemini could "understand the context" of your gallery.</p><p>The "Ask Photos" test involves a bit of Gemini's influence directly inside the Photos app, but Google's recent updates bring stronger integration via the AI's app on mobile.</p><p>With that in mind, perhaps it's a product of Google's huge <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-gemini-app-huge-flash-thinking-model-updates-announced">Gemini app personalization update</a> announcement. In that press release, the company mentioned the Photos app directly, stating users can ask for help/questions "based on your photos." It didn't mention any 2.0 Flash Thinking experimental influence, but it could be there under the hood.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung recently filed a patent on the World Intellectual Property Org.'s website showcasing sketches of a phone that folds four times.</li><li>The images show four screen panels that are connected with multiple hinges, allowing them to close inward.</li><li>The panels will be topped with a single glass cover display to give the device a crease-free look.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Looks like Samsung is taking foldables to the next level; as we wait for its first tri-fold device, aka the Galaxy G-fold, to show up, the company already seems to be working on a quad-fold phone.</p><p>The Korean OEM recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025063475">filed a patent</a> on WIPO's (World Intellectual Property Organization) website showcasing a quad-fold phone, meaning a phone that could fold four times. The patent is titled "Electronic device including a bendable display" and was uploaded to the site on 27 March (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-latest-patent-reveals-a-quad-fold-device-with-a-unique-design/">Sammy Guru</a>).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MobhKPoCYgUak8UZ5V47tD" name="Samsung-Quad-fold-Phone-patent" alt="Samsung files patent for quad fold device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MobhKPoCYgUak8UZ5V47tD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO))</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The listing reveals several graphics of the potential design the phone could carry. It shows multiple angles of the multi-fold device, both folded and unfolded. In the image above, we see four screen panels connected together with multiple hinges, allowing it to fold inward.</p><p>It looks like the multi-fold will see the same functionality as the "tri-fold" phone, only that it will have each panel folding inward instead of just one, as some tri-fold phones have been shown to do. Assuming there's just one display across all hinges, this would give the device a large, tablet-like screen when folded outwards or as a compact phone that they can slide into their pockets when all sides are folded in.</p><p>While this is still a patent and doesn't mean that these illustrations will turn into usable devices, there may be some solid foundation that Samsung is building on.  The tech giant recently showed off prototypes of multi-fold screens at this year's MWC last month— <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mwc-2025-coolest-things-we-saw#section-samsung-display-s-claw-like-foldable">showcasing its Flex G and Flex S designs;</a> these are foldable panels that look like what its future tri-folding and multi-folding devices would look like. The company also showcased a claw-like foldable that could close vertically, leaving a sliver of screen at the center.</p>

<p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei's Mate XT</a> has been ruling the tri-fold phone market, although we've heard significant chatter that Samsung is planning to launch its rumored multi-fold phone, reportedly dubbed the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect"> "Galaxy G Fold</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect">"</a> along with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in July this year — a Korean news site claims that this phone will go into mass production this month.</p><p>As Samsung continues to drop hints of its plans to release multi-fold phones in the future, it will be exciting to see how these patents will be conceptualized into devices.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google is working on a desktop-style Chrome for Android with extension support, something mobile Chrome has been missing.</li><li>This new version is designed for larger Android devices like Chromebooks, and it’s a big step toward closing the gap between mobile and desktop browsing.</li><li>It’s still a bit rough—no easy way to manage extensions, no toolbar button, and installing them isn’t as smooth as on desktop.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is apparently working on a unique version of Chrome for Android with a full-fledged desktop-style interface. This version stands out by finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-how-google-could-safely-bring-extensions-chrome-android">bringing browser extension support</a>, something the current mobile Chrome completely lacks.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> might be huge on Android, but it has always lagged behind its desktop version, especially when it comes to extensions. Now, Google is working on changing that with a desktop-class Chrome for Android, finally bringing extension support into the mix, as per Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/chrome-for-android-with-extensions-demo-3540132/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>.</p><p>Thanks to a recent code tweak, users can now manually install extensions by simply dragging and dropping .crx files into the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="built-for-big-screens-2">Built for big screens</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:70.70%;"><img id="SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC" name="browser-extension-support-Chrome-Android" alt="browser extension support for Chrome on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvXNPCUcg5kuHJc9pXdMEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="707" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>True to its name and the reports from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/desktop-chrome-android-extensions-3488455/" target="_blank">late 2024</a>, the Desktop Android version of Chrome is built to bring the browser’s core features to large-screen Android devices, including Chromebooks and other computers. With Chrome OS on its way out, a solid replacement is more important than ever.</p><p>Rahman has been putting these test Chrome builds through their paces, and the results speak for themselves. He's already got extensions like Dark Reader, Keepa, and uBlock Origin up and running, proving that an Android-based Chrome can fully support extensions.</p><p>Despite the progress, there are still a few hiccups. For one, users can’t access extension settings yet, and there’s no toolbar button to easily toggle extensions. Additionally, without a Chrome Web Store equivalent for Android, installing extensions still feels a bit basic. It works, but it's definitely not polished.</p><p>It appears that Google is currently putting all its energy into just making extensions work at all. So, to check on or manage your extensions, you'll need to head straight to the chrome://extensions page.</p>
<h2 id="regular-phones-don-t-hold-your-breath-2">Regular phones? Don’t hold your breath</h2>
<p>Adding extension support to Chrome for Android is a big step toward matching the desktop browsing experience. Sure, it’s still a bit rough around the edges, but make no mistake: this is the foundation for something huge.</p><p>That said, these changes probably won’t lead to extensions being available on Chrome for regular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Google has purposely stayed away from adding extension support on Android, unlike Firefox and Microsoft Edge, signaling a clear strategy behind the decision.</p>

<ul><li>Qualcomm announced its new mobile platform, Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 bringing premium performance and features to mid-range flagship phones.</li><li>The new chip features a Kryo CPU and newly sliced Qualcomm Adreno GPU architecture, delivering improved performance and 3.2 GHz peak speeds.</li><li>The new chip comes packed with 31% improved CPU performance and 39% better power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Qualcomm has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.qualcomm.com/products/mobile/snapdragon/smartphones/snapdragon-8-series-mobile-platforms/snapdragon-8s-gen-4-mobile-platform#features">announced</a> the launch of its new Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 mobile platform today (April 2). This new chip is said to improve the performance of mid-tier flagship phones compared to the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3. It is specifically designed for smartphones that focus on gaming compared to the other features on the phone.</p><p>According to the chip maker's press release, the new chip features Kryo cores instead of Oryon like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip. It sports a 1+3+2+2 core configuration that claims to clock speeds at up to 3.2 GHz, which is higher than its predecessor (3.0 GHz).</p><p>Regarding the changes in its GPU, the SD 8s Gen 4 is equipped with an Adreno 825 GPU, which increases the chip's performance by 49% compared to the 8s Gen 3 (features in phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr Plus 2024</a>). This enables real-time accelerated ray tracing and global illumination, delivering improved lighting, shadows, and reflections during gameplay.</p><p>The chip is said to bring with it some of Snapdragon's elite gaming experience, "including the Qualcomm Adaptive Performance Engine and Adreno Frame Motion Engine 2.0." This will, in turn, improve the user's gaming sessions without using up a lot of the device's power.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qF726a2qKpo5emef3UnEXG" name="Snapdragon-8s-Gen-4- screenshots" alt="Screenshots of SD 8s Gen4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qF726a2qKpo5emef3UnEXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Qualcomm has made significant changes to the chip's Neural Processing Unit (NPU), and its "Qualcomm AI Engine" is said to improve AI performance by 44%. This enables the chip to easily process and run multi-modal Gen AI models, much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> or ChatGPT within the phone. The chip gets 2x larger shared memory that speeds up the user's interaction with LLMs or LVMs.</p><p>This Hexagon NPU also has the intelligence to snap better pictures automatically and is now enhanced to support a 320 MP single-camera sensor, significantly higher than the 200MP on the SD 8s Gen 3.</p><p>Higher sensor support comes with better photography, including better object recognition of up to 250 different things in a single 4K image, and helps capture photos that naturally color-correct the image based on the lighting around them. Additionally, this chip will also support better nighttime photography, with Night Vision 2.0 recording ultra-low light videos at a smooth 4K30 FPS.</p>

<p>Other notable features of the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 include uninterrupted entertainment with the Snapdragon Sound Technology Suite, featuring Qualcomm aptX Audio for lossless CD-quality music, and Qualcomm's eXpanded Personal Area Network (XPAN) technology, which "keeps earbuds and headphones connected via Wi-Fi" for uninterrupted audio during intense game sessions.</p><p>Lastly, when it comes to connectivity,  the chip gets the same Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF as the SD 8s Gen 3, which is said to increase download speeds up to 4.2Gbps on any 5G network and also works on conserving the device's battery when connected to it. It comes with support for Wi-Fi 7 at up to 5.8Gbps and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a>.</p><p>According to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/qualcomm_snapdragon_8s_gen_4_announced_with_kryo_cpu_adreno_825_gpu-news-67213.php"> GSM Arena</a>, this chip is expected to debut on the iQOO Z10 Turbo and more devices from Xiaomi, Oppo, Meizu, and more.</p>

<p>Meta and UFC have joined forces as part of an expansive, multi-year partnership to make Meta products and technologies a key part of UFC, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ufc.com/news/ufc-announces-comprehensive-multiyear-partnership-with-meta" target="_blank">announced</a> today, April 2. The partnership with Meta will "leverage its leading technologies to deliver unprecedented engagement with hundreds of millions of UFC fans around the world."</p><p>Meta becomes UFC's first Official Fan Technology Partner, as well as its first Official AI Glasses Partner (Ray-Ban Meta) and Official Social Media Partner (Threads). <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> in particular will be used "in compelling ways at UFC events."

<p>Now that the partnership is official, UFC President and CEO Dana White may have more to share regarding the new Meta experiences in the future.</p><p>"I've had a lot of great partners over the years that have helped us grow this sport, but Mark and his team at Meta are going to do things that will blow away UFC fans," said White.  "Meta has the greatest minds in tech and they are going to take fan engagement to the next level.  We've already started to work on some innovations with Meta around a new fighter rankings system that I'll be sharing soon."</p><p>The financial terms of the deal were not made public, but Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and MMA fighter himself — shares White's optimism.</p><p>"I love this sport and I’m looking forward to working with the UFC to let fans experience it in new ways," said Zuckerberg.</p><p>The two companies say that additional details of the partnership will be announced in the future.</p>

I made a mockup above based on Bloomberg's description, which should give you an idea of what to expect.</p><p>But it's the sEMG band that might be the most exciting feature, as it means a proper smart device experience can be had without having to hold a smartphone all the time. It means apps can be interacted with without feeling clunky like they do on a smartwatch, and it means messages can not only be read but also easily responded to.</p><p>I previously covered <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">how sEMG bands work</a>, but the gist is that they can sense muscle movements in your hand and understand the difference between pinching your fingers together and scrolling with your thumb. The only thing that might get in the way is typing, but that's something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-gets-new-ways-to-communicate">Meta AI</a> is already very capable of doing by using your voice.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The glasses are expected to be bundled with an sEMG band, which will make it dead easy to interact with apps despite the small screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This is a huge step in the right direction for Meta as the company has struggled to release smart glasses products early enough to satisfy investors, often seeming to focus on the big picture rather than delivering smaller stepping-stone products that will get consumers interested in the concept.</p><p>The company's second pair of connected Ray-Ban glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">have been a hit</a>, with Meta ramping up production in hopes of selling as many as 10 million this year. The next obvious step is to offer a new pair with a single display that begins getting people used to looking forward at a display instead of craning their necks downward all the time.</p><p>As this display is situated in the bottom portion of the right lens, you'll have to gaze downward at least a little bit to get the clearest view. From my estimation, this is a much better design than Google Glass — the closest conceptual product I can think of — as Glass required you to look <em>up</em> to see the display. If I'm walking in a city and need to look at directions, I don't want to be looking away from the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Since these glasses are powered by Android, Bloomberg says there will be a handful of apps that ship with it but that it won't have a dedicated app store. Apps include Meta's messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Messenger, a camera app for using the upgraded cameras on the glasses, as well as a maps app for visual directions and navigation.</p><p>But while these glasses aren't prepared to replace your phone just yet, they are the gateway into augmenting the phone experience to get you less reliant on your little black mirror and more comfortable with using Meta AI and alternative forms of input. They'll still connect to your phone using the Meta View app that existing Ray-Ban Meta glasses use, but at least some of that connection won't be required now that these glasses will have onboard computing.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>These new glasses would be powered by Android and be capable of running apps on the small screen in the right lens.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>These glasses will not feature positional tracking like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> prototype or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-aria-gen-2-smart-glasses-look-like-serious-upgrade-on-ray-ban-meta">Meta Aria Gen 2</a> research glasses. Most likely, this is to help shave some of the cost off the price tag as well as provide reasonable battery life.</p><p>It's unreasonable to expect a fully-featured pair of smart glasses to somehow be light enough for comfort <em>and</em> have all-day battery life in this day and age, but that's a problem that might be solved a few years in the future.</p><p>Meta is also said to be upgrading the camera, something <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again">I'm particularly excited about</a> since I use the Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses camera all the time. The analogy was that the current camera is roughly equivalent to an iPhone 11, while the new camera will be equivalent to an iPhone 13.</p><p>This is, essentially, the start of the future Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg spoke about when he said Meta would lead the tech space into a post-smartphone era. These new Hypernova glasses are said to retail for between $1,000 and $1,400, so it'll still be a while before they're affordable enough to make a dent in the smartphone market.</p>

<p>Meta looks to be releasing several different shades this year, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">a potential Oakley-branded pair</a> known as Supernova 2 within Meta's R&D labs. These glasses will be more full-featured than Hypernova and are said to be optimized for athletic use, which makes sense given Oakley's popularity with bikers and in some other sports.</p><p>Bloomberg's report also details the existence of Hypernova 2, a follow-up to the glasses described above that would feature two displays — one in each lens. Meta is said to still be working on a fully standalone pair of smart glasses that don't rely on a connection to a phone, but those glasses — currently known as Artemis — are likely still two years away.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Samsung's Project HAEAN</a> smart glasses are said to be making a debut this year alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> XR headset. HAEAN is said to look similar to Ray-Ban Meta Smart glasses and is powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>, similar to the Google smart glasses you see in the image above.</p><p>HAEAN will likely be a direct competitor to the upcoming Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, as they reportedly feature a display in the lenses.

<ul><li>A tipster claims there's evidence in the Galaxy S24's One UI 7 beta code that points towards the possibility of Now Brief support.</li><li>Nothing works; however, the tipster was able to discover the Now Brief's official page and app options.</li><li>A Samsung exec recently stated that not every major AI feature in One UI 7 will hit older devices due to hardware limitations.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Amidst the One UI 7 anticipation, it seems a few of Samsung's older devices could receive a Galaxy S25 feature.</p><p>There's a chance Samsung could drop a version of One UI 7's Now Brief on one of its past-gen Galaxy series, at least according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906770062435889446">Mehmet Kaya on X</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-now-brief-galaxy-s23-fold-6-flip-6-more-devices/">SamMobile</a>). The rumor started after the tipster allegedly discovered the feature while searching "Activity Launcher" in the latest OS beta. The tipster states searching for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a> will bring up its respective page full of feature details, as well as its list of supported Samsung apps.</p><p>However, they add that users won't see it in action during the beta. In their thread, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MEMETCAN88/status/1906790896261067217">the tipster states</a> Samsung has "disabled it," which could indicate more work is required before it can be seen.</p><p>Another user, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/thatjoshguy69/status/1892878357009699231">That Josh Guy</a>, chimed in, stating these whispers of Now Brief for the Galaxy S24 appeared in One UI 7 Beta 4. The user states the small "traces of code" don't give a live example but only hint at its base functions and pages where users can customize it or update it. Their post states they had to go "root level deep" to even access the core of the function, which seemingly indicates the ability for the Galaxy S24 to run Now Brief.</p><p>It's not clear if Samsung plans to bring the Now Brief to the past-gen series when One UI 7 launches or</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Breaking. Now brief feature is available in s24 series. Oneui 7 beta 6 is also hidden but I've uncovered with activity launcher.@tarunvats33 @SamMobiles @theonecid @UniverseIce pic.twitter.com/uvLoHZOJAu<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906770062435889446">March 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Interestingly, the publication notes that the same code was discovered in the One UI 7 beta for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p><p>This discovery leads us back to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">a recent interview</a> with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally. During the discussion, Sally highlighted that not every One UI 7 feature will arrive for Samsung's past-gen devices. They stated major on-device processes, like the Personal Data Engine, are extremely reliant on the phone's or tablet's available hardware. As such, the engine requires Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> to operate.</p><p>Sally added that more affordable phones will likely miss out on the bulk of One UI 7's major AI features since the available hardware isn't strong enough. One question that remained was whether or not the Now Bar/Now Brief would arrive on older phones. Nothing is confirmed, but evidence of the feature <em>could </em>indicate that this specific feature isn't so hardware-reliant.</p><p>Either way, Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will arrive on April 10 in the U.S. However, its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-galaxy-dates-spotted-overseas">fully detailed rollout schedule</a> was discovered on its Czech Republic website, potentially giving us an idea of what to expect.</p>

<p>NotebookLM is an AI-powered notebook that can help you study or understand virtually anything, and it works by intaking uploaded content, called sources. These sources could be documents, notes, or webpages, and you can upload them to a NotebookLM project. Starting today, April 2, Google is automating the process with a new <strong>Discover sources</strong> feature that scours the web for source links on your behalf, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-labs/notebooklm-discover-sources/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>This functionality combines Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini's</a> ability to search the web with sourcing in NotebookLM projects. When users click the new <strong>Discover sources</strong> button in NotebookLM, they can describe the topic of their project. After that, NotebookLM takes care of the rest.</p><p>"NotebookLM gathers hundreds of potential web sources in seconds," Google explains. "It analyzes them and picks the most relevant ones based on your defined topic. It presents up to 10 source recommendations, each with an annotated summary explaining its relevance to your topic."</p><p>By checking the box for each suggested source recommendation, it will become available in your NotebookLM project, providing additional context. These sources can be used with Briefing Docs, FAQs, and Audio Overviews, and are also available for reading, note-taking, and citation purposes. On top of that, you can use the chatbot to converse with AI about the suggested sources.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> is also getting a new feature that pays homage to Google Search's famous <strong>I'm feeling lucky</strong> button. It's called <strong>I'm feeling curious</strong>, and it "generates sources on a random topic, offering a quick way for you to see the product’s source discovery agent in action."</p><p>Google says the Discover sources feature is "the first of a series of NotebookLM features that uses the power of Gemini to find and collect relevant sources for your notebook."</p><p>The tool will be available to all NotebookLM users, on free and paid tiers, and is rolling out starting today. It could take a week for all users to gain access to the feature.</p>

<p>Similar to how Google has worked to bring more AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/samsung-lenovo-debut-chromebooks-google-update-details">to the Chromebook Plus</a>, MediaTek states it has done the same in tandem with the former. Adam King adds, "We worked closely with Google to ensure the newest Chromebook Plus devices enjoy next-generation on-device AI capabilities, superior performance per watt, and immersive multimedia.”</p><p>The Taiwanese OEM announced it has integrated 50 TOPS NPU for "greater" on-device generative AI processes. This 8th-generation NPU also brings personalized computing capabilities, "seamless" AI-enhanced workflows, and more. Future consumers can also expect quicker local processing speeds, security, efficiency, and AI workload support even without a Wi-Fi connection.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's VP and GM for ChromeOS and Google for Education, John Solomon, said, "We're excited for the next step in our MediaTek partnership." Solomon states this new venture will open up "new avenues for on-device AI" while also delivering "awesome power efficiency" when users are on the go.</p>

<hr>
<p>New information regarding a year-old rumor about a Find My Device update may suggest an impending launch.</p><p>X tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/find-my-device-uwb-3540807/">Android Authority</a> went through a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/ask-jerry-which-earbuds-support-google-find-my-device-network-2024">Find My Device</a> app update, which holds more clues about its supposed UWB update. One of the highlights in Google's newly uploaded code/content includes a UWB function animation. The tipster was able to view this short clip, which will allegedly direct users on how to hold their phone to relocate lost devices.</p><p>The feature seems to prefer to be held more upright or slightly tilted back; however, holding your phone more landscape will interfere with its UWB relocator.</p><p>Meanwhile, v3.1.305-1 of the app has reportedly received extra bits of code as Google progresses with the feature. The post highlights the existence of the UWB-powered scanning dubbed "precision_finding" in the app. Here, the code gives more info behind that early demo video, stating you should "hold your phone straight up and try moving around." This will supposedly aid in its accuracy.</p><p>Interestingly, the early strings of code state the feature might rely on your room's lighting situation. One string states, "more light needed to find the device."</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ar-directions-uwb-find-my-device">of UWB support</a> headed for the Find My Device app started in early June 2024. Code from almost a year ago echoes what we've seen today, at least regarding its name: "precision finding." There wasn't much else back then when compared to what Google has added to the app's code recently. However, it seems the company has plans to implement more AR-based directions, too.</p><p>Last year's discovery showcased how the app could use AR technology to direct users on-screen to where their UWB-supported tracker/device is. More concrete details on its complete functions aren't known yet, but it seems Google hasn't dropped this idea.</p><p>The Find My Device app has been relatively quiet, aside from a recent update that brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-find-my-device-app-people-tab-update-rollout">a new "People" tab</a>. From the new page, users can easily share their current location with "trusted contacts." The feature mirrors what you'd find in Google Maps as your family or friends will see your profile picture, name, location (address), and device battery. This feature was mentioned in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">Google's March feature drop</a>, but it just started rolling out two weeks after its initial highlight.</p>

But instead of taking down these videos or accounts linked to them, it is demonetizing these channels.</p><p>You've likely scrolled through YouTube and encountered clickbait movie trailers that promise a surprise Marvel sequel or the trailer for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child with a cover picture showcasing Daniel Radcliffe as the lead. But these genuine-looking trailers are nothing but fake videos edited to seem real. Now, with the help of AI, it has become much easier to simply give it a prompt and see the magic happen.</p><p>According to a report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/youtube-ad-revenue-fake-movie-trailer-screen-culture-1236354143/">Deadline</a>, YouTube has turned off the ability for two major fake movie trailer accounts to monetize their videos, which have been seemingly created with the help of AI. The accounts in concern are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@ScreenCultureOfficial">Screen Culture</a> and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kh+studio"> KH Studio</a> trailers which have over two million subscribers combined.</p>

<p>Screen Culture, which has over 1.4 million subscribers, is notorious for creating conceptual fan trailers of movies that look like the real deal. In the recent past, the account has been leveraging AI to create scenarios with existing footage from old movies and mashing it up with new AI footage to create fake trailers.</p><p>KH Studios, with nearly 700K subscribers, creates trailers based on imagined movies and "what if" scenarios. For example, they've created trailers imagining Henry Cavill as the next James Bond or Leonardo DiCaprio in a Squid Game season, Deadline states.</p>

<p>Due to both channels showcasing misleading content, YouTube suspended both Screen Culture and KH Studios for violating monetization policies, and now they cannot earn ad revenue from all of their videos. While both channels can appeal to counter YouTube's decision, its highly unlikely that things will change in their favor.</p><p>YouTube's<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/1311392?hl=en"> monetization policy clearly states</a> that while creators do have freedom of speech, they should "avoid creating content that is misleading or controversial and the "video content should not be deceptive or clickbait." And both channels seem to be repeat offenders of the above.</p>

<p>While Screen Culture is yet to put out an official statement or comment on the matter, KH Studios' founder told Deadline, “I’ve been running KH Studio full-time for over three years now, putting everything into it. It’s tough to see it grouped under “misleading content” in the demonetization decision when my goal has always been to explore creative possibilities – not to misrepresent real releases,” they added.</p><p>YouTube hasn't commented on the matter yet. However, Android Central has reached out to the streaming platform and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>It looks like Samsung is all but guaranteed to bring back the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic. And while it's the right move to resurrect its signature design, this alternating system leaves a gap year for Samsung fans who care, first and foremost, about battery life.</p><p>Or, to put it more bluntly, thinking about the inevitable Classic only makes me wistful for the dead Pro lineup, and I wish the two could be merged.</p><p>This week, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/new-leak-hints-at-the-samsung-galaxy-watch-8s-existence">Galaxy Watch 8 leak</a> indicated it'll ship in its usual two case sizes, with the larger model hitting 435mAh capacity — just 10mAh more than the Watch 7 44mm. This same leak indicated there'll likely be two Watch 8 Classic models; we didn't see any battery data, but the Watch 6 Classic and 4 Classic both matched their cheaper counterparts.</p><p>A second leak indicated Samsung is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring/samsung-galaxy-ring-2-dream-batteries-rumored">all-solid-state batteries</a>, but it won't add one to a Galaxy Watch until "late 2027." While OnePlus used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-kicks-off-battery-arms-race-for-smartwatches">silicon-carbon tech</a> in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> to make it last five days, we can probably expect the usual 40-ish hours of battery life Samsung always offers.</p><p>Samsung will keep the Galaxy Watch 8 skinny and affordable, as it should. But if we're never going to see a Pro again — and with the Ultra too pricey for some — I'd like to see the Classic take after the Pro and bridge the battery gap, unlikely as that may seem.</p>

<p>I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-5-pro-review">Galaxy Watch 5 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a> the last three summers. Samsung's experimentation with new designs kept things so fresh that it gave me whiplash; I never knew what Samsung would prioritize in a given year.</p><p>I only started reviewing smartwatches regularly in 2022. After a few skinny, plastic running watches with weeks-long battery life, the 2022 Watch 5 Pro was my first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> (or traditional smartwatch, period). I was a relative newbie, in other words, and my complaints against it feel mostly off-base now.</p><p>I said the Pro "gave a whole new meaning to the word heavy." With later context, it's still not what I'd call light, but most flagship watches are trending bulkier by about half an ounce. And it earns the weight, thanks to the battery. I was being way too dramatic.</p><p>I complained that the Pro was uncomfortable for sleep tracking, not realizing yet that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smartwatch-vs-smart-ring-sleep-tracking">I hated wearing <em>any</em> smartwatch to bed</a>. I stand by my complaint about the terrible default D-Buckle Sport band, though.</p><p>I argued that there "wasn't enough difference" in performance between the Pro and Watch 5, but that's been the norm on much pricier Ultra watches because there aren't enough smartwatch chips for there to <em>be</em> any differentiation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze" name="Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-vs.-Watch-5-Pro-on-wrists.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Watch 5 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJjRWwATDCDjZs6CSKawze.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to keep wearing the Watch 5 Pro <em>now</em>: the chip is a couple of generations behind, with less RAM and a dimmer, thicker-bordered display than I'm used to these days. However, I do think that the Pro's design didn't deserve to be a one-off, and I'd be much kinder to a new version today.</p><p>My wrist has been trained for heavier watches like the Galaxy Watch Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, but growing accustomed to something doesn't mean I prefer it. Once I tried the three-day <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> last year, it reminded me that you don't need a <em>massive</em> watch<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review"> </a>for it to be long-lasting.</p><p>Man, would I love a Galaxy Watch 8 Pro with a battery to write home about, paired with three generations of upgrades. But since that may not happen, let's talk about the rumored Classic.</p>
<h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-can-be-more-than-a-pretty-face-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic can be more than a pretty face</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-apps.jpg" alt="The app list on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3tfd7js5w3hVqAtRgwv2X5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Samsung sticks to the same look as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</a> and Watch 6 Classic, I'm sure a Watch 8 Classic will remain popular with long-time fans. Samsung is oddly stubborn about adding a crown to its watches, so the Classic is our one chance to get more precise non-touch controls when navigating through tiles. And it looks great, especially the lighter case colors.</p><p>I simply wish that the Classic offered something more than a facelift. It's already quite heavy and thick thanks to the rotating bezel; to have it weigh about as much as any Ultra watch but last half as long is hard to accept, especially in an era where OnePlus has shown it's possible to stretch a Wear OS watch's battery to the limits.</p><p>Consider the report last year that a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-management-furious-latest-product-design">Samsung exec was "angry" about "design plagiarism"</a> because the Galaxy Watch Ultra looked too much like an Apple Watch Ultra. I think some of this was overblown by the media; both Ultras look very different in person. But it's fair to question whether Samsung might go back to the drawing board with a new design or scrap the Ultra.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3701px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C679DtBoDyMeLTiJWe6W5o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3701" height="2082" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I suspect the Galaxy Watch Ultra lineup isn't going anywhere, even if it's redesigned. But it leaves the Classic in an awkward position because Samsung now wants to treat extra battery life as a $650 perk, even as $300–400 rivals lap it.</p><p>In an ideal world, Samsung would alternate between the Classic in odd years and <em>both</em> the Pro and Ultra in even years, so extra battery life is a mid-range perk in a more comfortable package while the Ultra adds other bells and whistles.</p><p>But since that's not going to happen, I'll settle for another unlikely alternative: a Watch 8 Classic that splits the difference and offers a <em>slight</em> battery boost. Even one more day would be appreciated!</p><p>So, until more leaks come in that dash my hopes, I'll cross my fingers that the Watch 8 Classic brings back a little bit of the Watch 5 Pro's legacy.</p>

<hr>
<p>It is that time of the year where some Sony phone enthusiasts expect this year's flagship phone from the company, dubbed Xperia 1 VII. Ahead of the anticipated launch, a new leak reveals the device through renders and gives away some of the specs as well.</p><p>The leak comes from prominent tipster Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) in collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/sony-xperia-1-vii-cad-renders-360-degree-video/">XpertPick</a>,  has shared high-quality renders of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagship phone</a> from Sony. Going by the renders, it appears the company is sticking to the predecessor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-vi-launch">Xperia 1 VI</a>'s design for the 1 VII too.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">OK #FutureSquad... Here comes your very first look at the #Sony #Xperia1VII (360° video + crispy sharp 5K renders + dimensions)!😏Today, on behalf of new Partner XpertPick 👉🏻 https://t.co/X5rO50feYQ pic.twitter.com/PAlK0pmbw5<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907383064432435631">April 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The phone appears taller with noticeable chins at the top and bottom of the display, while the side bezels seem negligible. On the right pane, we can notice the volume rocker, textured power button, and a dedicated camera button. The back panel also includes the familiar triple camera array as seen on the previous iterations.</p><p>While there aren't any notable visual changes on the upcoming Xperia 1 VII, the publication shares additional information about the handset, like its expected specifications.</p>

<p>The handset is expected to be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite and will likely measure 161.9 x 74.5 x 8.5mm (approximately) — making it slightly thicker than the predecessor. The screen, however, is also predicted to be sporting the same 6.5-inch screen with a rumored 19.5:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Further, the device is tipped to be featuring dual front-firing speakers and, in addition, users can also expect the good-old 3.5mm audio jack, which is sort of an Xperia exclusive parameter when it comes to flagship phones.</p><p>The handset is further expected to bank on Android 15 operating system out of the box and will likely be offered with a 5000mAh battery capacity and support for 30W fast charging. Lastly, going by the predecessor launch, the Xperia 1 VII is anticipated to be released sometime in May.</p>

From biotech to future tech and everything in between, I've wanted to try it all and then break it down so I understand how it works. Even so, if you had told me 30 years ago that one day, a small handheld device would be able to create an image out of thin air and a text prompt, I wouldn't have believed it.</p><p>Yet here we are, and your phone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-io-2024-gemini-model-highlights">turn what you say into a picture through AI</a>. It's often not a great picture (and can even be a disturbing mess), but it's still a piece of machinery doing something that <em>used</em> to require a human. It still does. Technically, it requires a lot of humans to spend a lot of time.</p>

<h2 id="the-work-happens-before-you-use-it-2">The work happens before you use it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8" name="Magic-Canvas-Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024" alt="An AI-generated image of Sora from Kingdom Hearts and R2-D2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TkNeAYe9huCZSzBo5Xo3h8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Modern AI works using a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/does-pixel-5-have-neural-core-chip" target="_blank">neural network</a>. You might recognize that the word neural means related to the nervous system, and that's not accidental. Computers aren't organic and don't have a nervous system, but they can mimic the process and function in their own way. That's where everything starts: with a convolutional neural network.</p><p>These specialize in the ability to recognize patterns and objects — not in the same way we do, but in a way that's almost as cool, even if not nearly as complex as a human eye and brain.</p><p>You don't remember an exact replica of everything you've ever learned or can recognize. You know a shirt is a shirt regardless of what color it is, for example, because your brain knows what a shirt is; you don't have to see every shirt in the world to recognize one.</p><p>AI does something similar. It's trained from processing hundreds of millions of images, each with a description stating exactly what the image is. Take this one, for example:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi" name="cheeseburger" alt="A photo of a cheeseburger and fries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnseqCfB4Dh37ekFgoqbTi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a cheeseburger and a side of fries. But it can be described in much more detail:</p><p><em>This is a photograph of food. It has a cheeseburger with two pieces of bacon and Swiss cheese, and a bun that looks moist. There are visible grill lines on the meat patty, and some of the meat patty's juices have soaked into the bun. There is also a wire basket that is a replica of a deep fryer basket holding at least 13 pieces of what look to be sliced potatoes. They have been fried, and at least one of them is slightly burned.</em></p><p><em>On a different, smaller plate are the remnants of an unknown appetizer with a small dish of unmelted butter in the center. There is also a small square plate with a fork and knife laid on it and a goblet off to the side filled partially with an unknown liquid. The tabletop is brown wood and there are reflections of red and yellow light near the top.</em></p><p>This is how images should be described as they are fed into an AI training algorithm. Every detail is analyzed, and nothing is insignificant because the computers doing the "looking" are looking for a pattern inside the visual noise of the photo.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>When training AI, every detail matters, even the seemingly insignificant ones.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Eventually the model will be able to take a prompt and recreate the right noise patterns to build an image because it has the right amount of the right kind of data. Everything in an analyzed image is relevant, not just the cheeseburger that you and I would notice.</p><p>With enough analyzed data, it can serve as a path or set of instructions to create a new image that fulfills a user request. It's not taking bits and pieces of images it has already seen and piecing them together like a puzzle; it's simply creating patterns of visual noise. With enough training, those patterns end up looking like an image.</p><p>This also explains why some models get some things really wrong. AI can only create based on what it was trained on; if you train using 100,000,000 photos of black dogs but never include a brown one, the AI can never create an image of a brown dog, no matter how you try to tell it to do so.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-fiasco-proves-ai-is-moving-too-fast-for-googleso-whats-next">Bias exists</a> because AI is trained on web data, and certain things are overrepresented while others are underrepresented. This makes its way into the results because, as we discussed, AI can only recreate what it was trained on. Ask AI to create an image of a scientist wearing a shirt with the Croatian flag and blue sneakers, and the doctor will probably be Caucasian simply because of how the training data was represented.</p><p>You could ask for an image of a black scientist with the same shirt and shoes sitting in a wheelchair, and you would likely be presented with one. Like during the training, a good description matters a lot.</p>
<p>AI will continue to get better, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-image-3-custom-gems-update-detailed">image generation</a> will be part of it. Researchers have plenty of hurdles, not only with fine-tuning an algorithm and using representative data but also trying to ethically work around inherent bias and incomplete training data.</p><p>We've come a long way in just a few years, and things do not look to be slowing down anytime soon.</p>

<ul><li>A Korean report hints that Samsung is delaying the Galaxy S25 Edge launch from April to May or June due to internal changes.</li><li>The device is noted for its slim design, measuring 5.8mm in thickness, with a 6.7-inch display and Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy processor.</li><li>The device is also rumored to be coming in Sliver, Black, and Blue, and offered with 256GB and 512GB storage options.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Only a day after we reported that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge could launch on April 15, new reports of its delayed launch have sprouted.</p><p>The latest Korean report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250402000203">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-launch-postponed-report/">SamMobile</a>) notes that Samsung might be halting the release of the anticipated <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>. It was initially tipped to be releasing in April but now it could probably happen only in May or June.</p><p>The report further noted that the Korean tech giant has indicated the same launch information to the telecom operators who are believed to be selling the upcoming Edge phone to the consumers in Korea.</p>

<p>The initial launch date according to the Korean report has been set for April 15 — the same date was set for Europe release as well, according to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/looks-like-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-could-launch-in-two-weeks?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dhtwitter&utm_content=null">Netherland-based report</a>. However, while the specific reason for the launch postponement is still unclear, the re-adjustment of the launch date wasn't due to quality concerns but rather due to some internal changes, that happened in the Samsung team, especially in the business department.</p><p>Meanwhile, another reliable tipster Ice Universe on X has also shared the same news of postponement in his latest X post.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What I want to say is this bad news: the release of Samsung S25 edge has been postponed. It was originally scheduled to be released on the 15th of this month, but now it has been postponed to May or June.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1907313487283728552">April 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is a highly anticipated device launch of this year, and there seem to be various takeaways for the device even before it is released to the masses. It is one of the slimmest devices that Samsung has ever made, which translates to measuring 5.8mm in thickness.</p><p>The display, however, is expected to be the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> measuring 6.7 inches. Underneath, the S25 Edge is likely powered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> same as the flagship trio.</p><p>The device is also expected to come in three colorways — Sliver, Black, and Blue. The ultra slim phone is also touted to be coming in 256GB and 512GB storage options and further have at least 12GB of RAM. Ahead of the launch, we also got to see a good look at how the device would look like in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants">recent renders</a> that showed up on the web.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is here, bringing both a base model and a Plus version into the mix. Sticking with their Fan Edition lineup, these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">mid-range tablets</a> aim to offer solid bang for your buck, much like last year’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-fe-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S9 FE</a> series.</p><p>The big upgrades are a larger display and some built-in AI smarts. Powered by Samsung’s Exynos 1580, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series is a step-up from its predecessors in terms of AI capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="ai-upgrades-2">AI upgrades</h2>
<p>You’re getting Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> for quick info on the fly, smarter Samsung Notes that can solve math problems and clean up your handwriting, and upgraded editing tools like an improved Object Eraser and the new Best Face feature.</p><p>There’s also Auto Trim for effortless video highlights and a dedicated Galaxy AI Hot Key on the Book Cover Keyboard for instant AI access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.60%;"><img id="ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-Book-Cover-Keyboard-Slim" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE Book Cover Keyboard Slim in black" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ad2EhdDFPHQ5PSwKkbE9mG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3132" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from those AI perks, the Galaxy Tab S10 FE series sticks to pretty standard specs.</p><p>Samsung is playing it safe with the Tab S10 FE’s design. You’re looking at the same aluminum body, chunky bezels, and a magnetic S Pen snap-on from previous models.</p>
<h2 id="the-cameras-are-kinda-meh-2">The cameras are kinda meh</h2>
<p>The Tab S10 FE Plus dials it back to just a 13MP rear camera, dropping the 8MP ultrawide from the previous version. Up front, it gets a 12MP camera for selfies or video calls.</p><p>The Plus model also steps it up with a massive 13.1-inch display, which is 12% bigger than before, making it the largest FE tablet yet. It sticks with an IPS LCD panel, which is pretty standard for mid-range tablets, though it won’t match the deep contrast and brightness of those high-end OLED screens.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR" name="Galaxy-Tab-S10-FE-silver-screen-and-back-panel" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 FE screen and rear panel in silver" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oJGWFSAmNHeGYcRbCrroAR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4500" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Tab S10 FE sticks with the same 10.9-inch screen as last year’s model. At least the screen is clean, with no notches or pinholes messing up your view.</p><p>Both models rock a 90Hz refresh rate and pack Vision Booster tech for better clarity in bright lighting. On top of that, they come with Samsung Knox security and an IP68 rating, meaning they’re built to handle dust, water, and whatever life throws at them.</p><p>The Plus model packs a 10,090mAh battery, which should pair nicely with the Exynos 1580 for solid power efficiency. The regular Tab S10 FE gets an 8,000mAh battery, which is not too shabby either, and likely good for all-day use without hunting for a charger.</p>

<p>Both models support 45W wired charging, so you won’t be stuck waiting forever to power back up.</p><p>Samsung says the tablets arrive on April 10 and will come in three colors: Gray, Silver, and Blue.</p>

<p>Recycling designs is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-tired-of-buying-new-cases">same complaint</a> that I've had with the Galaxy Z Fold series over the past three iterations. Minor changes here and there, but really, it's nothing more than just swapping out the chip. All the while, it continues to charge the same amount and points the finger elsewhere to deflect the blame and explain why we're still being charged so much.</p><p>This imaginary line in the sand is where Google apparently decided to step back from. In addition to sharing some renders and specs, we also learned that Google is reportedly considering dropping its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> to a "lower price point." This, I would argue, is the correct move to make, especially if the only notable change is an upgrade to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a>.</p>

<p>For one, we don't actually know how much of an upgrade this G5 will be over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> found in 2024's crop of Google flagships. More importantly (to me at least), it also appears that we may get the same cameras again, which puts me back in the "disappointed" column.</p><p>Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras</a>, especially the Galaxy Z Fold 6. But the problem is that they aren't the "best" that you can get in a Pixel, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">9 Pro XL</a> is equipped with newer and better hardware than its foldable brethren.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-5.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold rear camera module" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmKvsVuJfCQVN3E3GTSyy5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google claims this decision was made to make the 9 Pro Fold as thin as possible. Since the camera bar was replaced with an island, the sensors were just too large for what Google set out to achieve. That being said, I'm still holding out hope that the 10 Pro Fold will at least include an upgraded telephoto lens.</p><p>However, the only reason why I'm not immediately writing off the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for pulling the same crap that Samsung and Apple do is because of the price. We haven't seen or heard specifics yet, and nothing is confirmed until the official launch (so take the latest rumors with a grain of salt), but Google finds itself in a rather unique position.</p><p>It's just Google against Samsung, as OnePlus opted against releasing a rebranded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO Find N5</a>. Meanwhile, Motorola remains focused on challenging Samsung's Z Flip line, forgoing the book-style foldable.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-8.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHwsGURjW4rscnmmvEzM24.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1405" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If these rumors and renders prove to be real, Google could surprise us all by releasing the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for around $1,500. At least, that's the logical price that comes to mind, as it's usually what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thats-not-a-typo-this-google-pixel-9-pro-deal-from-amazon-makes-black-friday-look-like-a-joke">9 Pro Fold is discounted</a> to when it's on sale. But what if Google went through its entire announcement presentation, and on the last slide, we see "$1,299" for the 10 Pro Fold?</p><p>Is it realistic? No. Is it possible? Oh, it's definitely possible. It's just a matter of profit margins for Google's bottom line. But it would simply be incredible if we ended up with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold being priced the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. And Samsung would never see it coming.</p>

Now, as companies like Google and Apple try to compete, they're starting way behind OpenAI, at least in the eyes of the public. Just how big of a head start does OpenAI have? As of March 2025, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-could-be-set-as-default-assistant">ChatGPT</a> has 700 million monthly active users, which is a staggering total.</p><p>That doesn't mean Google is powerless in the fight against OpenAI for the bulk of consumer-grade AI market share. In the years since ChatGPT was released, Google ramped up AI development first through Bard, later renamed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. While OpenAI's plan to monetize ChatGPT involved making a bunch of early features free and locking advanced ones behind a paywall, Google is doing the opposite.</p><p>With Gemini, Google is almost exclusively developing new features for its paid Gemini Advanced tier, but that doesn't tell the whole story. Those features start out exclusive to the Google One AI Premium plan, which costs $20 per month, but they don't stay there for long. In the case of the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model</a>, it only remained a Gemini Advanced perk for a mere four days before going free.</p><p>So, what does this tell us about Google's AI strategy, and is it even worth paying for Gemini Advanced anymore?</p>

<h2 id="why-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-is-already-available-for-free-users-2">Why Gemini 2.5 Pro (Exp) is already available for free users</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ChatGPT has a massive brand advantage over Gemini, to the point that some casual users refer to AI as a whole as just "ChatGPT." However, Google has had the technological edge over OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) for some time now. It's releasing new models at a steady bi-annual pace — sometimes quicker — and Google's latest Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental model is the highest-scoring in multiple AI benchmarks.</p><p>LMArena, a multifaceted AI benchmark, has Gemini 2.5 Pro ranking first on its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank"> leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>. Google called it the company's "most intelligent AI model" in its announcement of Gemini 2.5 Pro last week, and independent tests appear to back up those claims.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.13%;"><img id="jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX" name="Gemini-2.5-Benchmarks" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jT62sfundccz4jwMuZZwWX.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="2556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That leads us to why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-gifting-its-best-ai-model-yet-gemini-2-5-pro-exp-to-free-users">Google decided to make Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free</a> on March 29, just four days after it debuted on March 25. To truly take on ChatGPT, Google can't just convince new users to regularly use Gemini. It also has to try and entice current ChatGPT users to switch to Gemini, and the best way to do that isn't to limit the free tier to outdated models — it's to get the absolute best Gemini models in the hands of the most people.</p><p>Although some Gemini Advanced users may have been caught off guard by the short exclusivity period, Google confirmed this is exactly why it made Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free in a social media post.</p><p>"The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/GeminiApp/status/1906131622736679332" target="_blank">post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> on the Gemini app account. "Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Gemini 2.5 Pro is taking off 🚀🚀🚀

The team is sprinting, TPUs are running hot, and we want to get our most intelligent model into more people’s hands asap.

Which is why we decided to roll out Gemini 2.5 Pro (experimental) to all Gemini users, beginning today.

Try it at no… https://t.co/eqCJwwVhXJ<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1906131622736679332">March 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Google's move regarding Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental might seem like a one-off, until you look at past examples of Gemini Advanced features going free. In recent months, numerous paid features have made their way to free users, including Gems — custom versions of Gemini catered to specific tasks. As of March 2025, free users can create their own custom Gemini bots or use pre-made Gems.</p><p>This example is quite important, since it directly challenges OpenAI's custom GPTs. Custom GPTs work similarly to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-let-you-share-custom-gems-for-gemini-in-the-mobile-app">Gemini Gems</a>, as they are custom chatbots designed to suit a specific need. However, free ChatGPT users can only try out existing custom GPTs — they can't create their own. Meanwhile, we know that Google is offering similar functionality completely free with Gemini.</p><p>The list of paid Gemini Advanced features made available to free users includes document upload and analysis, image generation of people, Deep Research, and Saved info. Once again, it's worth noting that ChatGPT's version of Deep Research isn't free, potentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deep-research-could-be-the-next-gemini-feature-to-hit-free-users-per-report">making the Gemini equivalent a more appealing option</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B" name="lenovo-chromebook-duet-11-review-13.jpg" alt="Google Gemini app on Lenovo Chromebook Duet 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n7fwxQaHoVkMWiPGLvob7B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's strategy regarding Gemini is clear: the company wants to deliver more free features than its competitors, all while embedding AI into its existing services — like Google Search, Android, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/march-2025-workspace-feature-drop">Workspace</a>, and YouTube — to gain a competitive edge. But where does that leave Gemini Advanced subscribers?</p><p>Surprisingly, there are still plenty of reasons to subscribe to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a> for Gemini Advanced access. For starters, Advanced users won't hit rate limits as early as free users. Even if the same models are available to free and paid accounts, Gemini Advanced users will get higher token counts for a larger context window.</p><p>With Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental, paying customers get a one-million-token context window that will expand to two million in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX" name="Gemini-Pro-tokens.jpg" alt="Google Gemini Pro's new token count" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vYerT9fwUABbyeubwDRcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A key perk of Gemini Advanced is the higher token support. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That's in addition to all the other Gemini Advanced features that are still exclusive to the subscription, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-guide-ai-hosts-business-pilot-program">NotebookLM</a> — one of the most powerful AI note-taking and research tools available. The same goes for Gemini Live with screen sharing and live video streaming, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-rolling-out-video-and-screen-sharing-support-for-gemini-live">rolling out to supported Android devices now</a>.</p><p>Google's shocking move of making Gemini 2.5 Pro experimental free just days after its release underscores how important Gemini's unpaid tier is to the company's AI strategy. Somehow, it doesn't come at the expense of Gemini Advanced, either.</p>
