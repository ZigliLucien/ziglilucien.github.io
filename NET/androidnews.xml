                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The latest trend in portable storage is stick SSDs; drives that look like regular USB drives, but house an internal SSD. Doing so gives these drives the ability to transfer content at 1,000MB/s — 10 times higher than normal drives. I used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/storage/teamgroup-x1-max-most-versatile-ssd-ever">Teamgroup's X1 Max</a> over the last six months, and it transformed how easy it is to access large amounts of data on the go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4bpdogFgFnDcxsEwPZmRLC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4bpdogFgFnDcxsEwPZmRLC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seagate is now getting in on the action with the Ultra Compact SSD; as you can guess by the name, the SSD is designed to be portable, and it looks just like a regular flash drive — albeit a little taller than usual. It is available with 1TB of storage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Compact-External-Solid-State/dp/B0DJ9J4BNG">for just $84</a>, and I'm using the 2TB model, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Ultra-Compact-External-Solid-State/dp/B0DJ9K1QSY">comes in at $149</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="zgLxjVAwngk7tYBvehmxMC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zgLxjVAwngk7tYBvehmxMC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The SSD is considerably smaller than most regular external SSDs like Samsung's T7 and Crucial X10 Pro, and the cable-free design makes it easy to use anywhere. The drive connects through USB-C, and I didn't have any issues using it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>. I also plugged it into my Windows machine to transfer data from the internal SSD, and I routinely saw transfers of 910MB/s.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="THSx3yTcBpZT7LCRW2daRC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/THSx3yTcBpZT7LCRW2daRC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive tends to get a little hot with extended transfers, but this hasn't been a problem as such in the month I used it. Coming in at just 24g, it's effortless to carry, and Seagate bundles a protective sleeve made out of silicone that does a good job safeguarding the drive itself and the USB-C connector. The drive gets IP54 dust and water resistance, but that's only when you use the protective sleeve.</p>

<p>There's also a lanyard that lets you attach the drive to a keyring, and the diminutive size combined with great build quality makes this a strong contender if you need rugged portable storage. On that note, the chassis itself is made out of aluminum, with Seagate using 35% recycled materials in the construction.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sFm5VLdS8JreJSvbagkvPC" name="Seagate Ultra Compact SSD" alt="Seagate's Ultra Compact SSD against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sFm5VLdS8JreJSvbagkvPC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The USB-C port is based on the USB 3.2 Gen 2 standard, and it has a 10Gbps bandwidth. You get a tiny LED that serves as the status indicator, and I didn't have any problems with the drive in daily use. It showed up immediately on Windows, Android, iOS, and my iPads, and moving data was a breeze. The only issue is that there's no password protection — that's still an area where Samsung's SSDs have an inherent advantage.</p>

<p>I find stick SSDs to be less of a hassle to use with phones than traditional external SSDs (no cables to go missing), and Seagate did a great job overall with the Ultra Compact. It is small enough to take anywhere, plugs into any USB-C device without a problem, and has ultra-fast transfers. So if you need to extend the storage of your phone or just want a reliable external SSD to back up data on the go, Seagate's Ultra Compact is a terrific choice.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is rolling out new updates to a few of its  Galaxy Watch models this week across regions, including Korea and the U.S.</p><p>In its April update, the Korean OEM seems to have snuck in a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/29/samsung-galaxy-watch-update-april-2025/">9to5Google</a>) March security patch as well. The update first started rolling out for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Ultra</a> model <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/10/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-ultra-april-2025-update/">early last month</a>; however, it now appears to be a wider rollout as it is reaching older Galaxy Watch models for regions starting with Korea and also in the U.S.</p>

As the update just began the roll out, it is expected to reach more regions in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>In other Galaxy Watch news, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/new-leak-suggests-samsungs-galaxy-watch-ultra-2-could-launch-this-summer">new leak</a> has shared some information on what to expect from the next Ultra smartwatch from Samsung. Tentatively named Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, it is tipped to be launching alongside the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldables</a> — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Fold 7</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> — with the Unpacked event likely happening in July. The leak has further mentioned that there won’t be any significant changes when it comes to the Ultra watch design and pricing.</p><p>However, the leak has also indicated that some notable changes can be seen when it comes to storage space — more of it is expected on the Ultra 2, and a new interface reminiscent of One UI 7 will also likely be included. With improved storage and perhaps a more user-friendly UI, the smartwatch might sport the same squircle look as the Galaxy Watch Ultra.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-7">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung has finally confirmed the tri-fold phone is happening, with a potential late 2025 release.</li><li>In its Q1 2025 earnings call, Samsung credited its foldable lead to constant innovation and teased even more exciting updates this year.</li><li>The Galaxy G Fold might feature a 9.9-inch screen, a major upgrade over the 7.6-inch display on the Z Fold 6.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After a long stretch of rumors and guesswork, Samsung has finally given a not-so-subtle nod that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">tri-fold phone is actually happening</a>. If its timing lines up, we could see it land sometime in late 2025.</p><p>In Samsung’s Q1 2025 earnings<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-q1-2023-earnings"> call</a>, the South Korean tech giant credited its lead in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone segment</a> to nonstop innovation and hinted at even more fresh ideas coming this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-hints-at-2025-launch-for-its-long-rumored-tri-fold-device/" target="_blank">SammyGuru</a>). The goal is to boost its edge and get foldables into more hands by showing people what the tech can truly do.</p><p>It’s been a while since Samsung dropped a phone with a brand-new form factor, the last one being way back in 2020. So, it’s fair to say we’re overdue for something fresh. Right now, all signs point to the tri-fold design being the next big thing in its lineup.</p><p>Samsung has been stuck in a bit of a form factor loop since 2020, when the OG Galaxy Z Flip brought some fresh clamshell experience to pair with the book-style Fold. Since then, it has been all about yearly touch-ups.</p>
<h2 id="we-re-way-overdue-for-something-new-2">We’re way overdue for something new</h2>
<p>But now, with no word around any other wild new designs, the tri-fold is looking like the next bold move the company is lining up.</p><p>The tri-fold rumor has been floating around for years, but earlier this year, Samsung gave it some teeth. When it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/did-samsung-just-tell-us-a-tri-fold-phone-is-coming-soon">showed off a sneak peek of what’s coming</a>, one device looked like a tri-fold phone, and it finally turned all that chatter into something real.</p><p>Samsung also mentioned that foldables will bring “large-screen experiences for Fold,” which might be a subtle nod to the rumored 9.9-inch screen on the upcoming Galaxy G Fold. If true, that’s a big jump from the 7.6-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 display</a>.</p><p>During the earnings call, Samsung was asked about its foldable strategy, and the company made it clear it's all about boosting competitiveness through form factor innovation.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a potential catch, though, with reports suggesting the Galaxy G Fold might only launch in China and Korea. If that’s the case, getting your hands on it outside those areas could be a bit of a challenge.</p><p>The initial quantity might be limited too. With this being Samsung’s first dive into the world of multi-fold phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-g-fold-could-come-sooner-than-you-expect">early talk points to it kicking things off with around 200,000 units</a>.</p><p>It’s a pretty calculated move to see how people react to this brand-new phone design. Since this is a totally fresh form factor for the company, it's keeping the first batch small and only releasing it in a few markets.</p>

<p>For years, the word "emulation" has been synonymous with "piracy." It doesn't help when you have bad actors leaking games before they're even released, only for others to livestream those same games, while telling people how to also illegally obtain the necessary files.</p><p>But for me, retro gaming and emulation are so much more than just seeing someone try and "stick it to the man." This is a topic that I could probably write enough to fill a short novel, but I won't be doing that here. Instead, I picked four reasons why being able to play a game from 1985 in 2025 is so important to me.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I didn't really dive deep into gaming until about 10 years ago or so. I would go through phases when I was addicted to heading over to a friend's house with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/we-need-more-accessories-like-the-new-backbone-one-xbox-edition">Xbox</a> to have a Halo LAN party. Which later transformed into playing Call of Duty with friends for countless hours. But for the most part, I just enjoyed going outside, touching grass, and playing sports.</p><p>To this day, there's nothing quite like being able to fire up Super Mario Bros. for the millionth time or Link's Awakening DX on one of my retro <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handhelds</a>. And if I'm in a particularly foul mood, there's always The Lion King for the Sega Genesis, which I've still never actually beaten.</p>

<p>It's crazy to think about the number of classic games that are now just a couple of taps away. There are literally thousands upon thousands of games that can be stored and played from the slab of glass in your pocket. Of course, it doesn't feel exactly the same compared to playing on the original hardware. But there are things you can do to replicate the feeling of a CRT, as long as you're willing to spend some time tinkering.</p>

<p>Throughout the years, my family primarily stuck to Nintendo and Microsoft, with a bit of Sega thrown in the middle. The first Sony console any of us had was a PSP, and then later a PS Vita. Because of that, the only time I ever could play anything PlayStation was if I were to head over to a friend's house.</p><p>There are even some Nintendo consoles that I missed out on, such as the 3DS, GameCube, Wii, and Wii U. There are a whole lot of incredible games that I didn't get to enjoy firsthand. But now, all it takes is a few taps on my phone, and I'm piloting an X-wing alongside Luke Skywalker as part of Rogue Squadron.</p>

<p>Thanks to emulation, I'm able to dive into the library of PS1, PS2, and PS3 games that I never had the chance to play before. And until recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation on Android</a> was thought to be a pipe dream. That's no longer the case courtesy of RPCS3-Android, which has been merged into a newer RPCSX project.</p><p>If you had told me that I would be able to play PS3 games on a smartphone with an almost 8-inch screen that folds in half, I would've thought you lost your marbles. But that's exactly what I'm able to do, and it's just absolutely mind-boggling and incredible.</p>

<p>Whenever I get my hands on a new Android device, one of the first things I do after the initial setup process is load up a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a> and ROMs. Switch is usually first, as that gives me a pretty good idea of what to expect right out of the box. But that's only part of the fun.</p><p>For example, say you picked up something like the AYN Odin 2 or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">AYANEO Pocket S</a>, and your favorite Switch game isn't running as smoothly as you'd have expected. Well, before giving up the goose entirely, there's actually quite a bit of tinkering that you can do.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZMXNGqG8sPRZfMtWhentvP" name="ayaneo-pocket-s-review-11.jpg" alt="AYN Odin 2 and Odin 2 Mini with Ayaneo Pocket S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZMXNGqG8sPRZfMtWhentvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To start, play around with the different settings and options that are built into the emulator you're using. The most common culprits are changing the Accuracy Level, turning off VSync, making sure that Docked Mode is enabled, etc. If you go through everything and only see marginal improvements, you're still not out of luck.</p><p>That's where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers">Turnip drivers</a> come into play, as these are custom-tuned drivers for the built-in GPU on your device. The problem here is that just because a new driver is available, it doesn't necessarily mean that it will actually resolve your issue. So I always recommend trying out a bunch of different drivers until the game is running the way you hoped.</p><p>Even then, there are limitations, as Turnip drivers are only compatible with Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered devices. When it comes to MediaTek, Exynos, or Tensor, then you're relying on a Mali GPU, and emulators won't even let you try to use a Turnip driver with a Mali GPU. Which means, what you see is what you get.</p>

<p>In years past, the above reasons served their collective purpose as to why I've been enamored with retro gaming and emulation. However, something rather special happened almost a year and a half ago. At the time of this writing, it's been almost 450 days since I became a father.</p><p>He doesn't care one way or another about the teether in the shape of the NES controller, other than the fact that it makes his mouth feel better. Nor does he care about the Fisher Price controller that lights up and plays music, other than that it makes noise.</p><p>But more recently, he'll come and crawl up next to me on the couch while I'm playing some Pokémon Ruby on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/times-running-out-on-these-prime-day-gaming-handheld-deals">RG35XX SP</a> or Wind Waker on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/heres-why-im-getting-the-retroid-pocket-flip-2-and-the-pocket-classic">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a>. Sure, part of it's the vibrant colors that draw him in, but he also just seems genuinely interested in whatever's happening.</p>

<p>To that end, while I don't want him to grow up any faster (seriously, how has it been 14+ months already?), I also can't wait to introduce him to some of the games that I played. But instead of being huddled around the family CRT, we can sit back and enjoy games on TVs that are much larger, much thinner, and won't have to worry about neck pain.</p><p>For the record, I've already started mentally planning how I'll get everything set up. But knowing me, I'll go through a million ideas first, only to figure out a way to connect a handheld, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a>, or my phone to a CRT TV.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-5g-advanced-2">What is 5G Advanced?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VdsLucrbnzL8i9uPFpzBKo" name="t-mobile-5g_2.jpg" alt="T Mobile 5g" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdsLucrbnzL8i9uPFpzBKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: T-Mobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Are you ready for 5G Advanced? Do you even know if you're ready, or if you need to be? No worries, let's take a quick look at what the next generation of connectivity looks like, and if you need to start looking for a phone that uses it, the next time you buy.</p>
<p>5G Advanced is a "friendly" name given to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.3gpp.org/specifications-technologies/releases/release-18">3GPP Release 18</a> standards. It's sometimes referred to as 5.5G, and it serves as a bridge between current technology and 6G. It offers (potentially) significant improvements to network speeds, efficiency, and even the network. Yes, that's a thing, too.</p><p>It's expected to be commercially deployed (that means the network equipment is ready) by the second half of 2025. Instead of focusing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing" target="_blank">mobile broadband</a> — achieving a good connection in more places — it has been developed to enhance connectivity options for industrial IoT (Internet of Things) devices and help them become more autonomous.</p><p>You might hear people tossing the word <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/metaverse">Metaverse</a> around, too. In theory, a connection with 10 Gbps throughput and ultra-low latency can help support immersive applications, but it cannot address the existing flaws and lack of direction. It's better to think of the things it can fix on its own, like server-based AI applications, telemedicine, or learning through VR, than lumping everything together.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PTtJR9XMAtT5k5vHSkyWGb" name="meta-quest-3-meta-quest-3s-glitchy" alt="The Meta Quest 3S stacked on top of a Meta Quest 3 with a glitch filter applied to the image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTtJR9XMAtT5k5vHSkyWGb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The standards put forth by the 3GPP (you know them as the people behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/mwc-2025">Mobile World Congress</a>) provide for a few things to make this a reality: up to 10 Gbps network speeds, network latency as low as 1 millisecond, better intelligent traffic management via AI, support for 100 times more connected devices per square kilometer, and the ability to do all this while reducing energy consumption by 30%.</p><p>It's essentially the same type of promises we see year after year from phone makers, claiming that things <em>could</em> be up to X% better.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-benefit-2">How do I benefit?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nJckbVR4AmCygx5RuYtjU6" name="waymo-current-legacy-vehicles.jpg" alt="Waymo's legacy car beside its more current model." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nJckbVR4AmCygx5RuYtjU6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Waymo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Indirectly, you'll benefit if (and that's a big if) cities harness the tech to become "smart" with network-connected utilities, traffic signals, parking meters, etc. With these working as intended, they will be more convenient for us to use.</p><p>You could also save money on your bills. If everything uses 30% less power to do more, those savings could be passed on to consumers. Not only will 5G Advanced help companies meet green energy goals, but it should also lower operating costs.</p><p>It's also a really big step towards a realistic fleet of self-driving vehicles. Maybe not like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/automotive/waymo-driverless-vehicles-downtown-phoenix">Waymo</a>, but autonomous freight transport needs this kind of tech behind it if it's ever to become a reality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>5G Advanced is a big step towards better self-driving cars and can potentially save consumers money.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>More directly, it will solve problems in healthcare, especially in rural areas. A high-speed, low-latency network allows the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-glass-enterprise-edition-industry-workers-gets-upgrade/">AR equipment</a> for training, as well as a clear benefit to the telemedicine industry. Since it's not done over a wire, the equipment can also be used in emergency service vehicles for more urgent applications.</p><p>If we had this 30 years ago, I might not be in a wheelchair today. For the sake of the next generation, I hope it pans out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg" name="T-Mobile-store-logo.jpg" alt="T-Mobile store logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Mr8skv235NeD5miZHHjWGg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know this isn't exactly what you're looking for, and you're wondering if this will improve <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">your next phone </a>or if it's a specification you should look for. Seeing companies crow about their advancements, claiming how important they are without saying exactly why, doesn't help here, either.</p><p>The sad fact is that it's very unlikely that any of this makes a difference for consumer electronics outside of very niche cases. You'll be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xbox-game-streaming-app-appears-google-play-store-wishlist-it-here">stream games</a> faster if you're on a faster network with lower latency. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oculus-quest-2-v28-update-adds-120hz-wireless-pc-vr-streaming-and-more">Streaming VR</a> won't be so terrible. Your phone, though, isn't going to be any faster because the current generation of hardware doesn't<em> need</em> the network to be any faster. You can only process so much information, and having it come in faster won't change anything. One day, though.</p><p>Some companies claim to have complete U.S. coverage for 5G Advanced soon, and some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/network/t-mobile-reaches-5g-advanced-nationwide-milestone-unlocks-the-modern-wireless-network-for-consumers-businesses-and-developers">even claim to have it today</a>, when in reality, they're using numerous older standards and labeling it a "Magenta Spin." This doesn't help nearly as much as telling why this improvement is important, even if it's not going to change your phone.</p>

<p>Wear OS (aka Android Wear) and Google Glass both went public in 2014, but they had nothing to do with one another. Now, Google should show off its new AR glasses at I/O 2025 later this month. But this time, Google would be smart to make Android watches part of its XR experience. Yes, really!</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O 2025</a> starts on May 20, but Google and Samsung have been showing off Android XR demos for months, starting with the Samsung Moohan XR headset and most recently at an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">XR TED Talk</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">"Project HAEAN"</a> AR glasses that record and memorize what you see.</p><p>Google has no Wear OS panels planned for I/O, but it will hold two Android XR panels. One's focused on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-2">Android XR SDK and AI tools</a>, while the other centers on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://io.google/2025/explore/technical-session-22">building AR apps</a> by adding "3D models, stereoscopic video, and hand-tracking" to existing Android apps.</p><p>It's a reasonable bet that we'll see AR glasses tech on the I/O stage, in other words. Since I'll be attending I/O, I hope I'll finally have a chance to demo them and see how well the Gemini commands and gesture controls work.</p><p>But having watched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az5QL_NLBvg">Marques Brownlee's Android XR demo</a> and read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319528/google-android-xr-samsung-project-moohan-smart-glasses">The Verge's AR glasses demo</a>, I can already tell that no matter how well they work, voice and gesture controls alone aren't going to cut it for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a>. And Android smartwatches are the obvious backup choice.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-wearing-blue-touch-pad.jpg" alt="Using the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses touch pad" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUMGmoxyTpwcMxKj3qkVb5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I tend to use controllers when I play VR games on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 3</a>, but every time I've used hand tracking on a Quest, Apple Vision Pro, Snap Spectacles, and other XR devices, my response is usually, "Wow, this <em>almost</em> works!"</p><p>In a room that's too dark or in direct sunlight, the inside-out camera tracking will struggle to capture your hand gestures properly. In ideal lighting, with your hand always held up in the camera's view, you can pinch to select menu options with reasonable accuracy. But I still expect missed inputs and prefer the simplicity of a controller.</p><p>Now picture using these glasses <em>outdoors</em>, where these deliberate, unnatural gestures might make passersby think I'm gesturing <em>at them</em> — or just a weirdo.</p><p>Smart glasses are meant to blend in, but this is a double-edged sword; calling attention to the fact that I'm wearing tech will only bring back the "Glasshole" problem and make people uncomfortable. (Maybe they'll be called X-aRseholes?)</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="X7xSs2mib3SqyG6a6JLPJ7" name="google-glasses-ted-2025-demo-translation" alt="Samsung Project HAEAN Android XR glasses performing live translation on state at TED 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7xSs2mib3SqyG6a6JLPJ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Project HAEAN Android XR glasses demo </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gilberto Tadday / TED)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini voice commands are a more seamless fit. The demos I've seen show that Gemini can carry out actions reliably after a few seconds to process. In the multimodal Live mode, you simply point at or focus on something to have Gemini answer your question about it — no controller required.</p><p>But when it comes to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> and asking the Meta AI to take photos, I (again) only really talk to the assistant when no one's around.</p><p>Google likes the idea of people talking freely to AR glasses at any time. And sure, maybe they'll become ubiquitous so that public AI chats are socially acceptable. But if I'm on public transit, in an office, or at the grocery store, I <em>might</em> ask the occasional quiet question, but I'd much rather have a less disruptive, non-spoken alternative.</p><p>Maybe you're less concerned about societal norms than me. You'll still have to worry about ambient noise disrupting commands or accidentally triggering Gemini. And there's always a few seconds of waiting for Gemini to process your request, and trying again if Gemini gets it wrong, while tapping buttons feels more immediate.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tZtLYtFHn9XYoxmUYkeBBH" name="Meta-orion-ar-glasses-emg-wristband-press-photo.jpg" alt="Press photo of Meta's Orion EMG wristband, with the wearer making a pinching gesture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZtLYtFHn9XYoxmUYkeBBH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Meta designed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Orion AR glasses</a>, it also created an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">sEMG neural band</a> that recognizes finger gestures so you can subtly trigger actions, without vocalizing or keeping your hands in view. Meta knew this problem needed to be solved to make AR glasses more viable, at some point.</p><p>But in Google and Samsung's case, they already have ready-made wearables with input screens, gesture recognition, and other tools that'd mesh surprisingly well with smart and AR glasses.</p>
<h2 id="why-wear-os-and-android-xr-should-sync-2">Why Wear OS and Android XR should sync</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i" name="google-pixel-watch-3-google-tv-controls.jpg" alt="Google TV controls on Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUYun2bhF7fsxK5qmDnV5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We mostly use Android watches to check notifications, track workouts, and ask Assistant questions. But they can also trigger actions on other devices: Taking a photo, unlocking your phone via UWB, toggling Google TV controls, checking your Nest Doorbell feed, and so on.</p><p>Imagine if Wear OS had an Android XR mode. It could still show phone notifications, but its display (when tilted-to-wake) would mirror whichever app you have open on your glasses. Contextual actions like video playback controls, taking a photo, or pausing a Gemini Live chat would trigger immediately with a tap.</p><p>Even better, imagine if you could twist the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3</a>'s crown or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>'s rotating bezel like a scroll wheel in menus or browsers, specifically affecting whichever window you're looking at. That sounds much better than pinching and flicking your hand over and over!</p><p>Galaxy Watches support a few basic gestures like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-apple-watch-double-tap-on-galaxy-watch-6">double taps</a> and knocking, and I wonder if this could reinforce Android XR controls, offering a second source of information that you want to select or move something, even if the camera missed the input.</p>

<p>I'd generally feel more excited about AR glasses if I knew I had a tactile backup option to voice commands, even if Gemini and hand gestures are the primary, expected control schemes. The only question in my mind is whether Google can make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS</a> work as a controller.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/2025/04/a-new-samsung-patent-illustrates-android-xr-smartglasses-using-a-galaxy-ring-watch-to-navigate-the-xr-ui.html">patent site</a> spotted Samsung patents for using a smartwatch or smart ring for XR controls, though the article is painfully vague on details, except to say that the emphasis was more on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-review">Galaxy Ring</a> than the Galaxy Watch.</p><p>It's evidence, at least, that Samsung's engineers are looking for alternative XR control schemes. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a> XR headset may ship with controllers, but the eventual goal is to sell all-day smart glasses and AR glasses; those require a more subtle and consistent control scheme than gestures and commands — at least in my opinion.</p><p>I understand why Samsung's first instinct would be to use smart rings as controllers; they're seamless and don't have a separate OS to worry about. But until I hear otherwise, I'll keep arguing that Wear OS would be a better fit and more useful!</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge happens to be the most-awaited phone from the manufacturer, and it has seen a couple of delays ever since it was previewed at the Galaxy S25 series launch. While it was earlier set to launch in April, it didn’t happen, but the new leaked launch date is just a couple of weeks from now.</p><p>Tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1917673864131203234/photo/1">Evan Blass on X</a> has shared the launch date teaser of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, which is scheduled for May 13. The leaked image looks a lot like Samsung's official poster showcasing the phone sideways, also comes with a tagline “Beyond Slim” — presumably indicating it is the Galaxy S25 Edge after all. Now, it looks like the image has been taken down on the X post due to copyright issues, as seen below.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FYI pic.twitter.com/Y9frwPeIvm<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1917673864131203234">April 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Galaxy S25 Edge is the new ultra-slim phone from Samsung that has been shown off alongside the Galaxy S25 trio. It carries a sleek, lightweight design (measuring around 5.8mm in thickness) and two primary cameras instead of three as seen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> and S25 Plus models. The rear panel also looks significantly different from the trio as it sports an all-new camera visor. While the full specs of the device haven’t been announced by Samsung yet, it is expected to be powered by the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> as seen on the flagship trio.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/new-leak-shows-off-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-in-titanium-variants">leaked renders</a> of the Galaxy S25 Edge later have showcased the device in all its colorways and the supposed Titanium finish. The slim phone is expected to come in Silver, Icy Blue, and Black colorways. The other expected specs comprise a 6.7-inch QHD+ display and a 3900mAh battery capacity.</p>

<p>It is encouraging to finally look at the launch date of the Galaxy S25 Edge, which was already anticipated because the initial rumored launch date was in April, as mentioned, and was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-delays-galaxy-s25-edge-release-from-april-to-may-or-june-2025">delayed</a> due to multiple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/tech-issues-pushed-the-galaxy-s25-edges-launch">unknown reasons</a>.</p><p>The slim phones appear to be a new trend as a couple of other companies like Oppo, OnePlus, and Apple are releasing their first compact phones later this year. OnePlus is gearing up for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-the-compact-powerful-phone-is-coming-to-india-as-oneplus-13s">OnePlus 13s launch</a> in India, which is a revamped version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T from China</a>.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I tend to switch devices every other week, so I don't normally bother with a case. That's different with the iPhone 16 Pro Max and the Pixel 9 Pro XL — which I use over the course of the year — so when it comes to these two devices, I usually go with a clear or leather case.</p>
<div class="inlinegallery  inline-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cGMfy2s9EPBNAe27mHE2Cf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGMfy2s9EPBNAe27mHE2Cf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SnB9zzf3UBb8u8axbBxBDf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnB9zzf3UBb8u8axbBxBDf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div>
<p>When accessory brand Torras asked if I'd be interested in taking a look at its Ostand OAir and OFitness collection, I was interested. While I used Spigen, ESR, and Mujjo cases in the past, two things about the Torras cases stood out: an integrated kickstand at the back, and vibrant colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PJkf6H57KfDNQ2B8tSnvBf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PJkf6H57KfDNQ2B8tSnvBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The brand sent over two colors in the OFitness collection — Mint Green and Coastal Blue — along with the three color variants available in the OAir series, and having used the cases for the better part of a month now, I'll admit that they're pretty great. Although they're bulkier, I predominantly used the OAir cases because of the added protection and better colors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b4UEW6nz2ewtKRHMbabzBf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b4UEW6nz2ewtKRHMbabzBf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Torras did a great job with the color selection, and the OAir cases in particular add a vibrancy to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. The case has a textured finish at the sides that makes it easier to hold the phone, and the buttons don't interfere with tactility in any way whatsoever.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7gP4hqmGXtYDbCTbyiwxAf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gP4hqmGXtYDbCTbyiwxAf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's a metal insert over the Camera Control button, and it makes accessing the button a little harder. If anything, I see it as a net positive as I tend to launch the camera accidentally, and the cover does a good job preventing that. You'll need to press harder to adjust the zoom level using the button, but again, I find it to be easier to use the onboard viewfinder controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EagzSDTM9xyhurbZ6BU9Cf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EagzSDTM9xyhurbZ6BU9Cf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OAir case weighs 42g on its own, and when slotted into my iPhone 16 Pro Max, the overall weight was 269g. It definitely adds noticeable weight and bulk, but the upside is that you get rugged protection. The case has raised edges at the front that ensures the panel doesn't take any damage should the phone fall face-down — I tested this quite extensively, and it held up incredibly well.</p>

<p>What I like about the case is that the top and bottom sections have additional protection (Torras calls these airbags), and after a half-dozen tumbles, it did a thorough job safeguarding my phone. The back also has a raised profile over the cameras that ensures the modules don't get scratched easily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TdfbTJGFXCjUSUtYxDVECf" name="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" alt="TORRAS iPhone 16 Pro Max Ostand Case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TdfbTJGFXCjUSUtYxDVECf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get the standard cutouts at the bottom around the USB-C port and speakers, and you'll have to use a charging cable with a slender connector; I mostly use cables with built-in power meters, and I wasn't able to connect these to the phone when the case was attached.</p>

<p>The best feature on the case is the built-in kickstand; it has full 360-degree swivel, so you can adjust the angle to your needs, and it locks the phone to that position. It hides away seamlessly when not in use, and it doesn't interfere with MagSafe at all; if anything, the case has really strong magnets, and I didn't see any issues while charging the iPhone 16 Pro Max with several Qi 2 stands.</p>

<p>The OFitness case also has the same kickstand and a similar texture finish at the sides, but you miss out on the protection at the corners. These cases are lighter at 36g, and while they're not as rugged as the OAir models, they still do a good job in daily use.</p>

<p>The OFitness <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://torraslife.com/collections/iphone-16-pro-max-cases/products/ostand-fitness-for-iphone-16-pro-max">cases cost $42.99 each</a>, and if you're interested in buying the OAir cases, you'll <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://torraslife.com/products/oair-for-iphone-16-pro-max?variant=42637851951146">need to shell out $64.99</a>. That's on the higher end of the scale as these cases go, but the reliable protection combined with great color choices and built-in kickstand makes it an easy recommendation.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2024 is our top pick for the best budget foldable phone, recommended for most people looking to enter this segment. It's not too expensive considering the technology you get, and it does a fine job for most tasks. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">Motorola Razr 2025</a> is the latest refresh, arriving in early May, and it comes with some notable upgrades.</p><p>If you were considering between the Motorola Razr 2025 vs. Razr 2024, should you pay full price for the new model or save a bit and get the older one? Either way, the base Razr model is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone" target="_blank">best budget foldables</a> on the market. The 2024 model had issues with camera quality and audio from the speakers, which we're hoping have been addressed in the 2025 refresh. Let's compare the two and see what's similar and what has been improved in the new model.</p>

<p>Motorola's Razr 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-arrives-as-a-trio">will go on sale starting May 15</a>, and pre-orders will start on May 7. The new Razr comes in at the same price of $699.99 in the U.S. for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It comes in new Pantone colors called Spring Bud, Gibraltar Sea, Parfait Pink, and Lightest Sky. There should be pre-order and trade-in offers too, which can offset some of the cost. If you don't want to buy it unlocked, the Razr 2025 should also be available with all the major U.S. carriers, for a small monthly fee.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a> is still very much available, and my guess is, will be for some time. Motorola is selling it for $100 lower than the launch price at $599.99 for the singular variant with 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. The phone comes in Spritz Orange, Koala Grey, and Beach Sand. Like the 2025 model, you can buy this unlocked from all the big online retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart or via the three major carriers in the U.S..</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 is nearly impossible to tell apart from the Razr 2024 model, save for the new colors. The dimensions of both phones are virtually identical, as they have a thickness of 7.3mm and weigh 188 grams. What's not visibly apparent are the new changes made to the Razr 2025's build. The hinge now gets a titanium reinforcement, which is said to be 4x stronger than before. The new model is also IP48 rated (IPX8 on the Razr 2024), which finally adds official dust proofing, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>In principle, you <em>should</em> be able to use the same cases for the 2024 Razr on the 2025 model.</p><p>Motorola hasn't made many changes to the displays on the new Razr 2025 either. Honestly, it didn't really have to, considering the 2024 Razr had pretty epic screens for its price segment.</p><p>Both phones feature a 6.9-inch folding LTPO AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The outer display measures 3.6 inches, and it too is an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and up to 1,700 nits of peak brightness. You get Gorilla Glass Victus for the outer displays, which offers good durability.</p><p>We're yet to test the Motorola Razr 2025, but in all likelihood, the displays and ergonomics should be identical to the 2024 model. In our review of the latter, we loved the vibrancy and richness of the displays, the premium textures of the construction, and the fact that you can open apps like Google Maps directly from the outer display.</p>

<p>The Motorola Razr 2025 features a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips" target="_blank">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> SoC, which is likely to be more advanced (and more AI-capable) than the Dimensity 7300X in the Razr 2024. But if you compare the specs of both chips a bit more closely, the only real change is a 100MHz bump in CPU clock speed in the new model, while pretty much everything else is the same.</p><p>Translated, the Razr 2025 should perform nearly identically to the 2024 model in real-world app usage and probably somewhat better. We might see a minor bump in benchmark numbers, but that's about it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iVVpGJVGyrbBpc4uBFMXNZ" name="Motorola-Razr-2024-review-02.jpg" alt="The Motorola Razr 2024 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iVVpGJVGyrbBpc4uBFMXNZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What has actually improved is the battery capacity. The Razr 2025 features a larger 4,500mAh capacity compared to the 4,200mAh capacity in the Razr 2024. We were already quite happy with the Razr 2024's battery life, and we're excited that the 2025 model should fare even better.</p><p>Charging speeds have remained the same, though, at 30W wired and 15W wireless. You'll also need to buy a compatible charger from Motorola separately or choose from any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a> on the market.</p><p>The 2024 Razr didn't have stellar cameras, despite its decent specs on paper. Compared to the Razr Plus 2024, the standard Razr produced overprocessed images when shooting during the day, especially with HDR shots. The camera app was also quite sluggish at times, which really took away from the whole photography experience.</p><p>As for camera specs, both phones have nearly the same sensors on paper. There's a 50MP primary camera with an f/1.7 aperture and optical stabilization, a 13MP ultrawide with autofocus so it can take macro photos, and a 32MP selfie camera in the folding screen that's capable of 4K 30fps videos.</p><p>These were some of the things we experienced when we reviewed it back in August 2024, so we're hoping these issues have been addressed on the 2025 Razr. Pantone-validated color and skin tones for the primary camera are new additions, so we'll have to see how this translates into actual photo quality.</p>

<p>Motorola is doubling down on its AI efforts in the Razr 2025 with all-new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features. The AI suite, previously in beta, now offers features like notification summarization, recording transcripts, the ability to recall information, and lots more, via Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and Remember This.</p><p>All these features now work in tandem with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Gemini Live. The Razr 2025 ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>, and it will be getting three years of OS upgrades and four years of security patches.</p><p>The Motorola Razr 2024 shipped with Android 14, but it too is destined to get three OS upgrades, which means it will be relevant for a few more years. All of the new AI features in the 2025 model should make their way to the Razr 2024, too, considering the chipset is essentially the same. Motorola doesn't have the best track record for timely software updates, which is the only real issue here.</p>

<p>If you're looking to get yourself a new foldable phone, I'd say <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">wait for the Motorola Razr 2025</a> to go on sale and pick it over the 2024 model. You should be able to snag some pre-order offers and get the price down a bit.</p><p>The reason for opting for the latest model is simple — it costs the same, offers dustproofing, a larger battery, a stronger hinge, and the latest software. Not to mention a choice of some pretty cool new colors. Existing owners of the Razr 2024 need not upgrade to the 2025 model as there's not much to be gained.</p><p>The 2024 Razr is still a great buy at $100 less than the 2025 model. If you're not in any hurry, I'd wait for some of the big sales when Motorola drops massive price cuts on its phones. Other than the average cameras, the rest of the phone is pretty great even in 2025, and it makes an even better deal if you can find it for under $500.</p>

<p>When asked about Reality Labs' typical $4 billion in losses per quarter and whether a "light at the end of the tunnel" is coming, Zuckerberg mentioned "doing the work more efficiently," a typical Meta euphemism for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-lay-offs-strike-again-impacting-its-reality-labs-division">Reality Labs layoffs</a>.</p><p>But he also made an optimistic case that these investments laid the groundwork for a major profit boost in the near future.</p><p>"If you look at some of the leading consumer electronics products in other categories, by the time they get to their third generation, they're often selling 10 million units and scaling from there," Zuckerberg said.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Their goal is to scale to that level and then "scaling beyond that for the generations after that," which matches <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">Zuckerberg's vision of "billions of AI glasses"</a> in the next "five to ten years."</p><p>The Meta Quest 3 and 3S are well beyond third-generation if you take Oculus Rift and Go into account. So when Zuckerberg refers to a third-gen boost, he likely means Ray-Ban Meta 3 glasses, aka the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Hypernova AR glasses</a> rumored to arrive this year with a $1,000 price tag and monocular display. If so, his goal of scaling to 10+ million in sales seems optimistic, but we'll have to see how things play out.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">Strong Ray-Ban sales</a> aside, there are four times the monthly active Ray-Ban Meta users than a year ago, and Meta says "the number of people using voice commands is growing even faster."</p>

<p>Meta's "five major opportunities" for further growth include using their internal AI to build better ad campaigns, recommending more relevant social media and video content via AI, and creating "AI business agents that can do customer support and sales" in apps like WhatsApp and Messenger.</p><p>In other words, most AI profits will come from integrations into current apps or behind-the-scenes work. But Meta also explained why it needed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/new-meta-ai-app-provides-llama-4-powered-challenge-to-gemini">convert Meta AI into a standalone app</a>, which it did this week.</p><p>International WhatsApp users like to message the Meta AI in-app, but Zuckerberg admitted that they are "clearly not the primary messaging app in the United States" thanks to iMessage. So Americans have fewer opportunities to use Meta Ai.</p><p>That's why this standalone app is important to "establishing leadership as the main personal AI that people use," Zuckerberg says, with "faster access" and a "more built-out feature set" appealing to power users who might prefer ChatGPT or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> for now.</p>

<p>Meta's CFO said that the company is "well-positioned to navigate the macro-economic uncertainty" and "legal and regulatory headwinds" facing the company.</p><p>Meta didn't discuss the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/technology/meta-ftc-trial-whatsapp-instagram.html">Congressional antitrust hearings</a>, nor did any investors bring them up.</p><p>Instead, Meta seems to be worried about the EU ruling that its "subscription for no ads model is not compliant with the Digital Markets Act (DMA)," the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">DMA</a> that's pushing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/eu-dma-ruling-could-completely-reshape-fitness-smartwatch-industry">Apple to open up its watch ecosystem</a> and Google to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">lessen its Search monopoly</a>.</p><p>European ads account for 16% of its profits, Li said, and while Meta is "in the process of engaging with the European Commission," they seem to think this could lead to a significant dip in profits.</p><p>In addition, Meta noted "reduced spend in the U.S. from Asia-based e-commerce exporters...in anticipation of the de minimis exemption going away on May 2" for Trump's Chinese tariffs.</p><p>Ultimately, Meta predicted that Q2 2025 profits will range from $42.5–45.5 billion; they're expecting further growth, but that $3-billion range stems entirely from these regulatory issues and potential tariff fallout.</p>

Even if you choose a different plan, T-Mobile is offering up to $600 off the Galaxy S25 with "most" of its data plans, so you&apos;re sure to receive some epic savings either way. </p>

<p>As described in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">our 4/5-star review</a>, the Samsung Galaxy S25 is a perfectly-balanced flagship that doesn&apos;t skimp on premium features. You get the same powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the more-expensive Galaxy S25 Ultra, plus 12GB of RAM, seven years of guaranteed OS/security updates, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features straight out of the box. Clocking in with a 6.2-inch display, it&apos;s also a relatively <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">small phone</a>, which may be refreshing for folks who are sick of smartphones getting bigger and bigger in recent years. </p><p>Of course, nothing is ever perfect. Unlike the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, the base model S25 lacks UWB (ultra-wideband) support, and the 25W wired charging isn&apos;t going to win awards for speed any time soon. But aside from a few (relatively) minor complaints, the Galaxy S25 is an all-around solid flagship, and if you can get it free through your carrier, it&apos;s an absolute steal.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung Electronics announced its Q1 earnings on Wednesday (April 30), and it seems like the company ended this quarter on a high note. The Korean OEM said its consolidated revenue from January to March 31 was 79.14 trillion won ($56 billion), which is up 10% from 2024 (78.1 trillion Korean won). And the company's stock prices fell by 0.5% according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/finance/quote/005930:KRX?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiC_uXSyoCNAxVEtokEHSy4JWQQ3ecFegQIRBAX">Google Finance.</a></p><p>The company also stated that its first-quarter operating revenue was up to 6.7 trillion Korean won, which is around $4.7 billion, 1.5% <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/30/samsungs-first-quarter-earnings-beat-expectations-as-chip-sales-rise.html">higher</a> than last year (6.4 trillion Korean won). Samsung stated that this rise in revenue is all thanks to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series sales and high-value-added home appliances.</p><p>This suggests that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-launch">Samsung Galaxy S25 series</a>, which launched in January, has been quite popular among smartphone enthusiasts as it is bolstered with Samsung's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI </a>and other powerful specs.</p>

<p>However, the operating profit of the company's DS division, which is responsible for manufacturing semiconductors, saw a decline in revenue. The company announced 1.1 trillion Korean won in revenue for its DS division in the first quarter, down from 1.91 trillion won reported during the same time last year.</p><p>“For the Memory Business, revenue was driven by expanded server DRAM sales and the addressing of additional NAND demand amid a perceived bottoming out of the market price,” the company said.</p><p>For those unaware, DRAM and NAND are two fundamental types of semiconductors that are used extensively in CPUs, GPUs, computers, and other modern electronics, which run AI on them.</p><p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-first-quarter-2025-results">said</a> in its earnings statement that despite selling more chips this quarter, it saw a dip in revenue due to the lower average selling price (ASP). Additionally, they didn't sell as many of their AI memory (HBM) chips due to "export controls on AI chips and deferred demand in anticipation of upcoming enhanced HBM3E products."</p>

<p>During the earnings call, Samsung's leadership indicated that, due to the recent global economic tension, including the reciprocal tariffs imposed by the U.S., the company had taken a direct hit.</p><p>This "led to a slowdown in growth and increased fluctuations in financial markets, raising concerns about the performance of tech companies, especially in the semiconductor industry."</p><p>Looking ahead, the company said that despite the uncertain trade situation, it "will continue to launch top-tier innovative products and services to overcome the challenges and maintain our position as a leading tech company."</p><p>The company confirmed that it will be looking at other areas of innovation and also branch out into new areas like robotics and AI, which will help them keep up with the volatile financial environment.</p><p>Speaking of the year ahead, Samsung stated that its overall performance is expected to improve in the second half of the year. Every year, Samsung launches its foldables around July, and we're expecting to see the same happening this year as well, which could nudge the company's performance in a better direction.

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-32">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The ITC has ruled in Oura's favor, saying Ultrahuman and RingConn straight-up copied its smart ring tech.</li><li>Oura’s unique design, fancy curved battery, and slick sensors were at the heart of the fight.</li><li>If this ruling sticks, both rivals could be kicked out of the U.S. market unless they revamp their rings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a landmark ruling that could shake up the wearable tech market, Oura has scored a big victory against rivals Ultrahuman and RingConn in a high-stakes patent fight.</p><p>The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) sided with Oura, finding that both companies infringed on key patents for Oura’s smart ring—meaning its competing rings could soon be banned from the U.S. market.</p><p>Oura has long dominated the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart ring space</a>. But in recent years, competitors like Ultrahuman and RingConn have rolled out suspiciously similar-looking rings, prompting Oura to take legal action.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY" name="Ultrahuman-Ring-Air-held-in-fingertips.jpeg" alt="The Ultrahuman Ring Air held in fingertips to show the Ultrahuman logo engraved inside." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s2JMLAg9gfcFFFs72AYoqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Ultrahuman Ring Air </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At the heart of the case is Oura’s dual-housing design, curved battery tech, and advanced sensors.</p><p>Oura argued that Ultrahuman’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ring Air</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ringconn-gen-2-smart-ring-review">RingConn’s Smart Ring</a> ripped off these features, and after a deep dive into engineering schematics, CT scans, and even tear-down videos, the ITC agreed.</p>
<h2 id="ultrahuman-s-sketchy-moves-backfire-2">Ultrahuman’s sketchy moves backfire</h2>
<p>Things got messy during the trial when Ultrahuman got caught faking evidence about a supposed U.S. manufacturing plant in Texas. Turns out, the company photoshopped Ultrahuman logos onto a third-party facility and altered internal documents to make it seem like the company made rings stateside.</p><p>The judge called Ultrahuman’s CEO “not credible” and slammed the company for “lack of truthfulness.” Oura even hired a private investigator to expose the deception.</p><p>The ITC’s initial ruling recommends blocking Ultrahuman and RingConn from importing infringing rings into the U.S., and halting sales of existing stock.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-possible-u-s-import-ban-2">What’s next? Possible U.S. import ban</h2>
<p>If finalized, this could force both companies to either redesign their rings or exit the U.S. market entirely. That’s a big deal, considering America is one of the largest markets for wearables.</p><p>Oura didn’t mince words in its victory lap. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/oura-itc-case/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, the company said the ruling validates the strength of Oura’s intellectual property and makes it clear it'll protect what it built, down to every last algorithm and sensor-packed band of titanium.</p><p>Meanwhile, RingConn’s CEO admitted under oath that the company studied Oura’s rings, which probably didn’t help its case.</p>

<ul><li>Gmail is adding the ability to react to emails with emojis.</li><li>The reactions are primarily for Gmail users, with users of other email providers getting a limited experience.</li><li>Reactions are turned off by default and can be restricted by Google Workspace administrators in school or work settings.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out the ability to react to emails with emojis in Gmail, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/04/emoji-reactions-in-gmail.html" target="_blank">Workspace Blog post</a>. The feature addition will make sending and replying to an email more like interacting with a chat on a typical messaging platform, like Google Chat or Slack. These emoji reactions will be visible to everyone on the email chain, and could reduce the need for replying to mass emails to confirm receipt.</p><p>The company says that email reactions in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gmail">Gmail</a> can help users "quickly respond, acknowledge receipt of an email, and express themselves more authentically."</p><p>With that being said, email reactions in Gmail may not become as prevalent as you might expect. They are turned off by default, and can be restricted by your school or work in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Workspace</a> domain. For administrators, emoji reactions can be managed by navigating to <strong>Admin console </strong>><strong> Apps </strong>><strong> Gmail </strong>><strong> End User Access </strong>><strong> Emoji reactions</strong>.</p><p>Additionally, reactions won't work properly for those not using Gmail, those who have their conversation view turned off, or those who have an outdated version of the Gmail app. In all these cases, Gmail reactions will come through as a standalone email using the following format: “[Name] reacted via Gmail."</p>

<hr>
<p>Another report highlights Google's upcoming support for controlling the temperature inside your car.</p><p>In conjunction with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-auto-climate-controls-demo-3549019/">Android Authority</a>, tipster AssembleDebug has reportedly uncovered how Android Auto's climate control UI will look for drivers. The main highlight of this leak from the software's code is how the controls sit in the static bottom bar. Moreover, there are two sets of controls. The left side hosts two options for A/C and heating for your seats.</p><p>Tapping each puts them in those modes while the next element, for higher/lower temps, is for a car's normal air from its vents. Besides that is a fan icon that <em>might </em>let drivers control the strength at which air flows from their vents. After, there are "Front" and "Rear" icons.</p><p>This one's curious because it either indicates the ability to apply your air controls to the two halves of your vehicle, or it applies to the defogger.</p><p>However, the two instances of air controls seem to apply to the driver's side and the passenger side separately. If one side of your guests is too chilly, you can lessen that without impacting your own cooling (in theory). The tipster states there was a "Sync" ability present, so drivers wouldn't have to tinker with both sets of controls.</p>
<h2 id="android-auto-gets-more-attention-2">Android Auto gets more Attention</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:991px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.51%;"><img id="uLe34Pa4sMmTa5DtCBbXDg" name="android-auto-climate-control-ui-leaked-look" alt="A leaked look at two sets of climate controls in Android Auto, including seat cooling/heating, fan strength, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uLe34Pa4sMmTa5DtCBbXDg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="991" height="451" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tipster alleges that while these controls are present in v14.3.151804, there will likely be more details that create limitations. For instance, these controls may only support cars with compatible hardware.</p><p>Early glimpses of Google's work <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-tipped-vehicle-temperature-control--code-spotted">to bring temperature controls</a> to Android Auto were discovered in March. There were only a few barebones instances of code that teased "high" and "low" air capabilities for the software. Now, with more concrete buttons and functions seemingly available, perhaps Google's progress is coming along smoothly. Though there's no telling when this could roll out and which car manufacturers could see full support for it.</p><p>Another expected feature update concerns Gemini's capabilities for drivers. The code for this possibility was initially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-live-android-auto-integration-potential">discovered late last year</a>, but a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-gemini-demo-showcase-reported">more recent version</a> showed what all it might entail. It seems Google is preparing to bring voice-operated Gemini functions for drivers looking to start their music. What's more, the AI also displayed the ability to offer information on landmarks and plan a day of traveling before hitting the road.</p><p>Android Auto's code glimpsed how Gemini would be able to plan a "cheap" trip under a certain limit for drivers while also breaking down suggested accommodations, food, and sightseeing opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="what-else-do-we-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-s-battery-and-charging-specs-2">What else do we know about the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7's battery and charging specs?</h2>
<p>Although Samsung hasn't officially announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> or its charging information, credible data found in Chinese regulatory filings suggest that charging speeds will remain unchanged compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.myfixguide.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold7-and-z-flip7-gets-3c-certification-with-25w-charger/" target="_blank">MySmartFix</a>). Specifically, the device's China Compulsory Certificate states that the phone will support 9V, 2.77A charging, equaling the 25W wired charging spec we're used to.</p><p>Additionally, current rumors and leaks suggest that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 will feature the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-support-wireless-charging">15W wireless charging speed</a> and 4.5W reverse wireless charging speed as its predecessor. As 15W is required for the Qi2 wireless charging standard, it's possible that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging" target="_blank">has Qi2.1 support</a>, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25" target="_blank">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which accommodates magnetic cases.</p>

<p>The filings also note that the Galaxy Z Flip 7, model number SM-F7660, will get a slight battery capacity bump this year. The foldable will feature a 4,174mAh capacity split across two battery cells, which is an increase over the 4,000mAh capacity in the Galaxy Z Flip 6.</p><p>Note that none of this is official until Samsung launches the phone later this year. However, the lack of charging upgrades could be disappointing to Galaxy Z Flip fans, if true. Samsung has brought 45W charging to various price points over the years, most recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a36-vs-google-pixel-9a">the budget Samsung Galaxy A36</a>. However, the company's premium flagships have been left out.</p><p>Samsung is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">tipped</a> to launch the Galaxy Z Flip 7 at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-summer-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">a Galaxy Unpacked event in New York City</a> sometime in mid-July. For now, the best Samsung clamshell foldable you can buy is the Galaxy Z Flip 6, which is expected to have the same charging specs as the upcoming Galaxy Z Flip 7.</p>

<ul><li>A massive leak shows glimpses of what Android 16's redesign could look like, which involves a more blurred/transparent notification panel.</li><li>Google's code shows it has plans to revamp its lock screen with a new font and a new position for its date/temp and a few "geometric" app icon choices.</li><li>Android 16 is expected to debut in Q2 2025 and I/O 2025 could very well hold a more detailed look at what's to come.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is fast-tracking its next major OS update, and a recent leak claims to have unearthed its potential redesign.</p><p>This suspected look at Android 16's redesign comes from Mishaal Rahman for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-new-design-changes-leak-3549582/">Android Authority</a>. These UI changes were reportedly found while sifting through Android 16 Beta 4. To begin, Rahman found Google's work to revamp the selection of available icon shapes in the Pixel Launcher. The post states the OS could bring more "geometric" shape options, as well as the standard circle.</p><p>Rahman found choices like a square, a "four-sided cookie," and a "seven-sided cookie." It also seems that, if a new design is chosen, users would find it on their home screens and the app drawer.</p><p>Elsewhere, the notification panel seems in line for an overhaul. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> Beta 4's code showed that the panel may adopt a blurred/transparent approach. Currently, Android offers a basic black background when the panel is pulled down completely. Even when pulled down partly to view notifications, Android 16 is showing a blurred design that isn't so bleak.</p><p>Moreover, several UI components have changed, such as the panel's tiles. The tiles appear a little more bubbly, with even rounder corners. The icons within them are more square, which Rahman states could indicate Google's "one-tap" function for enabling/disabling Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Another key change appears to involve Android 16's volume sliders. In the quick settings panel, the bar is no longer pill-shaped with rounded corners. Instead, Rahman observed a long rectangular bar with soft corners. Additionally, the end of the bar (that marks its position) features a vertical bar. This change was spotted in the full volume panel, too.</p><p>Other major changes concern the lock screen for Android 16. Rahman's snapshots show Google may alter the font of the clock while moving the date and temperature beneath it. If there are notifications, the clock will still move to the top left; however, the date/temp information will be featured on its right side, not under it.</p><p>Some other smaller UI changes feel more like refreshers as Android 16 could implement colored icons in Settings. The status bar may also update its icons for Wi-Fi and 5G, as well as a swap in font for the clock. What's more, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">battery icon may see a pop of color</a> as Google could drop the old vertical colorless icon for a horizontal battery with its percentage and a color-coded background.</p><p>Rahman's disclaimer states these changes were forced into the open as Google didn't have them readily available in Beta 4. So, while they exist, it's not clear <em>when </em>users could see them all.</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead-2">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>The company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-drops-android-16-beta-4-before-the-big-stable-launch-in-may">Android 16 Beta 4</a> update arrived for Pixel users last week amid the software's "Platform Stability" milestone.

Other OEMs have also started their betas for Android 16 as the software crosses a crucial development point.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google's I/O 2025</a> event is coming up, slated to run from May 20-21. Android 16 is expected to be a major part of it, considering we've already crossed into Q2.

<hr>
<p>Google continues to build interest around its upcoming I/O event in May, and its latest attempts are all about Gemini.</p><p>In a recent newsletter from the company highlighted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/29/gemini-i-o-2025-tease/">9to5Google</a>, many of its Gemini AI model updates were reiterated for user awareness. However, the most important information came at the end when Google teased more of its AI during I/O 2025.</p><p>The newsletter states the event will showcase updates for a "more personalized assistant" in Gemini alongside "enhanced productivity" and new ways to "interact and leverage" it.</p><p>Seeing as this is just a teaser, Google never goes into specific details about <em>what </em>these updates could look like/bring. The publication speculates a few of these updates could involve the company's Project Astra or even its 2.5 Flash/Pro models. What users can take away from this is Google once again highlighted its May 20-21 date for I/O 2025. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">main keynote</a> will take place on May 20 at 10 am PT.</p>

<p>If we're chasing the 2.5 Flash theory, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-gemini-2-5-flash-with-hybrid-reasoning-and-boasts-faster-speeds">released the model in mid-April</a>, boasting hybrid reasoning and quicker speeds. Its arrival is limited, as Google stated developers could get their hands on it to begin building with 2.5 Flash. Developers can also enable or disable the model's "thinking," which will let 2.5 Flash retain its speed while improving its accuracy.</p><p>With "thinking" on, 2.5 Flash will take a moment to respond as it's "capable of reasoning." Google explains its model will use that brief moment to "better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response.” These complex tasks can include math equations or the analysis of research questions.</p><p>If Google is indeed looking to "enhance" user productivity through 2.5 Flash, perhaps they'll be more in store later next month.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">I/O 2025</a> is shaping up to have a lot in store during its initial keynote. Aside from a haul of AI announcements, the company recently revealed its sessions list, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">Material 3 "Expressive"</a> is a key aspect. Google teased that this new UX design will be "emotional" and "next-level" for users. Additionally, the company confirmed it will go into detail about its Android XR space. We've already seen a bit of this — known as "memory" — during its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 tech demo</a>.</p>

<ul><li>OnePlus confirms that its compact 13T will not be available in Europe or North America, limiting its release to China and India(as the 13s).</li><li>While the exact reasons for this limited release remain unclear, OnePlus says it will think about bringing such devices globally in the future.</li><li>Despite its compact size, the OnePlus 13T boasts high-end specifications, including the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, a 6260mAh battery with 80W fast charging, and a dual 50MP camera system.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus 13T has been the talk of the town lately, with its recent release in China. However, looks like the company is restricting its availability to its home ground and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-the-compact-powerful-phone-is-coming-to-india-as-oneplus-13s">India</a>.</p><p>A OnePlus spokesperson confirmed to<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658021/oneplus-13t-13s-europe-us-availability"> The Verge</a> this week that the smaller<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shows-off-the-oneplus-13t"> OnePlus 13T</a> will not be sold in Europe and only its high-end flagships, the OnePlus 13 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/grab-the-flagship-level-oneplus-13r-for-just-usd399-99-at-best-buy-today">OnePlus 13R, </a>will continue to be available in these regions.</p><p>While we aren't sure why the company chose to make this move, Celina Shi, OnePlus Europe’s chief marketing officer, told the publication that it currently has no plans to launch the OnePlus 13T in Europe.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8" name="oneplus-13t-color-options" alt="The OnePlus 13T in a variety of colors: Morning Grey, Heart-pounding Pink, Cloudy Ink Black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We did feel a bit hopeful about a North American launch when the company announced that it would be bringing the 13T, re-branded as the 13s, to the Indian market. However, The Verge added that OnePlus's North America head of marketing, Spenser Blank, also confirmed that this compact phone won't be making it to the U.S. or Canada.</p><p>While this isn't surprising at all, considering OnePlus was only dropping teasers exclusively for its users in China, and didn't mention an international or global rollout for the device.  As 9to5Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/29/oneplus-13t-united-states-europe/" target="_blank">notes</a>, this could also have something to do with the volatile tariffs situation between China and the U.S., despite President Trump's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs" target="_blank">exemption (for now) of electronics</a> from his tariffs.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A synergy of power and proportion. Coming soon. #OnePlus13sKnow more: https://t.co/vGl4VNimgR pic.twitter.com/eKScQQoCtr<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1916742893345140980">April 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Furthermore, the device does come with exceptional specs, specifically a massive battery. The phone has a smaller 6.32-inch display, weighing around 185 grams. Though small, it is as powerful as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android flagships</a> on the market.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T will have the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> at its core, just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. Despite its compact size, the phone will sport a massive 6,260 mAh battery, supported by 80W fast charging. The device will sport two powerful cameras: a 50MP main camera and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom.</p><p>That said, it's not all bad news for those who were waiting to get their hands on this phone, since Shi reiterated that considering several users showed interest in the OnePlus 13T, they "will keep it in mind as we make product launch decisions going forward.”</p><p>The OnePlus 13T launched in China on April 24, and the company teased that it will be "coming soon" to India.</p>

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQKDML"><strong>the retailer is carving 30% off the 40mm Galaxy Watch 7 (BT), knocking the price of the beloved wearable down to just $209.99</strong>.</a> </p><p>For a little perspective, this deal knocks the price of the Cream version of the watch down to its lowest point ever, while the Green variant hasn&apos;t seen a discount this good since the Black Friday sales last fall. I don&apos;t know <em>why</em> Amazon has decided to unleash such a compelling price drop right now, but I&apos;m certainly not complaining. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a> is a near-perfect smartwatch, boasting clean design, snappy performance and all of the latest Wear OS 5 and Galaxy AI software features. Pick up the 40mm watch from Amazon today and you'll score a straight 30% discount. The 44mm version of the watch is also scoring discounts of up to 27%, so take your pick.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2c55fcb4-ee52-4cc9-8fbd-bc8d123a08b2" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$299.99" data-dimension48="$299.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a sleek, durable smartwatch with a vibrant display and all of the latest Wear OS technology; you&apos;re already immersed in the Samsung device ecosystem. </p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you need the best possible battery life in a wearable; you&apos;d rather wait to see what discounts drop this summer when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a> is (presumably) revealed. </p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 tops our list of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a> that money can buy today, coming complete with a lightning-fast Exynos W1000 processor, a durable AMOLED display, and a comprehensive suite of health and fitness tracking technology. You also get four years of guaranteed Wear OS updates and two premium features that I always look for in a smartwatch: dual-band GPS and NFC support. </p><p>Sure, the battery life may not match the longevity of, say, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, but you&apos;re still getting about 48 hours of charge on average, which is pretty standard for a flagship watch these days. Otherwise, the Galaxy Watch 7 is a near-perfect smartwatch for most folks, and with a historic discount like this in tow, there&apos;s no reason to put off your purchase any longer. </p>

<p>The Pixel 9a is notable as it comes with a brand-new design aesthetic; Google's mid-range phones had the same design as its mainline devices, but this time around, the brand went with a different aesthetic to distinguish the device. Google says that it wanted to give the Pixel A series its own distinct character, and that's evident in the design. <br><br>As a result, the camera bar gave way to a pill-sized housing that doesn't attract anywhere as much attention. What I like the most about the new design is that the camera module sits flush with the chassis; this makes a big difference in usability, and after testing dozens of phones with massive camera islands that jut out considerably, it's a refreshing change of pace to use the Pixel 9a.</p>

<p>The phone looks cleaner thanks to the minimalist design at the back, and while it has flat sides, the edges are beveled, so there are no issues with usability. The Pixel 9a is a smidgen taller and thicker than the Pixel 9 Pro, but it is still great to use one-handed, and Google did a great job with the in-hand feel.</p>

<p>Just like the Pixel 9 and 9 Pro, the Pixel 9a gets IP68 dust and water resistance as standard, making it immune to immersion in water. Google continues its usage of optical fingerprint modules, and it does a good job; it was fast to authenticate, and the location is ideal.</p>

<p>If anything, I prefer using the phone to mainline Pixel 9 devices, and Google got the basics absolutely right: the weight distribution is ideal, the rounded corners make it comfortable to hold, and the back has a matte texture that doesn't attract smudges. The mid-frame is made out of recycled aluminum, and overall, I really like what Google did with the design — even though I didn't get the Iris variant.</p>

<p>There's a lot to like with the panel as well; the 6.3-inch OLED has 120Hz refresh, and it gets noticeably brighter than its predecessors. Google is doing a great job in this regard in general, with the Pixel 9 Pro XL delivering the brightest panel of any phone I tested. Colors are great too, and I didn't see any inconsistencies in the two weeks I used the Pixel 9a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jg4AvwDNzbB79PpfkmD4DE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a next to Pixel 9 and 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jg4AvwDNzbB79PpfkmD4DE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a gets the same Tensor G4 platform as the rest of the Pixel 9 series, and it retains seven shader cores. Overheating has been a big problem with the Pixel 8a last year, and the Pixel 9a does a better job in this regard thanks to a new cooling system. It isn't quite as effective as what you get on the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, but the phone doesn't throttle anywhere as early, or heat up as much — or as quickly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HDBcYRxRexbugq9Sr2DCRE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a back on a red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HDBcYRxRexbugq9Sr2DCRE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, cameras continue to be the defining feature on all Pixels, and the Pixel 9a has two great sensors at the back. Google continues to rely on software tuning to deliver the best images and videos, but the sensor hardware itself isn't the best you get in this category; it will be interesting to see if Google manages to switch to bigger camera modules to take full advantage of its tuning algorithms.</p>
<p>That said, the Pixel 9a is one of the best mid-range cameras available today; the Vivo V50 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-v40-pro-review">V40 Pro</a> take better portraits and have increased versatility, but the Pixel 9a is still the most consistent shooter. While there's no tele lens on the device, it uses in-sensor zoom to deliver decent shots at 2x.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="e3XabXt4HrLqtSub6abN8E" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a side view highlighting power and volume buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3XabXt4HrLqtSub6abN8E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Where the Pixel 9a truly stands out is battery life; it delivers the best battery longevity of any Pixel I used in the last nine years. The 5100mAh battery is bigger than what you get on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the device easily managed to last a day and a half even with heavy use. I would have liked to see better charging tech, but Google continues to limit it to 23W — at least it uses the standard USB PD 3.0 protocol, so you can use any charger.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, the Pixel 9a has the best software of any mid-range phone. While it doesn't have all the AI-based utilities you get on the Pixel 9 Pro, Google brought its most-used utilities over to the device, and it gives the phone a distinct advantage. The UI itself is enjoyable; there's no bloatware, there's good fluidity, and I like the Material You aesthetic.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a in-hand view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jCm4AVyYi3pzUVTSHc6gDE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Pixel 9a will get seven years of Android OS updates — more than any other phone in this category. While Samsung comes close with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">Galaxy A56</a>, that device has severe shortcomings in other areas, and I just wouldn't recommend buying it over the Pixel 9a.</p>
<p>With the Pixel 9a, Google basically took all the best features from mainline Pixels and condensed it into an affordable package. The Pixel 9a feels great to hold and use, the OLED panel is brighter than previous years, you get better thermal management, great cameras, and the best software in this category. Combine all of that with class-leading battery life, and the Pixel 9a is an undeniable hit.</p>

It’s not an E Ink display the likes of which you see on eReaders, nor is it the same as standard OLED or LCD panels we’ve come to know on mobile devices. While the underlying screen is an LCD, TCL’s take on it is one of the more unique attempts to change up what a display can be.</p><p>Its matte finish is specifically designed to mimic paper, and while initially designed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/testing-three-eye-friendly-display-technologies" target="_blank">help reduce eye strain</a> from exposure to blue light, its distinctive look makes for an interesting alternative. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcl-60-xe-nxtpaper-5g-launch" target="_blank">NXTPAPER 11 Plus</a> tablet standing out as TCL’s signature device under its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcls-60-series-phones-pack-premium-features-without-the-high-end-price">NXTPAPER lineup in 2025</a>, the concept behind this tech is showing signs of maturity.</p>

<h2 id="bringing-paper-to-screen-2">Bringing paper to screen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uqY4CNqasw39HEKCNZYo7i" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-tablet-food-photo" alt="Photo showing food on TCL Tab 10 NXTPAPER tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uqY4CNqasw39HEKCNZYo7i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Considering the creeping stagnation seen in what Samsung, Google, and Apple continue to bring to market, NXTPAPER feels like a fresh approach, even if it’s not entirely disparate from existing screen technologies. It’s still an LCD panel, only with a blue light filter and nano-matrix lithography to produce the paper-like effect. It makes the matte screen look more textured, partly due to perceived contrast, but also because of the diffused backlight emanating from the display.</p><p>That explains why the overall screen brightness isn’t as high compared to other common screen types. Still, it's rare to see an LCD screen emulate E Ink — both in monochrome and color — making TCL’s NXTPAPER devices the most comfortable ones (aside from eReaders) to read ebooks. There are three modes: Ink Paper desaturates the entire display of color, Color Paper adds limited color, and Regular mode runs the whole color gamut.</p>

<p>However, two major challenges pop up. First is the lower brightness, which makes the screen harder to see in brighter settings. Although the matte finish reduces glare, higher peak brightness is required to see everything on screen in brighter sunlight, posing a problem for these devices outdoors.</p><p>The other is a sort of two-pronged limitation, which is that everything onscreen won’t be as sharp as high-resolution LCD or OLED panels, in spite of TCL trying to ramp up contrast. Nor can it completely block blue light, so your eyes will still be susceptible to strain; it just takes longer for the effects to be noticeable.</p>

<p>Simply put, NXTPAPER can’t match the vibrancy of an OLED panel with good HDR (high dynamic range), a discrepancy that’s also more apparent based on the content you’re looking at. A show or movie on Netflix won’t look as crisp on a NXTPAPER display, though a comic book or graphic novel is far easier on the eyes via TCL’s technology.</p><p>While not a 100% substitute for E Ink displays, ebooks do look great on these displays as well. Visual art looks more impactful, mainly because a comic book, graphic novel, lithograph — basically, any medium with a history in paper —  appears more authentic because of it.</p>

<p>Could that expand to content we take for granted on mobile devices? Is there an advantage in viewing photos, art, and other images on a NXTPAPER display?</p><p>TCL thinks so, especially now that it claims NXTPAPER 4.0 reproduces colors accurately enough to compete with LCD and OLED panels. The keyword there is “compete,” but it applies somewhat loosely under the circumstances. While more vibrant than before, especially with gradations, NXTPAPER won’t match the contrast ratio and vibrancy of LCD or OLED panels.</p><p>Despite that, TCL says it has finally achieved 100% sRGB color accuracy in NXTPAPER 4.0 (up from 70-80% in 3.0), putting it right in line with the 95-100% coverage commonly seen in LCD and OLED screens. Not so much with DCI-P3, a color gamut set for film and TV show production, where support is standard for phones, tablets, TVs, and monitors, but not necessarily for NXTPAPER devices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K6yMKCLLBRjcNqCzK9NFQh" name="TCL-NXTPAPER-11-Plus-Enhanced-eye-comfort" alt="Screen showing different eye comfort modes on TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K6yMKCLLBRjcNqCzK9NFQh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Brightness also remains a big hurdle, where an increase to a peak of 450 nits in NXTPAPER 4.0 still falls well behind the 500-1,000 or more nits you can expect from those other panels. TCL positions its matte finish and blue light filtering as an equalizer, as it’s intended to make it easier to see in both bright and dark conditions without straining.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Personalized Eye Comfort Mode adjusts color, brightness, and contrast to fit with your own preferences. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>That can depend on said conditions, which is why TCL is trying its hand at injecting AI into the mix. Newer features like Smart Eye Comfort Mode will adjust screen settings no matter what’s onscreen, addressing both content consumption and creation. In tandem with that, Personalized Eye Comfort Mode adjusts color, brightness, and contrast to fit with your own preferences.</p><p>The idea is that your viewing experience may differ from someone else using the same device, but that’s hard to tell without properly testing the newest version.</p>

<p>When I saw the new NXTPAPER devices at CES in Las Vegas and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">Mobile World Congress</a> in Barcelona, TCL reps presented other changes engineers made to the underlying tech.</p><p>Where previous generations have chemical etching, the latest version uses a more advanced nano-matrix lithography etching process to produce a crisper and clearer image for text, images, and video. It’s hard to gauge that under brief demos, but some before-and-after examples of text and photos suggest there’s merit to the claim.</p><p>This might explain why TCL markets the NXTPAPER 11 Plus as a productivity device as well. Unlike previous versions, where the focus lay more on consumption as an e-reader alternative, improving color and brightness is supposed to lend more credibility to this latest iteration, being more than that.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>TCL sees the potential for art, painting, drawing, sketching, and photo editing this time around.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It’s just not entirely clear what that means yet. The limited color gamut in previous models didn’t always translate to the best accuracy across all visual mediums. TCL sees the potential for art, painting, drawing, sketching, and photo editing this time around, all indicated by the fact that the 11 Plus comes with a stylus. Moreover, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tcls-60-series-phones-pack-premium-features-without-the-high-end-price" target="_blank">TCL 60 XE NXTPAPER</a> phone will also showcase the latest version, so we’ll see how it all looks on a smaller display as well.</p><p>The thing is, neither of these new devices is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">flagship tablet</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">smartphone</a> competitor. TCL’s screen technology is still decidedly mid-range, likely as a means to keep costs down and prove NXTPAPER’s viability in an otherwise tight market dominated by incumbents.</p><p>Time will tell how it turns out, but for now, this unique screen technology is showing signs of meaningful progress. Yet, if it doesn’t gain more traction, could TCL license the technology to others, especially since it owns patents specific to eye protection? Perhaps, but that seems unlikely in the short term.</p><p>Much like TCL plays a patient game within the TV and home theater category, it may very well be playing the long game in the mobile space, too.</p>

Valerion is a sub-brand of AWOL Vision, and it is clearly setting its sights on the high-end market with its VisionMaster series. I used the VisionMaster Pro 2 for a while now, and the projector gets a lot right: it is one of the brightest Google TV projectors I used — going up to 3,000 lumens — and it has a three-laser light source, Dolby Vision, great built-in sound, and low lag of just 4ms at 1080p, making it a great choice to pair with a console. <br><br>The VisionMaster Pro 2 costs $2,999 on Amazon as of writing, and that's significantly more than most of its rivals; I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/xgimi-horizon-s-max-review">tested XGIMI's Horizon S Max</a> when it debuted, and that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/XGIMI-Projector-Enhanced-Portable-Intelligent/dp/B0DDQ66B6L/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ZETJ0VR2NYXO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2ClbdjBY95IEu98LGE2S8Vx0dle8KwXW7k7GmCtro2jbMpXY0l21xXFFCGoDkNmbJLbaygBoKPvqzPrW1QN0Ig.Q0x6jEzDliv1bvtLxbQmRPP0OqYdzFULYrnMnLUboko&dib_tag=se&keywords=horizon+s+max&qid=1745978082&s=electronics&sprefix=horizon+s+%2Celectronics%2C415&sr=1-1">model is available at $1,609</a> now, and Dangbei's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/dangbei-mars-pro-2-dbox02-review">excellent Mars Pro 2</a> is once again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dangbei-DBOX02-Projector-Officially-Bluetooth/dp/B0D17LQ4PR/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3UFTY8ENJTOKZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.fQvAI-rD5WdVk58a8FrmKm1njJq_RNdN3ElQKEOdgRJV_UA5_O3XF49g2McqzIW2cdzP9Q6o5rHhVQGHHbYBRdMwFXcJfR-RKsN3RMdPEKJcqleyR84oJRCaP7y75ftF_Ah6V21BUwraJfN3jOFdmQVDgTweT8IenYV6Ffh14rEUcT3cVayMfQ-t1Sw7tTElvqy0RPC3uBsKy9s3GMyIuZoIsnxwQomKWNjH-4m5Is0.c3k5NFgt8Chl1hSUXA7-2aUUQBxb84TpNgz6rWhCoE8&dib_tag=se&keywords=dangbei+mars+pro+2&qid=1745978105&sprefix=dangbei+mars+%2Caps%2C279&sr=8-1">down to $1,399</a>.

<p>The differentiator with the VisionMaster Pro 2 is that it gets brighter than any other projector I used. Then there's the design; Valerion wanted to make a statement with this projector, and it has a bold design that stands out. The green hue looks distinctive in its own right, but the addition of chrome inserts on all sides gives it significant presence.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kp2abK3Riz8gPMwK33MpH6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kp2abK3Riz8gPMwK33MpH6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no question that this is the best-looking projector yet, and while design is never a consideration when selecting a projector, I like the attention to detail Valerion lavished on this thing. There are other niceties; you get a built-in stand at the bottom that lets you incline the projector, and it makes a difference. While it doesn't have a gimbal system like the Horizon S Max or JMGO's projectors, setting it up was straightforward.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="donYUqdsySafDFhf6evYJ6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/donYUqdsySafDFhf6evYJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The back of the unit houses all the ports, and they're hidden behind a cover. You get two HDMI 2.1ports and an eARC, optical out, dual USB-A connectors, and Ethernet. The front of the projector has a clean design, with the lens on the right and the TOF sensor located on the left — this is used to configure keystone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HsXKH4n7WKXmLmFPaBEkH6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HsXKH4n7WKXmLmFPaBEkH6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the VisionMaster Pro 2 does a great job with keystone correction, and it's able to adjust the image orientation in just a few seconds. Autofocus is effortless as well, and you get the usual object avoidance features. You can mount the projector on a stand, or affix it to the ceiling.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WSnSHokDVVLMc9F8nLTrD6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WSnSHokDVVLMc9F8nLTrD6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The VisionMaster Pro 2 has a throw ratio of 0.9 to 1.5:1, and it goes up to a 300-inch image. In regular use, you'll realistically set it up at a 100-inch projection as that involves mounting the unit 12 feet away, and this is what I did. It gets Dolby Vision, HDR10+, IMAX Enhanced, motion smoothing, and a decent set of image modes and good customizability when it comes to adjusting settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vP5bw4y6Lgp265AHKePER6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vP5bw4y6Lgp265AHKePER6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the gaming mode brings down the latency to just 4ms when used at a 1080p resolution and 240Hz. It gives the VisionMaster Pro 2 added versatility, and if you need 4K gaming, latency is at 15ms. You get the usual Google TV interface, and there are no restrictions with streaming services — Netflix is installed out of the box, and you can download any other service via the Play Store.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KiTjgX6xAzke2HiZgThkd6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KiTjgX6xAzke2HiZgThkd6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The projector is powered by MediaTek's MT9618, and it gets 4GB of memory alongside 128GB of storage. Given that it has double the memory of most projectors, it is incredibly fluid in regular use, and I didn't see any problems whatsoever in this area. I usually have to connect the Shield TV Pro because most built-in interfaces inevitably become laggy, but that hasn't been an issue on the projector, and it handled HDR content effortlessly.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vuSApKsfsxt8Nx7NVqfBS6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vuSApKsfsxt8Nx7NVqfBS6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's decent built-in sound as well thanks to dual 12W drivers, but I'd suggest pairing the projector with a good audio system to make the most out of the image quality. The bundled remote is good too; it has a distinctive retro styling, and while it is taller, you get all the buttons you need (including mute), and the keys are backlit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MpXp9SU2sNHnno4gWLVCR6" name="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2" alt="Valerion VisionMaster Pro 2 Google TV projector" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpXp9SU2sNHnno4gWLVCR6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Image quality is where the VisionMaster Pro 2 truly comes into its own; thanks to the laser light source, the projector delivers a bright image with outstanding colors. I didn't have any issues even with plenty of ambient light, and picture quality is better than the Horizon S Max, Mars Pro 2, and just about every other projector I used.</p>

<p>The Filmmaker mode has accurate colors, and it's what I'd suggest using. You can easily adjust colors and tailor image quality to your tastes as well, and the picture quality as a whole is faultless. That's always an unknown with a new entrant, but Valerion has shown that it is not only able to hold its own against established rivals, but outmatch most brands. <br><br>Ultimately, that's the key selling point of the VisionMaster Pro 2. It has better colors and brightness than other projectors in this category, combined with the fastest UI of any projector I used, and all the other extras you need.</p>

Whether you want a budget experience, opt for a premium option at a higher price, or fall somewhere in the middle, Motorola believes you'll appreciate what it has to offer. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-2025-razr-makes-me-like-last-years-model-even-more">might be right</a>.</p><p>One of the big things that should have been more show-stealing is the integration of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/moto-ai-launches-new-experiences-and-partnerships-with-ai-leaders-giving-users-choice/">Perplexity AI</a>, among other AI agents. Thanks to Perplexity's deep pockets, it's more than a huge money-printing machine for Motorola; it's also a different way to use AI. And it's what many have been imagining since the beginning.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-26" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025 cover screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TWRFBH69hmoT5yMMNVDz25.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I want to warn everyone right up front: Like every other tech company, Perplexity and Motorola do not have your best interests in mind here. The end goal of all these features is to monetize you and lock you in. In this regard, Perplexity, Motorola, Google, and the rest are all the same.</p><p>When it comes to AI in particular, Perplexity seems to be one of the least reputable, and scandals surround much of what the company does, including its data-sharing practices and the reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://i-hls.com/archives/129019" target="_blank">horrific security of its Android app</a>. Again, you should <em>expect</em> this from tech as purposefully intrusive as AI, regardless of who is building it.</p>

<p>And this is where problems may arise. Perplexity on the Razr isn't what you're used to from other AI apps on other phones. With deep hooks into the system software, you can ask Perplexity to send messages or call an Uber, as well as ask it who the 13th president of the United States was.</p><p>You should think of Perplexity as part of the operating system if you're not exactly sure how data is shared and accessed on your phone. Perplexity needs to know a lot of your details so it can do things for you, and knowing everything isn't always good. I assume the developers have the very best intentions, and the company does tell you about its slightly different privacy practices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="STiUuZUb3pRGJkbPFexEe4" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-25" alt="Perplexity on the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/STiUuZUb3pRGJkbPFexEe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We both know people aren't going to pay a bit of attention to any of it, though, because this is what many people have been waiting for. It's why products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-bought-into-the-ai-hype-and-all-i-got-was-an-orange-square">Rabbit R1</a> almost succeeded. They can turn your phone from a tiny glass box into a useful attendant who is ready and waiting for you to tell it what you need.</p><p>Eventually, the agent can even attempt to think for itself by utilizing what is commonly called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic AI</a>. We see the beginnings of this from Samsung, and when paired up with a "real" AI assistant, things can get a little wild.</p><p>There will be new, possibly severe, security and privacy concerns arising from this. I'm not making a prediction here; I'm telling you that using software that some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-blocking-perplexity-ai-employee-access-2024-4" target="_blank">businesses have reportedly banned</a> due to its security (or lack thereof) and privacy concerns, while allowing it to act with little supervision because of its level of permission, could be problematic.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Motorola to clarify how it's handling user data with its various AI partnerships, including Perplexity, and will update this article when we hear back.</p>
<p>Still, a little hesitation can keep you from getting caught in the middle. Even Perplexity recommends you use incognito mode for anything sensitive, but that's going to be difficult when it's a system-level feature of your phone, you have little real control over.</p><p>Use the feature and even enjoy it. <strong>Never</strong> trust it.</p>

<h2 id="motorola-s-software-update-policy-is-still-no-match-for-the-competition-2">Motorola's software update policy is (still) no match for the competition</h2>
<p>Motorola has finally introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Razr 2025 series</a>, heating up the competition in the foldable space further. And for the first time, the Razr line-up is comprised of not two, but three flip-style foldables. You have the standard Razr 2025, the Razr Plus 2025, and the top-tier Razr Ultra 2025.</p><p>As expected, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025 series</a> will come with numerous improvements, both on the outside and the inside. Among the hardware upgrades are a new titanium hinge that the brand claims should allow for enhanced durability, an IP48 rating across the board for better ingress protection, new colors and finishes (including wood and Alcantara fabric for the Razr Ultra 2025), and more powerful internals.</p><p>Coming to the software, Motorola is going all in with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a>, its own suite of AI-powered tools that work in tandem with Google AI. That's all well and good, but what about the core Android operating system that serves as the foundation for all these advanced Android features?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3984px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ" name="Motorola-Razr-2025-hands-on-3" alt="The Razr 2025 in different colors and finishes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6k29fZHeTa8PYDA4unZvFQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3984" height="2241" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, things remain a tad lackluster in this department. All three members of the Razr 2025 line-up boot <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box, and Motorola has promised three years of major OS updates for the trio. This means you can expect them to be updated to Android 16, 17, and 18 in the future. Apart from that, the brand will also offer four years of bi-monthly security updates for the three foldables.</p><p>While not outright bad, this update policy is nowhere near what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> from rivals such as Google and Samsung are backed by. Strangely enough, one of Motorola's recent launches—the Edge 50 Neo—comes with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-serious-should-we-be-taking-motorolas-five-year-os-update-promise">commitment of five years</a> of major OS and security updates, despite being a mid-range smartphone that costs much less than even the vanilla Razr 2025.</p><p>We can't help but feel that the brand should have done a better job with its latest foldables in terms of software support, which continues to be inconsistent.</p><p>With that said, the Razr 2025 lineup has many good things going for it. While the Razr 2025 and the Razr Plus 2025 can be considered modest upgrades over their respective predecessors, the Razr Ultra 2025 is a proper top-of-the-line device that can go against some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> currently available out there.</p><p>Driven by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC, it comes with 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 1TB of UFS 4.0 storage. The phone sports an enhanced Pantone-validated camera setup, with a 50MP primary sensor and a 50MP ultrawide lens. All modern connectivity and I/O options are included in the mix, and you also get a 4,700mAh battery with fast wired and wireless charging support.</p><p>If only Motorola could improve its software update game, the Razr Ultra 2025 could very well turn out to be a fabulous device, despite its $1,299 asking price.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I test plenty of phones, and I rely on a thermal camera to measure how hot devices get while testing. I use it the most while running extended gaming tests, as that's inevitably when a phone gets hot. This year's devices run hotter too, as evidenced by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Nubia Z70 Ultra</a> hitting a toasty 59 degrees.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="U6gKpca853FvjZtEjr28fe" name="Thermal Master P2" alt="Thermal Master's P2 thermal camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U6gKpca853FvjZtEjr28fe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While having a dedicated thermal camera is great, you get USB-C dongles these days that provide the same utility, and they're just as good. I've been using Thermal Master's P2 for just over a month, and the dongle-sized module has proven to be reliable. The thermal camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Thermal-Android-Resolution-Infrared-Accuracy/dp/B0DP5WSK9G">costs $199 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thermalmaster.com/products/thermal-master-p2">Thermal Master's website</a>, and that's decent considering the quality of the sensor.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="nngsewpo2Y5ztfcXWkgMee" name="Thermal Master P2" alt="Thermal Master's P2 thermal camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nngsewpo2Y5ztfcXWkgMee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The P2 weighs just 10g, and comes in a tiny plastic package with a built-in carabiner attachment, allowing you to hook it to a key ring or bag with ease. The camera connects via USB-C, and I didn't have any issues pairing it with my Vivo X200 Pro, Honor Magic 7 Pro, Find X8 Ultra, and Xiaomi 14.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BgP3VrvRDtN8azmYoRKBee" name="Thermal Master P2" alt="Thermal Master's P2 thermal camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BgP3VrvRDtN8azmYoRKBee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The diminutive size means you can take the P2 anywhere, and it is great in daily use. It has a native resolution of 256x192, but uses a custom algorithm to double it to 512x384, delivering a clean image. I use it to identify hot spots on phones and other gadgets — including notebooks and my iPad Pro M4 — and it is quite effective at doing so. It's able to measure between -4 degrees to 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit, and it gets 15x zoom.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XbJjGG2iGxsA4rWG35H9ee" name="Thermal Master P2" alt="Thermal Master's P2 thermal camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XbJjGG2iGxsA4rWG35H9ee.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that you can manually adjust color palettes — there are 12 available in total. The camera does a great job identifying various zones within an image, and there's an overlay that lets you preview the actual image alongside the thermal view. You can shoot video along with photos, and while the resolution isn't the best, it lets you pick out any hot or cold spots without any issues.</p>
<p>At a power draw of just 0.3W, it doesn't consume much power either.  Ultimately, the smaller size is what makes the Thermal Master P2 noteworthy; while I used other thermal cameras in the past, they're considerably bigger, and the P2 does just as good a job. So if you need a thermal camera to monitor issues in a power line, identify leaks around the house, or see just how hot your devices get, the P2 is a decent enough choice.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Google Pixel 9a</a> launched earlier this month, it ushered in a brand new design and a number of enhancements that made it one of the best Pixel experiences so far. Chief among the improvements is the display's spec sheet, which now looks identical to the more expensive Pixel 9 series in nearly every way.</p><p>While that's great for most users, a subset of the population cannot use any Pixel display without getting serious headaches, and the Pixel 9a didn't do anything to help that. When I asked the company if it would consider upgrading the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> rate or adding a flicker-reduction accessibility option, I fully expected to get the standard "we'll look into this," but never actually hear back. Instead, six weeks later, Google returned an amazing statement I didn't expect.</p><p>"Google...indicated their teams are aware and investigating this. You can expect updates later this year," a Google representative told me.</p><p>Here's why this is significant. Since I've been writing about PWM dimming over the past two years, many companies have been willing to discuss PWM dimming and how their products are working toward improving displays for everyone, including those with accessibility needs.</p><p>Google and Samsung have been <em>completely silent</em> on the issue, no matter how many times I've asked, so this marks the first time that stance has changed for at least one of these companies. And while Google didn't explicitly mention the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a>, it seems quite possible that any updates coming "later this year" regarding displays could line up with the Pixel 10 launch.</p>

<h2 id="why-this-matters-2">Why this matters</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fdvDq4Wwtwb8PFBETyHFwR" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-3" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fdvDq4Wwtwb8PFBETyHFwR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm sensitive to phones that use slow PWM dimming rates and have been for at least the past few years. Every single Google Pixel, Samsung Galaxy, or Apple iPhone with an OLED screen uses PWM dimming. That means the only phones I can use daily without headaches are from brands like OnePlus, Honor, Nothing, and a handful of other brands that have begun to prioritize eye health over pure display quality tests.</p><p>For too many years, displays have been made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-displays-arent-the-gold-standard-you-think-they-are">to ace display quality tests</a> instead of paying attention to the humans who have to use them every day. This includes tricks like slow-rate PWM dimming — often 240Hz or 480Hz — as they allow manufacturers to push brightness levels and color accuracy of OLED screens beyond what was considered feasible just a few years ago. As you might gather, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">this causes health issues</a> among people who are "allergic" to PWM dimming, as I'll refer to it.</p><p>It's worth noting that I have no medical history of headaches, migraines, epilepsy, or other issues that might cause light sensitivity. I've also never worn glasses until summer 2023 when I was diagnosed with an astigmatism in my left eye. In other words, there was no reason to think I would be someone susceptible to flickering lights.</p>

<p>Last summer, I got in contact with a custom kernel developer who was able to find the line of code to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-display-upgrade">change the Pixel 8 Pro's PWM rate</a>. It made the phone usable for me again, but rooting a modern phone isn't a great option if you like making NFC payments or using 2-factor authentication apps, as it violates most app security protocols.</p><p>So, the only real option anyone like me has of using a Pixel phone full-time again is if Google gives users a way to adjust the PWM rate or disable it completely. While some users care more about having top-notch display quality at any cost, I'd rather <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">switch to a minimalist E Ink phone</a> and forego display quality if it means saving my eyes and avoiding physical pain every day.</p><p>Thankfully, I don't have to do anything that extreme. Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review" target="_blank">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> offer dimming rates <strong>8-16x faster</strong> than what Google's latest Pixel phones offer, but Google's change in stance could finally reverse that gap in the spec sheet.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect-from-the-pixel-10-s-display-2">What to expect from the Pixel 10's display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's no reason to think that Google will suddenly deprioritize display quality as its foremost concern for the Pixel 10. I fully expect the Pixel 10 to either stick with 240Hz PWM dimming or go the Galaxy S24/S25 Ultra route and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">upgrade that to 480Hz</a> as the default display configuration. That wouldn't be helpful for PWM-sensitive people at all, as the rate ideally needs to be 1920Hz or higher for it to be comfortable. But this new stance from Google could mean one of several things.</p><p>Google could be adding a new accessibility mode for flicker-sensitive people that reduces the amount of display flicker. Motorola did this with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Motorola Edge Plus 2023</a> phone and has included a "flicker-reduction" feature on every single OLED-equipped phone since then, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">latest Razr 2025 phones</a>. Motorola's full DC-dimming method was unique until Xiaomi and OnePlus offered a similar option a year later, but have yet to offer that option outside of China.</p><p>Google could also offer a hybrid dimming mode that utilizes DC dimming at high brightness and high-Hz PWM dimming at low brightness. This has become the new industry standard among most smartphone brands in 2025, including Nothing, OnePlus, Xiaomi, Honor, Vivo, RealMe, and plenty of others.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4" name="pwm-hero-01" alt="Comparing the dimming technologies between the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL, iPhone 14 Pro Max, OnePlus 13, and Honor Magic 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFWeEisYyaKLFyLH2x9os4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also possible that Google simply upgrades the PWM rate across the board and at all brightness levels. Google, Apple, and most Samsung Galaxy devices currently use PWM dimming at all brightness levels, and while companies like Vivo offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-full-pwm-update">similar "Full PWM" modes</a>, they do it at rates as high as 2140Hz. Again, 5-8x faster than the big three offer.</p><p>Either avenue Google takes is going to be a positive step for all users, not just those of us who have already become sensitive to the harsh PWM dimming associated with some lights and displays. User-selectable options and customization have long been staples of the Android world, and it's always good to see Google considering options for users who <strong>need </strong>them, not just things we might <em>want</em>.</p><p>Of course, the final possibility is that Google could do nothing and that I'm just being overly hopeful. That said, we will have to wait and see what we get when the Pixel 10 launches.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-expands-direct-access-to-ai-assistant-on-galaxy-a-series-with-awesome-intelligence">announced</a> in a press release today that it will be bringing the Gemini summon button, or as it is more commonly called, the side button, to "select Galaxy A series devices."</p><p>The Korean OEM says that this will be rolled out as a new update, starting with the most recent Galaxy A series: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A56 5G</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Galaxy A36 5G, and Galaxy A26 5G</a>. Users with the above-mentioned devices will be able to trigger Google's AI Gemini with just a push of a side button, which is also used as the power button.</p><p>Gemini will work alongside Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence" target="_blank">Awesome Intelligence, </a>which was introduced on the latest Galaxy A series, expanding Galaxy AI experiences to more users.</p><p>This will bring Galaxy's A-series on par with the other Galaxy devices, making it easier for them to utilize all of Gemini's capabilities for their daily tasks more often with the push of a button as opposed to opening the Gemini app and <em>then</em> typing or voicing out the request.</p><p>“We’re excited that Galaxy A series users will now be able to activate Gemini faster and more naturally through a simple gesture that brings intelligent support into the flow of daily tasks,”  said Jay Kim, executive vice president of mobile eXperience business at Samsung Electronics.</p>

<p>It seems like Samsung is further replacing Bixby<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai"> </a>with Google's Gemini as the primary assistant on the A-series. The press release further notes that users can rely on Gemini to make those last-minute dinner reservations or help them look up a French, pet-friendly restaurant in their neighbourhood, among other everyday tasks.</p><p>In the footnotes of the press release, the company states that this update will roll out to only to<em> </em>the "Galaxy A56 5G, A55 5G, A54 5G, A36 5G, A35 5G, A34 5G, A26 5G, A25 5G, A25e 5G and A24 running One UI 7, and is scheduled to begin rolling out in May." However, the rollout time may be subject to change, which has been par for the course regarding Samsung's One UI 7 rollout.</p><p>Speaking about the above collaboration between Samsung and Google, Kim added that “Samsung and Google have been working together to deliver seamless, intuitive, and meaningful AI experiences, making the latest technology more accessible for more users.”</p>

<ul><li>Nothing is gearing up to release the Phone 3 in the third quarter of 2025.</li><li>The company's CEO, Carl Pei, confirmed that Phone 3 will launch in the U.S. outside of the beta program.</li><li>This confirmation means you can expect the Nothing Phone 3 to ship with full support for major U.S. cellular bands and carriers.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Nothing has a complicated relationship with the U.S. market, selling its flagship phones widely in the region but restricting many other offerings to a Nothing Beta Program that lacks official cellular support. Without support for all the major U.S. carriers and by limiting purchasers to Nothing's online store, recent releases like the Phone 3a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Phone 2a series</a> weren't viable options for people in the states.</p><p>With the brand focusing on the midrange market for the past two years, we haven't seen a Nothing-branded smartphone debut in the U.S. officially since the Phone 2 in 2023. The long drought seemingly left fans wondering whether the upcoming Phone 3 would get official support for U.S. cellular bands, as that's what one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Nothing Phone 2</a> user asked the company's CEO on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/1917040614304264507?t=hV3GdAdxhnBK4zpAQKDtZQ&s=19" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">100%! 🇺🇸 https://t.co/jhJ8BQ2MNi<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1917040614304264507">April 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>"Is the Nothing Phone 3 coming to the U.S. besides on your beta channel?," the person asked. "I used the Nothing Phone 2 on Verizon with no issues and I'd love it if I could use the upcoming Nothing Phone 3 also."</p><p>To which the Nothing CEO quote-replied, "100%!," seemingly confirming that the Phone 3 will launch outside the beta program with full U.S. coverage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, Nothing budget phones such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a Pro</a> skip out on CDMA support, ruling out Verizon support of any kind. Additionally, they won't work on the AT&T 5G network, but 4G is supported. Partial or nonexistent support on two of the nation's largest networks is the reason why Nothing opts to launch these phones via the beta program versus traditional channels.</p><p>Luckily, it seems like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">Nothing Phone 3</a> will stick with full support in the U.S. when it releases in the third quarter of this year.</p>

<ul><li>The Meta AI app is a repurposed version of the Meta View app that no longer focuses solely on Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.</li><li>Now, anyone with a Facebook or Meta account will be able to query the Llama 4 model using the Meta AI app.</li><li>Ray-Ban glasses owners will still control their devices through the Meta AI app, but it'll add new smarts like image generation and more conversational responses.</li><li>It's rolling out to Android and iOS users on April 29, though we're not seeing the new changes in the current version yet.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Meta AI app rebrands Meta View, the companion app for Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, into a more general platform for anyone to get daily AI insights. And once Meta finishes rolling out the update on Tuesday, it'll be much more than a fresh coat of paint.</p><p>In its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/04/introducing-meta-ai-app-new-way-access-ai-assistant/">announcement post</a>, Meta explains that Meta AI lets people "experience a personal AI designed around voice conversations with Meta AI inside a standalone app." And it's designed around <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-is-coming-for-google-and-openai-with-its-fresh-llama-4-models">Llama 4</a>, its smartest AI model released in early April with 17 billion active parameters.</p><p>Originally designed to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a>, the Meta AI app will continue to enable features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ray-bans-roll-out-live-ai-and-live-translation-add-new-frames-and-apps">Live Translation and Live AI discussions</a>, except now you can "pick up where you left off" a Ray-Ban discussion on your phone in the History tab.</p><p>While the current Meta View / AI app only works with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">smart glasses</a>, the version rolling out today is meant to incorporate Meta AI directly into the Home tab for anyone, with or without smart glasses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="W38mwrtyoDDCmYuBkwuAai" name="Meta-AI-changelog" alt="The Meta AI changelog in the Google Play app, showing the new features as it pivots from the Ray-Ban focused Meta View app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W38mwrtyoDDCmYuBkwuAai.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Meta AI app now integrates image generation and editing, along with standard Meta AI questions via voice or text. Ray-Ban Meta owners can take a photo and have the Meta AI "add, remove, or change parts of the image." Users without glasses can still create images to export to social media apps like Instagram.</p><p>More generally, the Llama 4-backed Meta AI is supposed to be more "personal and relevant, and more conversational in tone."</p><p>In the U.S. and Canada, Meta AI will allow for "personalized responses." It will recall past queries or things you tell it to remember, while also taking into account your interests from other Meta apps like Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>Another new Meta AI app feature is a Discover feed, where "you can see the best prompts people are sharing, or remix them to make them your own." You'll only see prompts that people publicly post, so don't worry about your private Meta AI queries showing up on someone else's phone.</p><p>Lastly, Meta is promising a "voice demo built with full-duplex speech technology" in the Meta AI app. The gist is that this demo "delivers a more natural voice experience trained on conversational dialogue, so the AI is generating voice directly instead of reading written responses."</p>

<p>Meta published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/beyond-turn-based-interfaces-synchronous-llms-as-full-duplex-dialogue-agents/">white paper about conversational AI</a> last year, describing the benefits of "quick and dynamic turn-taking, overlapping speech, and backchanneling" to create "meaningful and natural spoken dialogue" instead of AI's typical "half-duplex" method of waiting for the user to stop talking before replying.</p><p>The Meta AI full-duplex demo isn't capable of remembering information yet, and it's only available in the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. But it sounds like an intriguing, building rival to the conversation flow of Gemini Live.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/ray-ban-meta-ai-glasses-new-companion-app/">separate blog post</a>, Meta promised current Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses owners that "the core features you’ve come to know" in the Meta View app "will stay the same," and your current photos and settings will migrate to the new app without issue.</p><p>Oddly, while both the Play Store and App Store show the "Meta AI" app in search results, the current updated version doesn't reflect the changelog and still requires Ray-Ban glasses to do anything.</p><p>We assume these changes should finish rolling out soon, and we're excited to test them. Meta AI and its Llama 4 model will challenge other standalone AI apps like Gemini and ChatGPT.</p>

<p>Google is rolling out a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-pixel-weather-app-just-got-a-handy-update-for-unit-measurements">Pixel Weather app</a> update that adds a pollen tracker for U.S. users, as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/28/pixel-weather-pollen-us/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The tracker features intuitive charts that show daily pollen levels on a scale of 0 to 4. It also breaks down individual pollen levels for grasses, trees, and weeds.</p><p>The pollen tracker was first announced as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-october-2024-feature-drop">October 2024 Pixel Feature Drop</a>, but was limited to users in the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, and Italy.

<p>Google is reportedly rolling out a huge TV Streamer smart home feature to its past-gen streaming dongle.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/28/home-panel-begins-rolling-out-to-chromecast-with-google-tv/">9to5Google</a> highlights the sudden appearance of Google's "Home Panel" rolling out for Chromecast with Google TV users. The publication claims it's spotted the update's rollout over the past couple of days. Moreover, Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/15158065?hl=en&sjid=9919626332020515979-NA">published a support page</a> for the feature, likely confirming its wider rollout for users. The main purpose of this feature is for users to control "compatible" smart home devices from their TV.</p><p>Google states users will find support for lights, thermostats, locks, cameras, plugs, vacuums, TVs, and speakers.</p><p>As this hits more TV sets, the post states users should see a welcome screen upon their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">Chromecast with Google TV's</a> "initial launch." The Home Panel is an opt-in feature, and users can agree to it from this welcoming splash screen. However, you can always turn it on/off by heading into <strong>Settings > Account & Sign in > User Profile > Google Home</strong>.</p><p>Interested parties should ensure their smart home devices are connected in their Home app and that they're TV is using the same Google account. The Home Panel will display any connected lights and cameras first with your "Favorites" and others listed below.</p>

<p>Google also highlights a few issues users might encounter, such as an error message when opening the Home Panel or an inability to access its settings. It states these issues may occur if your Google account is new, in which case you'll need to wait ~36 hours. If these issues persist, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googletv/answer/15158065?hl=en&sjid=9919626332020515979-NA#zippy=%2Cclear-data-and-reload-the-google-tv-and-ambient-mode-apps:~:text=If%20you%27re%20still%20having%20issues%2C%20follow%20the%20instructions%20below.">you should check out these steps</a>.</p><p>As previously stated, the Home Panel arrived as a core feature with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamer-launch">Google TV Streamer's</a> launch last August. The streaming "box" is Google's next-gen product, aiming to step in for the old Chromecast. Shortly after its launch, Google updated its TV experience by introducing Gemini for show summaries, season breakdowns, and more. More importantly, the TV Streamer's Home Panel was highlighted as a new feature coming for older Chromecasts.</p><p>However, the feature was originally popped into the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamers-best-feature-comes-to-more-streaming-devices">Public Preview test realm</a>. It gave users a chance to sign up and test the feature before its eventual wider availability. Google was also testing the Home Panel with TCL and Hisense.</p>

<p>There's a great deal of caution surrounding this new Galaxy Z Fold 7 leak, so take what you've read with caution. Let's also backtrack and remember that the next Fold is suspected to be thinner, following rumors that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-design-s-pen-digitizer-south-korean-rumors">Samsung would drop its S Pen digitizer</a>. The reason was to produce a thinner foldable phone as removing the S Pen would (in theory) reduce its thickness by ~0.6mm. A more substantial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-fold-7-renderings-specs-hardware-changes-leaked">rendering leak</a> surfaced in February, delivering more info about its purported measurements.</p><p>Speculation stated the Fold 7, with larger 8.2-inch (internal) and 6.5-inch (cover) displays, could be 9mm thin when folded. Factoring in the small camera bump takes that up to ~9.5mm. As 9to5 notes, the current rumors portray the Fold 7 as a true thin competitor to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">OPPO's Find N5</a>, which is 8.9mm thin.</p><p>While it seems like Samsung is moving toward a thinner foldable, as it's done with its slab phones, just how thin is up in the air.</p><p>For now, we can turn our attention to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">other rumors from April</a> that claim the device could sport One UI 8 (Android 16) when it launches. Tipsters suggest the company is also looking at upgrading the phone's UDC (under-display camera), while keeping its costs in mind. More pressing camera specs include a 200MP primary lens upgrade.</p>

<p>One of the hallmark traits of the CMF Phone 1 was that it felt like a phone twice the price in the most important respects. From general performance to camera quality, an excellent display, and even a unique build, the CMF Phone 1 quickly became our favorite budget phone of 2024.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-phone-2-pro-review">CMF Phone 2 Pro</a> follows up with a slight price increase and a significant quality improvement, once again pushing the boundaries of what's expected from a sub-$300 phone. While the phone features improvements across the board, three features have stood out to me since I started using it last week.</p><p>Chief among these is the camera experience, followed closely by a significantly improved display. The third doesn't take as much analysis to explain, but it positively affects the experience palpably: the haptics.</p><p>Haptics on the CMF Phone 1 felt like those of every other cheap phone on the market — straight-up awful — but the CMF Phone 2 Pro upgrades the haptics to match the rest of Nothing's more expensive portfolio, and it rounds out a trio of upgrades worth celebrating.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everything about the CMF Phone 2 Pro's display is better than the panel on the CMF Phone 1. While both are AMOLED panels, the CMF Phone 2 Pro doesn't exhibit the slight rainbow color shift that is visible when tilting the Phone 1's display at an angle. The bezels are also noticeably thinner, and while they're not <em>quite</em> as thin as a flagship phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, they're thinner than basically any other phone you'd expect to find in this price range.</p><p>Additionally, Nothing nearly doubled this phone's brightness levels and the PWM rate compared to the first generation model. The CMF Phone 1 achieves a brightness of nearly 900 lux at 100%, while the CMF Phone 2 Pro reaches nearly 1400 lux with the same settings. HDR mode will see the display hit near 3000 nits in the brightest areas. I can't see brightness getting any better in this class.</p><p>The display isn't LTPO, so it doesn't feature the better energy savings found in more expensive OLED panels, but it can dynamically shift from 30Hz to 120Hz — in 30Hz increments — when needed. You can also lock the refresh rate at 60Hz by selecting "Standard" in the display settings. Locking to 120Hz, however, requires enabling the "Force peak refresh rate" setting in Developer Options. LTPO would make things even better, but I don't see that being realistic in this price range.</p>

<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro follows in the footsteps of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a series</a>, featuring a more eye-friendly display that should work nicely for anyone sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>. The CMF Phone 2 Pro uses DC dimming at 50% brightness and above, sporting 7-15% modulation at 60Hz, while 120Hz roughly doubles those numbers. Very sensitive users should stick with 60Hz since it's the most flicker-free option.</p><p>Regardless of the refresh rate, the phone switches to 2160Hz PWM dimming at 49% brightness and below. This is 10 times faster than phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Google Pixel 9a</a>, making it significantly more comfortable in the dark and far better for your eyes over time.</p><p>Overall, this is an excellent display and is essentially unmatched in this price range. I would expect this level of quality from a $500 phone, not a sub-$300 one.</p>

<p>One of the reasons for the "Pro" moniker in the phone's name is the camera performance. A rear triple-camera system with a manual camera mode qualifies it for this naming convention, and the results certainly feel more in line with similarly named phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NUU-B30-AMOLED-Selfie-Dimensity/dp/B0CSSTZSFX?th=1">Nuu B30 Pro</a>.</p><p>Compared to the CMF Phone 1, the CMF Phone 2 upgrades the main 50MP camera with dual-pixel PDAF and a larger 1/1.57” sensor with 1.0-micron-sized pixels. That's in comparison to the 1/1.95" sensor with 0.8-micron-sized pixels on the CMF Phone 1. The CMF Phone 2 Pro also features a new 1/2.88” 50MP 2x telephoto camera and a 1/4” 8MP ultrawide sensor. The only sensor that remains unchanged is the 16MP selfie camera.</p><p>However, before we delve into quality comparisons, it's worth noting that Nothing has given the camera UI a slight overhaul to add features and, in some cases, make it more user-friendly. List-style menus have been revamped to a more standard tile style.</p><p>While I appreciate the visual change, I prefer the previous style, which presented all the options upfront. With this new design, you have to tap each tile an unknown number of times to cycle through all the available options. I don't find either design to be more or less friendly for one-handed use.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2160px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:110.74%;"><img id="8Akh7k98UPi98G8YgktASQ" name="cmf-phone-1-vs-cmf-phone-2-pro-camera-ui" alt="Comparing the quick settings on CMF Phone 1 vs CMF Phone 2 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8Akh7k98UPi98G8YgktASQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2160" height="2392" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">New isn't always better, as the CMF Phone 1's camera quick settings UI offered a better at-a-glance settings menu. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The settings overhaul may not be an improvement, but the new Presets feature is a significant enhancement that should spark some interesting community creativity. The phone comes with four pre-installed Presets — Soft Focus portrait, B&W Film, Wide Angle, and Lenticular — and it's as easy as pie to import or create your own Preset.</p><p>Presets include a cover photo, name and description, camera mode, front or rear lens, and focal length selection, exposure value, filters, and even advanced settings. This, coupled with the powerful manual camera mode, helps make the "Pro" moniker make more sense than some other Pro phones.</p><p>A new portrait lighting engine was added, offering five different types of bokeh and lighting looks; however, I struggled to discern a noticeable difference between any of these in practice.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The new Presets feature is a significant enhancement that should spark some interesting community creativity.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>On the quality side, the CMF Phone 2 Pro is mostly an improvement over Phone 1. The inclusion of an ultrawide-angle camera gives you more control over your shots and video. The ultrawide camera and the front-facing camera are both limited to 1080p30 quality, while the main and telephoto sensors can push 4k30 or 1080p60 video.</p><p>The ultrawide camera on the CMF Phone 2 Pro is quite good and has surprisingly excellent dynamic range. It doesn't double as a macro camera like some other ultrawide-angle cameras do, but that's usually reserved for more expensive phones, anyway.</p><p>The new 50MP telephoto camera noticeably enhances zoom performance compared to the original phone. While it's only a 2x lens, the phone can perform "lossless" 4x zoom thanks to pixel binning. I've found that quality degrades beyond 6x zoom, although you can find notable quality differences between Phone 1 and Phone 2 up to 10x zoom.</p>

<p>Nothing has improved its HDR algorithm from the CMF Phone 1, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro typically exhibits a very wide dynamic range from all camera lenses. This means, for example, that subjects are illuminated well while keeping the sky blue and natural instead of grey and overly bright.</p><p>However, there are times when something is amiss with it. In one scenario, pictured below, a picture of a flower had very strange, overly bright artifacts across the brightest parts of the image. In another indoor scenario, the lights were blown out, but the bright white shirts that some people wore looked perfectly balanced. Nothing has a little bit of fine-tuning to do here, but it's generally an improvement over Phone 1's dynamic range.</p>

<p>Color accuracy appears to improve during the day, but a distinct warm shift occurs in low light. The CMF Phone 1 also does this, but the Phone 2 Pro is slightly warmer than that. Neither phone takes great pictures of moving subjects, but I was able to snap a few decent ones of my pets and son, so not all is bad.</p><p>The front-facing camera is pretty hit-or-miss. When HDR is required, the front-facing camera is a significant improvement, as illustrated in one example below. At other times, the quality appears worse than that of the CMF Phone 1, despite using the same sensor, as the Phone 2 Pro's image tends to look softer. This will likely get fixed in a software update down the road.</p>

<p>Overall, if you're upgrading from CMF Phone 1 or just choosing a new budget phone, know that Nothing has most improved the dynamic range, color accuracy during the day, added an ultrawide-angle camera, and improved zoom detail by a notable amount from the telephoto camera.</p><p>Aside from that, the CMF Phone 2 Pro boasts a superior build, enhanced display, improved haptics, additional accessories, and a more refined overall experience compared to the first-generation release.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google announced in a press release today (April 29) that it is expanding the Digital ID access via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> to the residents in the U.K. They are joining several states in the U.S., where residents can save their driver’s licenses and state IDs in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>Residents will soon be able to create digital ID passes with their U.K. passports and securely and conveniently store them in Google Wallet. This move makes it seamless for people to verify their identity just with a tap of a button on their phones, rather than pulling out their physical IDs each time.</p><p>To start, Google says it is partnering with the U.K.'s Rail Delivery Group, offering train travellers the opportunity to use their digital ID while travelling. However, it is important to note that these digital IDs are not a replacement for the original physical ones. Furthermore, U.K. residents cannot use digital IDs at airports for travel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c9XDfrBENkbE4bfTJ4ZgQf" name="Google-wallet-UK-digital-IDs" alt="Google Wallet IDs UK" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c9XDfrBENkbE4bfTJ4ZgQf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, Google states that it is also exploring certification with the U.K.’s Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology, which could enable residents to use their digital IDs for alcohol purchases and other purposes.</p><p>Adding your U.K. passport to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-wallet">Google Wallet</a> is super easy. All you need to do is open the app, tap <strong>"Add to Wallet</strong>,<strong>"</strong> pick <strong>"ID</strong>,<strong>"</strong> and follow the steps. The process is likely very similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-add-passport-id-google-wallet">adding a U.S. passport to Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>The app will prompt you to take photos of both sides of your ID and record a quick selfie video for verification. In a few minutes, you’ll receive a notification that your digital ID is ready to use. Once it’s set up, you can access it just like you do other payment cards.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cGNYGkYbhKEJAo4Vn8ygUG" name="Google-Wallet-Passport-Setup.jpg" alt="Creating a passport pass in Google Wallet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cGNYGkYbhKEJAo4Vn8ygUG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, Google is bringing an additional layer of protection when it comes to keeping data private. It has integrated a software called Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology into Google Wallet. This ensures that the website or apps you use to verify your identity cannot be traced back to you with the help of your information.</p><p>This technology works in tandem with the Google Wallet, allowing users to verify their identity and age simultaneously in apps like Bumble. Google says this is to "help foster a safer, more secure environment for everyone." The tech giant will also open-source their integration of ZKP technology to other wallets and online services in the future.</p>

<p>Google is expanding its digital IDs access to Arkansas, Montana, Puerto Rico, and West Virginia, which will soon be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-add-drivers-license-state-id-google-wallet">add government-issued digital IDs to Google Wallet</a>.</p><p>The tech giant is also expanding the eligibility of its digital IDs to other services in Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, and New Mexico. For instance, users will be able to use their mobile IDs at the DMV for improved and streamlined customer experiences.</p><p>Residents in the above-mentioned states can use their digital ID pass, created from a U.S. passport, for domestic travel with TSA security at supported airports, even if they do not have a driver's license or state-issued ID.</p><p>Soon, users will also be able to use the digital ID to recover Amazon accounts, access online health services with CVS and MyChart by Epic, verify profiles on platforms like Uber, and more.</p><p>Lastly, Google Wallet is being expanded to 50 more countries, where users to view and use digital passes in the app and on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wallet.google.com/wallet/home?utm_source=marketing&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=keyword_042825">web</a>, even where tap-to-pay isn't available yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-102">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Starting May 1, Bark and Talkspace are bringing wellness tools straight to teens’ screens.</li><li>Bark Phone and app users get instant access to videos, exercises, and self-help stuff made by real therapists.</li><li>Talkspace Go is like a therapist in your pocket with quick videos and guided tools, and it's free with Bark.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>In a world where teens are glued to their screens, two companies are teaming up to make mental health support as easy as opening an app.</p><p>Starting May 1, Bark Technologies and Talkspace, a therapy-on-your-phone provider, are joining forces to bring mental health resources directly to teens’ devices.</p><p>As part of the partnership, every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ive-tried-many-popular-kids-phones-and-this-one-is-the-best">Bark Phone</a>—and even Bark app users—will gain free access to Talkspace’s teen-focused wellness content. That means self-guided exercises, bite-sized videos, and practical tools built by licensed therapists will now be a tap away for kids 13 and up.</p>
<h2 id="bark-s-already-spotting-the-red-flags-2">Bark's already spotting the red flags</h2>
<p>Why is this a big deal? Well, the stats are kinda scary.  Apparently, a huge chunk (40%) of high schoolers have been feeling super down or hopeless, as per the CDC's statistics.  And a ton of kids who need mental health help aren't getting it.</p><p>Bark’s own data backs this up, showing that a lot of teens are dealing with bullying and depression.</p><p>Bark’s tech is already scanning billions of online activities for red flags like bullying, depression, and threats. The company found that 77% of teens ran into bullying and 43% showed signs of depression. So adding mental health resources directly into Bark Phones is like finally putting a fire extinguisher next to the smoke detector.</p><p>Teens can use Talkspace Go, which is like a library of self-help resources with videos and exercises created by actual therapists. It's free when you use it on a Bark Phone, which is among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-kids">best phones for kids</a>.</p>
<h2 id="need-real-therapy-that-s-covered-too-2">Need real therapy? That’s covered too</h2>
<p>Talkspace therapy is also an option, and if you have insurance, it might even be covered. Talkspace will match teens (13+) with a therapist they can connect with through messaging, video, or both. Teens can register with an email to access Talkspace Go.</p><p>Schools and districts are also getting in on the action. Thousands already rely on Bark to keep tabs on student activity across platforms like Google Workspace and Chrome. Now they can layer on Talkspace services to support mental wellness, not just monitor risk.</p>

<hr>
<p>After its successful launch in the Chinese region last week, the OnePlus 13T is likely to enter other markets, including India, but with a different moniker.</p><p>OnePlus India has started teasing a new product launch, dubbed OnePlus 13s, and the teased images indicate that it is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-smal-display-flagship-power-china-launch">OnePlus 13T</a>. It is interesting to see the company choosing the “s” suffix, which happens to be the first time in the company’s product portfolio ever since its inception.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A synergy of power and proportion.

<p>The OnePlus 13T was released in China as a compact phone with a smaller display than its siblings. Yet, it has powerful internals to compete with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones" target="_blank">best Android flagships</a> available in the market. The OnePlus 13s is also confirmed to sport the same 6.32-inch display and compact form factor. It will also be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which powers the flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>OnePlus in India has just started teasing the upcoming device’s launch on social media and has also listed it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.in/launch/13s">on its website</a> with a caption, “Powered up, sized down” and “A synergy of power and proportion”. The device launch is yet to be determined, as the teaser indicates that it is only “coming soon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, OnePlus has started its rewards program to encourage users to get the OnePlus 13s bundled with Buds Pro 3 headphones. Also, the company wants its users to opt for an exchange program and an easy upgrade program to get its new OnePlus flagship.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8" name="oneplus-13t-color-options" alt="The OnePlus 13T in a variety of colors: Morning Grey, Heart-pounding Pink, Cloudy Ink Black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sntr7kq696UZSt5QjApUx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the uninitiated, the OnePlus 13s is also expected to weigh around 185 grams and ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review" target="_blank">Android 15</a> based OxygenOS 15 out of the box. It could sport dual 50MP cameras with a new camera visor that moves away from the conventional circular camera visor. A 16MP selfie camera is also expected.</p><p>The highlight of the upcoming handset is, however, the massive 6260mAh battery capacity, which is the company’s proprietary Glacier battery with support for 80W fast charging. OnePlus did an amazing job with the OnePlus 13T by including this giant battery despite being the device featuring a pretty compact design.</p>

It's easy to forget that Motorola, not Samsung, pushed the boundaries of flip-style foldables by introducing larger cover screens and more flexible software.</p><p>And yet, Samsung clearly got the details right, leveraging its years of experience developing foldables to create Galaxy Z Flip products with superior build quality compared to Motorola Razr phones. That's part of the reason my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2023-how-it-started-how-its-going">Motorola Razr Plus 2023</a> — a phone I purchased with my own money — didn't stick. With a fragile hinge and tons of wobble, the Razr Plus 2023 ended up feeling more like a kid's toy than a Samsung competitor.</p><p>Fast-forward two years, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2025-series-hands-on">Motorola Razr Ultra 2025</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/razr-2025-series-emulates-samsungs-three-product-strategy">Razr Plus 2025</a> unsurprisingly trounce my old Razr Plus 2023. However, after a closer look, I was shocked to discover that even the base-model Razr 2025 will beat my Razr Plus 2023. If that isn't a clear indication of Motorola's progress with foldables, I don't know what is.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-1" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGhva8Br3mE9YRczDTadyM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When Motorola first released a base-model Razr, it was a pared-down version of the Plus model with a cover screen that wasn't very useful and limited functionality overall. Over the past few years, the company has been steadily bringing "Plus" features to the standard Razr, and it's paying off. The Razr 2025, which costs $699, will handily outperform a Razr Plus 2023 that cost $1,000 just a few years ago.</p><p>For me, it starts with what most people would describe as the intangibles. These aren't things like processor speed, camera quality, or display technology. Instead, they're build quality, durability, and overall feel — areas that the Razr Plus 2023 struggled so deeply at that it became unusable as a daily driver for me. These are precisely the aspects of the Razr 2025 that are significantly improved.</p><p>For starters, Motorola's hinge quality has come a long way, and this year's units are now reinforced with titanium as opposed to stainless steel in older units. I've yet to try the Razr 2025, but my colleagues tell me that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-vs-razr-plus-2024" target="_blank">Motorola's hinge on the 2024 and especially the 2025 models</a> is sturdier and more satisfying, even if not quite on Samsung's level. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/is-the-motorola-razr-2025-waterproof" target="_blank">the Razr 2025 features an IP48 certification</a>, which adds dust resistance — a feature sorely missing in earlier iterations.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2023-3" alt="The Motorola Plus 2023 showing the display and hinge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sc9eyUbUzHfkfEH5dC2uPN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As an early adopter who had been burned by subpar build quality on the Motorola Plus 2023, those Razr 2025 improvements are enough to make me consider an upgrade. The thing is, there are plenty more enhancements worth noting. The new 4,500mAh capacity has to be near the top of the list. It's significantly more than the 3,800mAh inside my Razr Plus 2023, and it's even more than the Razr Plus 2024 <em>and</em> 2025 offer.</p><p>In practice, this should help the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a> last all day, and the 15W wireless charging speeds will help you power up quickly. That's up from the 5W available on the Razr Plus 2023.</p><p>If that wasn't enough, we can't forget that the primary camera on the Razr 2025 is a 50MP, f/1.7 lens that will vastly outperform the 12MP primary sensor on the Razr Plus 2023.</p>

<p>By this point, you might be wondering whether it's really a shock that the Razr 2025 will crush the Razr Plus 2023 in terms of features and value. After all, the latter is now almost two years old. Believe it or not, the answer is yes, it's absolutely surprising.</p><p>All it takes to prove that is a look at what Apple and Samsung are doing with their budget phones. The iPhone SE is a laughingstock, lacking even MagSafe compatibility, and the Galaxy A56 might be worse — our Android Central editor Harish Jonnalagadda <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-a56-is-the-worst-mid-range-phone-i-used-in-2025">called it "the worst midrange phone" he used this year</a>.</p><p>Put simply, companies rarely rush to improve their mid-range and base-model phones. It takes a hungry brand, like Motorola, that's desperately fighting for market share to do that. It's remarkable that a $699 foldable released in 2025 can outperform a flagship foldable that's barely two years old.</p><p>As someone who loves the <em>idea</em> of the Motorola Razr Plus 2023 but not the execution, I feel compelled to upgrade to a Razr 2025 series phone. Although it's easy to want the best, my gut is telling me to pick the Razr 2025 over the Plus and Ultra variants. The base model is a massive upgrade over the Razr I have now, so why wouldn't I?</p>

<ul><li>A month after it's initial announcement, the AYANEO Pocket ACE is officially available for pre-order.</li><li>Powered by the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2, this is arguably the most powerful 4.5-inch gaming handheld we've seen.</li><li>You can pre-order the Pocket ACE via the Indiegogo campaign with prices starting at ~$343 for the base 8GB/128GB model.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Now might not be the best time to release a new gaming handheld, but all of the tariff nonsense isn't stopping AYANEO. The company unwrapped any remaining details regarding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Pocket ACE</a>, including configurations and pricing.</p><p>We already knew that AYANEO's latest handheld would be on the smaller side, thanks to its 4.5-inch IPS display, which features a resolution of 1620 x 1080. The borderless design should help make the screen feel bigger than it is, as we've seen with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-s-review">Pocket S</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-evo-pre-orders">Pocket EVO</a>.</p>

<p>For retro gamers, this might just be the ultimate gaming handheld thanks to its compact form factor paired with the 3:2 "Golden Ratio" display. This is considered by many to be perfect for retro games, as it strikes the right balance between the 4:3 aspect ratio of original consoles and the 16:9 aspect ratio that is utilized today. As a result, the 3:2 screen of the Pocket ACE results in games filling more of the display, relying less on black bars or having stretched content.</p><p>Additionally, the Pocket ACE is easily the most compact "flagship" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles" target="_blank">gaming handheld</a> to be released. While it misses out on the Snapdragon G3 Gen 3, which will debut later this year in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneos-next-flagship-gaming-handheld-is-coming-soon">Pocket S2</a>, the Snapdragon G3x Gen 2 is no slouch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6820px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-3" alt="All three AYANEO Pocket ACE Colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7XZbXF7xYb6JN75fNbTJ2Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6820" height="3836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the same chip found in the AYANEO Pocket S, and it is essentially an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. This is important as it is largely considered the "standard" for Android gaming due to the community support in custom drivers paired with the current crop of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulators</a>.</p><p>With that, the Pocket ACE is available in four different configurations, starting with an 8GB/128GB combination. It maxes out with the Pocket ACE Retro Power Edition, equipped with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of expandable storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F3BLFrpwCyqE5wTdFukBuY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-11" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE two player gameplay" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F3BLFrpwCyqE5wTdFukBuY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also a good chance that this handheld will be a beast when it comes to battery life. AYANEO managed to fit a 6,000mAh battery, along with active cooling and 40W PD charging, into the Pocket ACE. While AYANEO didn't specify how long it's estimated to last, we suspect that you'll be able to use it for a couple of days before needing to charge it back up.</p><p>Now for arguably the most important piece of the puzzle: the price. During the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>, the base model is priced at $339, rising to $459 upon campaign conclusion. Here's how pricing shakes out for all four configurations:</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4999px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY" name="ayaneo-pocket-ace-announced-5" alt="AYANEO Pocket ACE Retro Power hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNm28wpUrZWkGYWmonAyqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4999" height="2812" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Based on the table above, it appears that the 12GB/256GB version offers the best value. This is the steepest discount of the four, offering a $120 savings if you pre-order during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/pocket-ace-4-5-screen-powerful-retro-handheld#/">Indiegogo campaign</a>. Considering that the device features a built-in microSD card slot, you won't have to worry about storage limitations.</p><p>When will the Pocket ACE actually make its way into our hands? According to the IGG Campaign, it's estimated to begin shipping sometime next month. Now, we just have to hope that the ongoing political climate doesn't get in the way of us being able to enjoy the latest AYANEO offering.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Nothing delivered a hit last year with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>; the phone had an interesting design and modularity, and it nailed the basics. The brand is looking to build on that with the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which delivers decent upgrades in most areas. The most notable addition is a 50MP tele lens at the back as well as an 8MP wide-angle module that joins the main 50MP camera, and it gives the CMF Phone 2 Pro versatility like no other budget phone today. <br><br>You also get an AMOLED panel with ultra-thin bezels — similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-best-budget-phone-india">3a Pro</a> — a decent-sized battery, IP54 ingress protection, and the best software of any budget phone available today. The best part is that Nothing is continuing its value-focused push, and the Phone 2 Pro costs just a smidgen more than its predecessor. <br><br>Is this the budget phone of 2025, then? Without a shadow of a doubt.</p>

<p>Nothing unveiled the CMF Phone 2 Pro at a global launch event in India on April 28, and the phone is slated to go on sale in the country starting May 5. The good news is that it costs just ₹18,999 ($223) for the variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, and that's just ₹1,000 ($12) more than what the Phone 1 debuted at last year. Nothing is also selling the device in an 8GB/256GB configuration at ₹20,999 ($246), and both models retain the MicroSD card slot — a great move in 2025. <br><br>Annoyingly, the device isn't launching in the U.S., with Nothing making the 8GB/256GB variant available as part of the beta initiative for $279. Thankfully, the device will be on sale in the U.K. and other markets in the region, debuting at £219 ($293) for the 8GB/128GB edition and £249 ($333) for the 8GB/256GB model. In Germany, it's launching at €249 ($283) for the 8GB/128GB variant, and €279 ($317) for 8GB/256GB.</p>

<p>Nothing's mainline phones stand out for their designs, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro is no different. While it doesn't feature a similar design language, the bold colors and vibrant accents give the phone a good presence, and the design belies the price tag. I haven't used an entry-level phone that looks this good, and if you want a device that turns heads, you'll need to get the orange model.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="uk8ozwxA4tsSCCfKjBho8W" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uk8ozwxA4tsSCCfKjBho8W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I got the green version of the CMF Phone 2 Pro, and it has a back that mimics a frosted-glass finish. The black version uses the same texture, with the white model delivering a sandstone-like matte texture instead. The orange color, meanwhile, has a metallic sheen, and looks very distinctive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="WFuk3r5jtjRVxhLxSnDH7W" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WFuk3r5jtjRVxhLxSnDH7W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another distinction is the dimensions; coming in at 7.8mm, the Phone 2 Pro is the thinnest Nothing phone yet, and at 185g, it is 12g lighter than the CMF Phone 1 — there's a noticeable difference between the two when it comes to in-hand feel. The back has smooth curves where it meets the mid-frame, and it has good weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MpYyaaABZD2njPMWq5z6yV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MpYyaaABZD2njPMWq5z6yV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, Nothing added the Essential Key to the Phone 2 Pro as well; the dedicated button debuted on the Phone 3a Pro this year, and it allows you to launch Essential Space, a dashboard that lets you save notes, images, and just about anything else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5105px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.49%;"><img id="LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LdMbuqp5uUucY8MkgUZJCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5105" height="2884" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rear camera design is accentuated by bright rings around each module, and it gives additional flair to the design — not that it needed it. A key difference this year is that the back is fully sealed; this allowed the brand to achieve an IP54 ingress protection. Nothing co-founder Akis Evangelidis revealed during a briefing that the device is water-resistant, but that it didn't go through the requisite IP testing.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b6nh5Mb2XyyEGJU7TyBfRW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the back cover is no longer detachable, the CMF Phone 2 Pro doesn't quite have the same level of modularity as its predecessor. That said, Nothing is debuting a universal case that attaches to the back, and it enables the use of several accessories. This time around, the accessories include a kickstand that connects magnetically to the universal case, a macro lens, fisheye lens, and a lanyard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="x6ig9gUuynzxyATLTJncgW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x6ig9gUuynzxyATLTJncgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Attaching the accessories is about as easy as it gets once you affix the universal case to the back of the Phone 2 Pro. While I generally liked using the universal case, it doesn't confirm to the curves at the back, and it has a distinct plastic feel to it. It's a good way to enable the use of custom accessories, and for what it's worth, the Phone 2 Pro as a whole has a design that looks much more polished.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="M776xpmAyaeUrktbydfWbW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M776xpmAyaeUrktbydfWbW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing is using a similar-sized 6.77-inch FHD+ AMOLED panel as last year, but it went with a flexible AMOLED on the Phone 2 Pro, resulting in thinner and even bezels on all sides. Evangelidis noted that the switch to a flexible AMOLED added to the device's manufacturing costs, but as the brand wanted to retain parity with its mainline phones, it used the costlier panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CrHTcCFydURydtXqaYhmhW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's also greater flexibility with panel refresh, with the Phone 2 Pro able to switch between 30Hz, 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz. The device even gets 2,160Hz PWM dimming, and the panel itself is the best of any budget phone around. I didn't run into any issues during regular use or while gaming, and Nothing did all the right things in this area.</p>

<p>My colleague Nick Sutrich tested the device's PWM dimming, and noted that it was more than double that of the CMF Phone 1 at low brightness, which is great. When you boost the brightness to over 50%, you get DC dimming as standard.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="YfK395UTkLuxtd34mmRGKW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YfK395UTkLuxtd34mmRGKW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5119" height="2883" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing is once again using MediaTek's Dimensity 7300 Pro this generation, and the platform is clearly showing its age; I haven't used a phone with the older Cortex A78 and A55 cluster in a while. That said, Nothing did a decent job optimizing the platform, and there isn't any noticeable lag in regular use.</p>

<p>The phone is passable at gaming too, and while you don't get smooth framerates, there isn't too much jitter, and it is usable if you turn down the settings. That said, I'd strongly recommend picking up the Phone 3a Pro if you're looking at a budget-focused gaming device — it does a much better job in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="h8Hu7HLuyA3SjPd7nXLGgW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8Hu7HLuyA3SjPd7nXLGgW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of that, the notable inclusion is a MicroSD slot; the base variant's 128GB storage is decent enough, and while 8GB of memory is usable, Nothing should have rolled out a 12GB/256GB variant at least. You don't get AptX codecs, but there's the standard Bluetooth 5.3, and I didn't see any problems with connectivity. <br><br>Nothing didn't change anything on the battery side of things, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro retains a 5000mAh battery with 33W fast charging. Interestingly, the Indian model now includes a charger in the box — Nothing says its userbase in the country was vocal about its inclusion — but other regions miss out on the same. You can use any USB PD charger with the device, and in general, I got a day's worth of use comfortably.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="SkoWKwnu7Z9SbnTJjbhYuV" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SkoWKwnu7Z9SbnTJjbhYuV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro gets a trio of cameras at the back, including a 50MP main lens, 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom, and an 8MP wide-angle lens. That's a big deal in itself considering most phones in this category have just a single usable camera, and it's good to see the brand providing decent versatility.<br><br>The camera interface is pretty basic, but you get access to all the shooting modes and toggles. It takes 4K30 video, and while the video quality isn't particularly great, it is usable. There's a decent number of shooting modes, and the phone does a passable job with portraits.</p>

<p>Daylight shots have good detail and color vibrancy, and I didn't see any issues in this area. What I like the most is how well the CMF Phone 2 Pro handles low-light imagery; even in challenging conditions, it delivered photos with good colors and little to no visible noise. The wide-angle and 2x tele lenses are good in their own right, and if you need a little extra, Nothing has macro and fisheye lens attachments. <br><br>The fisheye lens is fun to use, but I didn't see much utility out of the macro module. Overall, the camera on the CMF Phone 2 Pro is the best you'll find on a sub-$300 phone, and Nothing deserves credit for bundling a strong package.</p>

<p>The CMF Phone 2 Pro runs Nothing OS 3.2 based on Android 15 out of the box, and the brand continues to do a stellar job with its UI. You get a clean interface with a distinct visual styling, and it makes using the device that much more enjoyable. Nothing's exclusive widgets are a big part of why I like using its phones, and the design combined with usability makes the OS as a whole stand out.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3NNw2L7KGNEHfDSXgupMCW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get a good amount of customizability as well, and the interface is fluid — I didn't have issues in daily use. You get the usual AI-enabled utilities with on-device transcribing, and Nothing uses ChatGPT for any cloud-facing requests. On that note, a new addition is Essential Space, which basically makes it easy to organize information, including creating notes, taking memos, and saving things like billers.</p>

<p>The utility does a great job, and it's another way that Nothing differentiates its devices. Switching over to updates, the CMF Phone 2 Pro will get three Android OS updates and six years of security updates, and that's among the best of any budget phone today.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro-the-alternatives"><span>Nothing CMF Phone 2 Pro: The alternatives</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dTFgzp9iUDD3sYwQFGgNEW" name="CMF Phone 2 Pro" alt="CMF Phone 2 Pro review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTFgzp9iUDD3sYwQFGgNEW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO's X7 continues to be a good choice if you need a reliable budget phone. It has the same MediaTek Dimensity 7300 platform, a bigger 5500mAh battery with 45W charging, and IP68 ingress protection. The software isn't as good as the CMF phone 2 Pro, and it won't get as many updates, but if battery life is a priority, the X7 is a good option. <br><br>Last year's CMF Phone 1 is still quite decent, and a viable alternative if you can get a good deal on the device. Obviously, you miss out on the upgrades that the CMF Phone 2 Pro offers, but the Phone 1 is a great device in its own right.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-nothing-cmf-phone-2-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Nothing CMF Phone 2 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone that looks great</li><li>You want good cameras</li><li>You need clean software on a budget device</li><li>You want timely software updates</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a gaming phone</li></ul>
<p>Nothing is making a habit of showing up other budget phones, and the CMF Phone 2 Pro is my go-to recommendation if you need a new sub-$300 phone in 2025. There's a lot to like with the design, and the unique accessories give the device an edge. The AMOLED panel has good colors, and the thin bezels make the device feel premium. <br><br>You get a good set of cameras at the back, great battery life, and the software is easily the best you'll find on any budget phone. The only limitation is around gaming; you'll want to get the Phone 3a Pro if you need a bit of added power, but other than that, the CMF Phone 2 Pro is a fantastic all-rounder.</p>

<p>After debuting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/boox-palma-2-note-air4-c-launch-details">Palma 2 and Note Air4 C</a> last year, Boox is back with a new set of portable readers — the new Go 7 series.</p><p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/collections/all/products/go7">ereaders were launched</a> late last week and include the Go 7 and Go Color 7 (Gen II). These new Android-based eReaders come with writing capabilities for immersive reading. They also claim to be ideal sidekicks for commuters and for those who prefer to read in outdoor environments.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="46LGrkJKLt64UKWSyRu5Pk" name="Boox-Go-7" alt="Boox Go 7" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/46LGrkJKLt64UKWSyRu5Pk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Boox)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both eReaders carry the same screen sizes, which are 7 inches; however, the Go Color 7 equips a Kaleido 3 display — the same as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/kobo-libra-colour-review">Kobo Libra Colour</a> — promising a true-to-life color panel. It also promises to offer visually rich content. On the other hand, the regular Go 7 comes with a Carta 1300 monochrome display and has a resolution of 300ppi, with a sharp text clarity that is believed to mimic traditional paper. Additionally, both also feature adjustable front lights for comfortable reading in all lighting conditions.</p><p>Further, both models support handwriting capabilities with the help of Boox’s InkSense stylus — to quickly jot down thoughts, highlight text, and mark up in the books users read. They are also provided with a dedicated Notes app to write things when required.</p>

<p>Underneath, the latest Boox ereaders run Android 13 and have access to the Google Play Store to install your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-apps">favorite Android apps</a>. Both models are equipped with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of inbuilt storage, which can further be expanded with the help of a microSD card.</p><p>Lastly, these ereaders weigh around 195 grams each and offer a compact and lightweight form factor that further helps in easy one-handed use, which is essential for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-e-ink-tablet">any e-ink device</a>. In addition, they have wide bezels to hold on to, an ergonomic page turn button, and a textured back for additional grip. And for protection against spills and light rain, they feature a water-repellent design.</p><p>The Boox Go 7 and Go Color 7 both come in two color options — black and white — with the latter getting a navy blue finish. The Go 7 is available for preorder in U.S. and European markets with $249.99/£219.99/€249.99 pricing. The Go Color 7 is not yet on sale, but it will be priced at $279.99/£249.99/€279.99 for the aforementioned regions.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new leak has surfaced, claiming that Samsung's second iteration of its rugged smartwatch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2, is set to launch this summer. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/galaxy-watch-ultra-2-could-debut-at-galaxy-z-fold-7-event-and-with-no-price-increase">Tech Radar</a>, this new leak originates from a Greek news website, which states that the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 will launch alongside Samsung's foldable lineup — the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and the Z Fold 7.</p><p>If this rumor is accurate, the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 could potentially be unveiled in July. Earlier speculation suggests that the Samsung Galaxy Unpacked event is scheduled for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">early July in New York.</a></p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techmaniacs.gr/apokleistiko-ayta-einai-ta-galaxy-z-fold-7-kai-z-flip-7-epiteloys-pragmatika-lepta/" target="_blank">Techmaniacs</a>, the above-mentioned website stated that "We just learned that, along with the phones, a new Galaxy Watch Ultra will also be coming."</p>

<p>The lack of leaks about the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 leaves us with little to no information about the specs or the design. However, the publication added that the wearable "will feature a similar design to the current watch, but with more storage space, and a new user interface more reminiscent of One UI 7."</p><p>This could mean that the smartwatch could have the same squircle design as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, but with enhanced storage and possibly a more intuitive interface. We're hoping that the new Watch Ultra will feature a renewed design, possibly with a physical bezel, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank">Watch 6 Classic, </a>or<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review" target="_blank"> </a>a rotating crown, like many other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch" target="_blank">Android watches</a> on the market.</p><p>As for the cost of this high-end rugged watch, Techmaniacs claims the price will remain the same as its predecessor, which is approximately $649.99. Although this is still a leak, it remains uncertain whether the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 will be released in July with the aforementioned specs.  That said, here's Android Central's comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2" target="_blank">wishlist</a> of everything we expect to see in a future Galaxy Watch Ultra 2 model.</p>

<ul><li>Google One device backups currently include text message data, but not SIM information.</li><li>In a future update, Google could add the ability to save SIM data, likely for eSIMs.</li><li>This addition could simplify the process of backing up and restoring Android phones.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google could be developing a way to include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/esim-simplified-my-life-but-not-in-the-way-i-expected">eSIM data</a> as part of the device backup process for Android phones, according to code strings found by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-sim-backup-apk-teardown-3548643/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. The code, discovered in an APK teardown of the Google Play Services app beta version 25.16.33, lists "SIMs" as a backup data type for the first time. However, it is not functional and isn't guaranteed to arrive in a future update.</p><p>The code strings in the Google Play Services app beta aren't the only things indicating Google is working on eSIM backups. In a refreshed version of Android's device backup settings page, a description of "other device data" now includes "contacts, call history, device settings, apps and app data, SMS and MMS messages, and SIMs to your Google Account."</p><p>While not explicitly stated, it can be assumed that this feature would handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIMs</a>, as physical SIM cards can be easily transferred between devices. However, both Apple and Samsung offer software tools that can convert a physical SIM to an on-device eSIM, so it's possible Google's work-in-progress feature handles physical SIM cards as well.</p><p>Here's the exact code string that points to future SIM backups:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><code>&lt;string name="backup_settings_devicedata_data_type_sims"&gt;SIMs&lt;/string&gt;</code></code></pre>
<p>Of course, it's worth noting that SIMs can't be backed up at the moment. If this functionality was added in a future update, it would make the process of restoring backups on Android easier than on iPhone.</p>

<p>The feature would be added to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-back-your-android-phone-and-data-google-one">Google One device backup</a>, and would require a paid <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One subscription plan</a> for use.

<hr>
<p>Google is reportedly working on a more convenient (and quicker) method for users looking to add digital cards to their phones.</p><p>After tearing through a recent Play Services beta, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-wallet-add-cards-nfc-apk-teardown-3548577/">Android Authority</a> discovered what looks to be a "tap-to-add" feature for Google Wallet. Evidence in the code was light; however, Google's additions mention the feature by name, as well as stating, "Hold your card to the back of your device until it vibrates."</p><p>Another string states users would need to "tap card to phone" to progress with the supposed card-adding method.</p><p>At the core of this feature is what your phone would leverage, which, in this case, is NFC. The early code lacks more robust bits of information, but the publication has speculated what the meat of the feature could look like. It suggests the NFC scanning could leverage your card's number and expiration date, leaving the (arguably) most crucial aspect to you: its CVV.</p><p>Moreover, there are assumptions that Google Wallet's feature could feature a few limitations, like only accepting cards that are "EMV-compliant." The post states this involves card companies like Visa and Mastercard. Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-wallet-tap-to-add-card/">Android Police</a> presumes this feature (if it rolls out) could see limited availability like Apple's version via Apple Wallet.</p>

This would enable the possibility of multiple transactions "to be seamlessly conducted over the course of one single tap," per the executive director of the NFC Forum, Mike McCamon.</p><p>A likely scenario is Multi-Purpose Tap could let users verify their age via their digital ID, pay with their preferred card, and receive a digital receipt all in one go.</p><p>In recent history, Google's been busy upgrading the range of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">supported digital IDs</a> in the U.S. There's been some resistance in bringing this functionality to all states, considering every place has its own rules and regulations regarding digital IDs. However, Google's worked to add Arizona, Colorado, Georgia, and Maryland. California already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/california-preapres-google-wallet-id-support">started down its path</a> to incorporate digital IDs last August.</p><p>Google Wallet's latest update brought <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay/google-wallet-train-status-alerts-update-io-teaser">real-time train status updates</a> to users. After adding a train ticket, Wallet will deliver "On Time," "Delayed," and other status updates about your ride. The feature is limited to two regions at the moment, so the bulk of us will have to wait.</p>

<p>Looks like something exciting is brewing at Google. The company just dropped a teaser for a new episode of The Android Show.</p><p>For the first time, the show will feature an exclusive I/O edition, which is said to provide Android enthusiasts around the globe with a "lowdown on the latest Android innovations and experiences in the run up to Google I/O," the show announced, teasing this episode on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/new-features-on-android/io-2025/">official website</a>.</p><p>The episode will air on May 13 at 1 p.m. and will be hosted by Sameer Samat, president of the Android Ecosystem, as well as other Android team members who will discuss new features set to debut with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> and other Android-related developments in the works.</p><p>“What's new with Android has always been a huge part of Google I/O, and we know people are excited! That's why we're kicking off this year's I/O season with a special deep dive," Samat added.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/events/show">The Android Show</a> is a video series produced by the Android Developers team at Google. The show typically launches a new episode every quarter that discusses all things Android, including news, features, and updates.</p><p>This I/O episode is unique since Google usually keeps all the new Android developments under wraps until it announces everything at I/O. For it to announce innovations ahead of the main event, it could only mean that they have a lot to discuss on the Android front and are splitting it into two parts, or that I/O will be heavily focused on AI.</p><p>Further explaining what folks could expect from this episode, Samat said, "We'll be sharing news now to get you ready for I/O, where we'll have even more special announcements and surprises in store.”</p><p>During the MWC this year, Samat <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">hinted</a> at showing off some of Android 16's new features ahead of launch, which we thought would happen at this year's I/O. However, a glimpse at the new OS seems to be coming a week early, and we're not complaining.</p><p>Google added that this show will be pre-recorded and streamed on YouTube Live at the above-mentioned time. Those interested can hit the "notify me" button within the teaser (below), so that they don't miss out on the fun.</p>

<p>That said, last week, Google put out a comprehensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-i-o-2025-prepares-sessions-list-android-xr-ai">lineup</a> of scheduled events and workshops set to take place at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O</a> this year. Users will be given a glimpse into Android's new UX design, Material 3 Expressive, as well as Gemini in Chrome and Android XR.</p>
