Furthermore, it helps clean up that mess of wires on your desk.</p><p>While you’ve got options like wireless pads or multi-port chargers, they can be bulky and eat up space, which isn’t exactly ideal when you’re trying to travel light.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication states that Samsung officially registered a new device under the name "Galaxy Z Trifold" earlier this week in South Korea.</p><p>Earlier leaks have suggested that this device could be called the G Fold, based on the way the hinges would work, allowing the device to close inward. However, it might not be the case.</p><p>It seems like the company has applied for a trademark certification on the name, which could mean that the company might stick to the same name at least in its domestic market. "After all, the first version will only be released in South Korea, and perhaps China – but not in Europe or the US," <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-z-trifold/">Galaxy Club added.</a></p><p>Whether or not Samsung keeps the name, this trademark registration reveals that the device might show up in the Galaxy Z lineup, and the word "trifold" indicates the presence of two hinges, as seen in previous rumors about the phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-21" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 200MP camera mode hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxCv6aksvWb5CjoTo88kv3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website also adds that the trifold has been given a model number SM-F968N and the internal codename Q7M. And the phone is steadily moving towards a year-end launch. This was backed by another recent mention of the trifold, right from the source itself.</p><p>Samsung's acting head of the device experience division, TM Roh, said during a press interview with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/business/tech-science/20250710/samsung-seeks-to-roll-out-tri-fold-phone-by-year-end-head-of-smartphone-business-says" target="_blank">The Korea Times</a> that the company "(is expected to) launch the tri-fold phone within this year." Roh spoke about those Galaxy trifold rumors, adding that Samsung has not finalized a name for the tri-fold just yet. Unfortunately, Roh's press interview didn't give us any other specifications or features about the tri-fold.</p><p>So far, rumors have indicated that this phone will allegedly fold inward, feature a massive 10-inch display when unfolded, and a slightly thicker build when compared to Huawei's tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Mate XT</a>. The external display could measure about 6.49 inches, but might not support the S-Pen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sheds-the-s-pen-on-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-for-super-slim-design">just like the latest Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-snapshot" alt="Samsung's expected tri-fold's rear panels, as leaked in a One UI 8 animation, showing a triple rear camera array and its cover display." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EEewB9eJ9NoHjX5FBrgcL7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="896" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:816px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.53%;"><img id="LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7" name="samsung-galaxy-g-fold-one-ui-8-animation-front-display-leak" alt="A leaked snapshot of Samsung's tri-fold's internal display from a One UI 8 animation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuYcV9XuGoPUSKq2PTxBM7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="816" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Apart from those hardware aspects, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-hints-at-samsung-tri-fold-phone-in-animations-leak" target="_blank">recent leak</a> showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-install-one-ui-beta" target="_blank">One UI 8 </a>animations on the alleged trifold device, including its functions. One animation demonstrates the trifold's folding process, where the left-most portion opens, revealing its full display.</p><p>The animation shows that two hinges fold inward, but the left and right panels are of different sizes. The former is much smaller, meaning that it needs to be folded first. This is backed up by One UI 8's warning animation that says users should not fold the panel with the camera array first when closing.</p><p>That said, TECNO <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-concept-fully-revealed-showcase">may have beaten Samsung to the punch</a> and unveiled its Phantom Ultimate G Fold concept today (July 17). The phone sports a "G-style" inward folding design with two hinges, with a thickness that is "comparable" to a regular book-style phone (think Z Fold 7), but its open state measures 3.49mm thin.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Our own Nicholas Sutrich has spotted the new layout on his OnePlus 13.</p><p>This change popped up after a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-app-favorites-tab-3566618/" target="_blank">leak</a> last month. While some might see the revamped UI as a step forward, it looks like Google quietly dropped a key feature along the way.</p><p>Previously, the Phone app had a bottom tab that gave you instant access to your top contacts. Just one tap, and your pinned favorites were all right there.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4NF4Gpo8JuknAskETu5Sm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diyeRk3jMNsB5K5eFDacLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rkvCXxc9gFaSZsb2zQzXLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6hZD8ji9oX2WoWq8VffSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:220.00%;"><img id="V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm" name="Google-Phone-app" alt="new UI for the Google Phone app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V4w8VRhMSbo7MmfdYLgSLm.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Last month’s leak displayed an “Add” button at the end of the favorites row, likely meant for quickly adding more contacts.

The best internet plan, called All-In, is also the most expensive, starting at $70 with AutoPay or $55 when you bundle with voice.</p><p>All taxes and fees are included in the price, and again, there are no monthly equipment fees or no pesky annual contracts to worry about when you get your bill. If you&apos;re not totally sold on T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet, you can also test drive the service for 15 days and get all of your money back if you&apos;re not feeling it. T-Mo will even pay for the shipping. Needless to say, there are plenty of good reasons to consider T-Mobile&apos;s 5G Home Internet if it&apos;s available in your area.

We're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">expecting a handful of announcements</a>, including the Google Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 XL, and Pixel 10 Fold. Phew.</p><p>However, while new hardware is always exciting to see unveiled, is it actually worth waiting for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Google Pixel 10</a>, or should you opt for a discounted Pixel 9 instead? The answer to this question varies greatly depending on which model you're looking to pick up, so let's take a look at what we're expecting Google to unveil and how it compares to the Pixel 9 family.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf" name="Made-by-google-2024-poster" alt="Google 2024 poster" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhgbdKvBinXscM3et53NUf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're excited about Google's smallest, most affordable phone in the Pixel 10 lineup, I recommend waiting for the Pixel 10. Of all the models, the base Pixel 10 looks to be getting the most changes compared to the currently available Pixel 9. Here's a quick breakdown based on rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>A telephoto camera (5x optical zoom <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-alleged-prototype-surfaces-chinese-auction-site-spotted">according to leaks</a>)</li><li>New sensors for the main and ultrawide cameras</li><li>Larger batteries</li></ul><p>We don't expect any physical design changes from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9 to the Pixel 10</a> other than the addition of that third camera on the back. This new camera would mark the first time Google has put a telephoto camera on a base Pixel model. One of the biggest reasons to choose the Pro model in the past was for the telephoto camera, so this makes the decision to get the base Pixel 10 much easier than in the past.</p><p>It's rumored that Google will be using smaller main and ultrawide camera sensors to fit this new telephoto camera in. While that sounds like a downgrade at first, we had this same concern with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> — which featured smaller sensors than the Pixel 8a — but it turned out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-camera-review">that the camera was just fine</a>. In other words, the Pixel 10 should be a camera upgrade on all counts.</p><p>Additionally, the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal" target="_blank">Tensor G5 processor</a>, which is expected to debut in the Pixel 10, is reportedly around 25% faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> in the Pixel 9. That's a big deal because Tensor speeds have been generally stagnant for years, and the latest leaked benchmarks are showing that the G5 is comparable to last year's best Snapdragon processor — a huge improvement over the Pixel 9.</p><p>Lastly, Google is reportedly increasing the battery capacity by a small amount. The Pixel 10 is rumored to ship with a 4,970mAh battery, while the Pixel 9 had a 4,700mAh battery. That might not make a huge difference in daily usage, but it could help get you through the end of the day without having to top up.</p><h2 id="should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-or-xl-2">Should you wait for the Google Pixel 10 Pro or XL?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wHbb3wfTxJGGpk9rwKdb5b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Fold leaks have shown some interesting changes, the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">look less exciting</a>. If I had to buy a phone today and I was buying a Pixel, I'd just get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and be done with it. Here's what we expect to see when Google announces these phones in mid-August, per rumors:</p><ul><li>Faster processor (~25% per rumors)</li><li>Larger batteries</li><li>Faster PWM rate</li></ul><p>That's not a lot of changes year-over-year, and it makes for a less exciting August for Pro model fans. But that doesn't mean there won't be <em>any</em> upgrades, as the Tensor G5 upgrade could be worth it alone if you're into mobile gaming. A slight increase in battery sizes of about 150mAh for each model also means just a tad more juice to get through your day. Charging speeds are likely the same between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 10.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">Geekbench leak</a> for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold reveals that the Tensor G5 is performing at speeds comparable to those of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, marking a significant improvement. Comparatively, the Tensor G4 performed roughly equivalent to a Galaxy S22 Ultra on a good day. That still means that Tensor doesn't match phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> in terms of speed, but it might be enough to make up the difference for mobile gamers.</p><p>Folks who are sensitive to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> have been unable to use Pixel phones for a long time, but the Pixel 10 Pro line could change that with an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-display-leak-pwm-dimming-rate" target="_blank">improved PWM rate</a> and a rumored accessibility feature for those with extra sensitivity. As someone who is PWM sensitive, this is music to my ears, meaning I could enjoy using a Pixel full-time again without getting a headache.</p><h2 id="how-about-the-cost-2">How about the cost?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-with-box-2025-01" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wxQnJGSpMcP8n4fwqZfq3b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've seen rumors that the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro will retain the same MSRP as the equivalent Pixel 9 models, but the Pixel 10 Pro XL is apparently getting a $100 price increase. During Prime Day, we saw the Pixel 9 Pro go for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-prime-day-deal-2025">as low as $734</a>, and it's clear that stores like Amazon and Best Buy are looking to get rid of their stock before the Pixel 10 needs to be on shelves.</p><p>If you're in the market for a base Pixel 10, I say wait. The changes look to be big enough to justify your patience, even if you'll end up spending more than if you picked up a discounted Pixel 9 right now. Folks interested in a Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL are safe to grab a cheap Pixel 9 Pro/XL right now unless they fall into either of these two categories: gamers, and PWM sensitive people.</p><p>Gamers should wait for the Pixel 10 as the extra performance from Tensor G5 will likely make mobile games on a Pixel worth playing. PWM-sensitive people should wait to see what Google has in store for the Pixel 10 Pro series, as we've been told Google is working on something specifically for this subset of users.</p><p>If the Pixel 10 Pro XL ends up receiving the rumored $100 price bump, there's almost no reason to recommend buying that model over a discounted Pixel 9 Pro XL. Based on current trends, that means the Pixel 10 Pro XL would end up being roughly $400 more than the Pixel 9 Pro XL when it's on sale, and no upgrade is worth that kind of cost.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster boldly states Samsung's recent Fold 7 "is the thinnest folding mobile phone in the world." According to their test, which showcased both foldables side by side on a table, the Fold 7 appeared ever-so-slightly thinner than the Magic V5.</p><p>To illustrate this, Ice Universe placed objects (cards) across the tops of both devices. When set down, the card just barely teetered downward toward the Fold 7. Subtle tests with items showed that the Fold 7 appears to have a minuscule edge over the Magic V5 in thinness.</p><p>Ice Universe ran the devices through a quick caliper test, which shed more light. In their test, the Magic V5 resulted in an 8.95mm measurement, while the Fold 7 saw 8.79mm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:448px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.93%;"><img id="d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-caliper-thin-measurement" alt="Honor's image of a caliper's 8.8mm measurement for the Magic V5 foldable, delivered to a publication after reports claim it is not the thinnest." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d7ySGTBL25VgSHobH5YUiA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="448" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the tipster's "rigorous" testing, the publication received a statement from Honor about the matter.

Since style is subjective, I'll focus on the more quantifiable second perk: Is the rotating bezel worth it, and will you like how Samsung changed it?</p><p>Both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-review">Watch 4 Classic</a> had rotating bezels around their displays, hearkening back to the original Tizen OS Galaxy Watch design. Physical controls define the "Classic" experience as much as the retro chic; it's why so many Samsung watch fans skip alternating years to avoid the mainline models' digital bezel.</p><p>I'm thrilled to have swapped back to a Classic design after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> for a year, even if it meant losing battery life for exact controls. But there's one change to the bezel that's more about looks than utility, to which Classic veterans will have to adjust.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-bezel-is-different-from-its-predecessors-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 bezel is different from its predecessors</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:772px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-original" alt="A photo of the Samsung Galaxy Watch (2018) held in someone's hand, showing a Classic-style bezel and watch face." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W55LopxCgD7TF5Y6u4oDvX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="772" height="434" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The original Samsung Galaxy Watch design </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Martonik / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT" name="best-samsung-watch-bands-hero.jpeg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 worn on someone's left wrist, showing an analogue watch face and steel rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiYZEZj5ZbvfudbQ5tR7AT.jpeg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3, still running Tizen OS </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-4-Classic-fitness-wide.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic fitness" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v5QX8MJxuvzmhF4wA99R3b.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2046" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Daniel Bader / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-6-Classic-rotating-bezel-workouts.jpg" alt="Selecting a workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khezkUUeGhoiWqmULtAGF5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">The rotating bezel on the Galaxy Watch 6 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Look at the Galaxy Watch, Watch 3, Watch 4 Classic, and Watch 6 Classic in the slideshow above. Samsung gave each rotating bezel tiny ridges that add grip but don't feel too rough against your fingertips. On my Watch 6 Classic, I appreciated how only the bottom half of the bezel is ridged, so it feels completely smooth to turn when I grip from the top.</p><p>Designed with function in mind, these bezels are subtle compared to luxury watches' rotating bezels; those are designed for diving, with thick, striking ridges that aren't as comfortable to turn but make a statement.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic lacks the 60-second markings along the border that were present on the Watch 1, 3, and 4 Classic. Samsung attempted to emulate this look with "classic" watch faces, but from the wearer's perspective with the display dimmed, the last Classic appeared somewhat bare-bones, similar to other smartwatches.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-display" alt="A close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the default watch face, display border, and rotating bezel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmCkQeqkBb8gdoDpyGNGsZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2766" height="1556" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now look at the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel. Its ridges are deeper and extend to the top, so you get plenty of texture against your fingers every time you turn it. And Samsung brought back the 60-second scale around the display, which gives the Classic a bit of <em>class</em>.</p><p>The problem, of course, is that Samsung sacrificed comfort for style. I wouldn't necessarily call the Watch 8 Classic bezel <em>un</em>comfortable, but it does press into your fingers as you grip it. I turn it more deliberately than my Watch 6 Classic bezel.</p><p>But since people are paying for a distinct look as much as improved controls — and since the bezel balances out the thick, Ultra-esque look of the Watch 8 series — I think the new bezel was the right choice. And since Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">improved the Watch 8 Tiles</a> to fit more information per Tile, I don't usually need to turn the bezel that much to find what I need.</p><h2 id="why-the-galaxy-watch-8-classic-bezel-is-or-isn-t-worth-it-2">Why the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic bezel is (or isn't) worth it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-11" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 and Watch 8 Classic hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSwRvnjnfP2PpmQKhDizXG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Watch 8 (<em>left</em>) and Watch 8 Classic (<em>right</em>) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The old Classics cost $100 more than the base models, offering more flair but no new features. Samsung made the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic $150 more, whether because of tariffs or inflation. You get double the storage and the third Quick Button in exchange, but these alone aren't worth the upgrade if you don't like the Classic's whole raison d'être.</p><p>Is the physical bezel worth paying extra for? It lets you turn to the exact Tile, notification, or menu you want, with <em>clicks</em> marking each turn that I find satisfying, but others might find annoying.</p><p>Galaxy Watches' default digital bezel makes it way too easy to scroll past things, but it's also faster once you master it, and you may prefer a quick single-finger scroll to the two-finger grip the Classic demands. I don't, but you might!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-close-up-on-bezel" alt="Close-up of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's rotating bezel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QojuSoMeMS9vQvpu2wAaA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I appreciate how I can check notifications or Tiles with a single scroll, my wrist still sitting on my desk as I type. This might sound small, but not having to tap the display or lift it to my eyes to check something is highly convenient.</p><p>If you regularly work out, you'll appreciate the option to scroll through data fields via bezel instead of relying on sweaty finger swipes. But some will accept less exact controls for a lighter Watch 8 fit.</p><p>Overall, I much prefer using the Watch 8 Classic to its standard and Ultra siblings for everyday use, and I also think the bezel adds a distinctive look that the other two lack. But this new design only fits a 1.34-inch display, so if you're accustomed to a 1.5-inch display, you'll have to skip the bezel.</p><p>If I were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/should-you-upgrade-to-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-or-watch-8-classic">upgrading to the Watch 8 series</a>, the Classic would be my first choice, especially with a Watch 6 Classic trade-in.

Maybe we should look at 2026 for this supposed battery capacity boost. The publication speculates we could see this rumored power boost sometime this year, so we'll have to see what happens.</p><h2 id="staying-off-the-charger-for-longer-2">Staying off the charger for longer</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1660px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR" name="honor-magic-v5-foldable-launch-hero" alt="The Honor Magic V5 in Dawn Gold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fa4Wfi2S6B5R5vcYYcNQrR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1660" height="926" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor consumers would likely enjoy these rumored battery increases, especially when you look back at the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">previous Pro flagship phones</a>. The Honor Magic 7 Pro, which saw a global debut earlier this year in January, debuted with a 5,270mAh battery. While this is smaller than the Chinese variant (5,850mAh), the Magic 7 Pro still rocks the brand's third-gen silicon tech. The phone can last an entire day, even through some heavy use, so it wasn't too bad of a compromise.</p><p>The Magic 7 Pro's silicon battery tech from Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honors-silicon-battery-tech-makes-the-magic-7-pro-stand-out-even-more">already made the phone stand out</a> around the time of its launch. According to our very own Harish Jonnalagadda, this technology means Honor's batteries will have "higher density." In short, "brands can leverage this tech to add bigger batteries without increasing the size or weight of their phones, and that's always a good thing."</p><p>On the other hand, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-6-pro-review#section-honor-magic-6-pro-battery-life">the Magic 6 Pro</a> and its 5,600mAh battery. Heavy to medium use saw similar durations with the 7 Pro. If the tipster is believed, bumping future flagships to 7,000mAh or higher would do wonders for the devices, as users can likely go even further on a single full charge.</p><p>One outlier <em>might </em>be its foldable, specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">the Magic V5</a> and future iterations of it. Honor really honed in on shaving it down to make it thinner. Considering Honor's battery tech use, perhaps it can implement larger batteries while keeping its future Magic V foldables incredibly thin.</p><p>The Magic V5 sports a 6,100mAh battery based on Honor's "razor-thin" silicon-carbon battery technology.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, when fully opened, TECNO states its G Fold's "ultra-slim" profile measures out to 3.49mm.</p><p>TECNO credits its development process for fine-tuning the phone's display, materials, and hinges to achieve such a thin measurement, despite its form factor.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-snake-g-fold" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept features an inward folding "G" mechanic, that looks like a snake." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xCHthmoDqaEGdSDnBBXQ3G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-open-thin" alt="The TECNO Phantom Ultimate G Fold fully open, showing off its incredibly thin profile." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FweZ8rfypBxfeXGu8ALL4G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-closed-cover-display" alt="TECNO's G Fold concept fully closed, showing off its cover display that feels close to a regular smartphone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZheqrcRs52ygUQnU2vJ5G.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold's hinge is a shining highlight for TECNO. The post states the device's concept receives an "innovative G-style design" for its hinges. The G Fold offers two hinges, one for each inward folding display. These hinges aren't created equally, as TECNO states the right side boasts a smaller waterdrop hinge, while the left side is a "larger primary" hinge.</p><p>The right side folds in first and then the left. TECNO states both inward folding displays offer a "gapless and secure" experience, to ensure the screens—especially the center—remain safe.</p><p>When fully unfolded, TECNO says the G Fold delivers a 9.94-inch display "with minimal creasing." Additionally, the company highlights the G Fold's multi-angle hovering, thanks to its "dual-cam" design. The post teases that the concept allows for users to utilize the phone in a partially folded state to get quick bouts of work done before moving on.</p><p>The Phantom Ultimate G Fold is still a concept, but TECNO teases its specifications, which claim to not compromise on the flagship experience. The G Fold is expected to be powered by a high-performance chip with a triple camera array and a battery that's over 5,000mAh.</p><p>TECNO is expected to fully showcase the Phantom Ultimate G Fold during MWC 2026.</p><h2 id="concept-revealed-2">Concept Revealed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL" name="tecno-phantom-g-fold-full-concept-rear-panels" alt="The TECNO G Fold concept from behind, showing off its three panels and triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uDeTbeq5aaTuNwtk25zAPL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: TECNO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>TECNO has been gearing up for a complete reveal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phones/tecno-new-phantom-ultimate-g-fold-tri-fold-concept-tease">of its G Fold concept</a> for a while now.

Think about the sensory aspect of a watch band, in addition to regular things like the price and style of the band. While the collection of Watch 8 compatible straps isn't as diverse as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/best-samsung-galaxy-watch-7-bands">Watch 7's quick-release bands</a>, what's on the market is more than sufficient.</p><p>Before shopping for Watch 8 bands, identify the sort of material you'd like to add to your collection. I like to have at least one fabric, one metal, and one rubber or silicone option with my primary wearable. This is a good framework to o by if you wear your smartwatch every day, wherever you go.</p><p>Since the Watch 8 already comes with a Classic Sport Band, you may or may not be interested in getting one. However, it's always a good idea to have a spare secondary color that you can switch to. This soft rubber band is gentle on the skin, easily adjustable, and durable, which is why it's the best overall pick when seeking out Watch 8 bands.</p><p>Next, consider spicing up your Samsung Galaxy Watch 8's wardrobe with a different texture. A metal band is a must-have. The Miimall Metal Band for the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is astonishingly affordable, plus it comes in black and silver to match the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">colorways of the Watch 8</a>. Since it's made of stainless steel, it is not susceptible to rust. You get a screwdriver in the box, allowing you to open up links to manually adjust the size of the metal band at home. It's a fantastic budget buy.</p><p>Lastly, consider a fabric option like the durable Spigen Athlex Air or the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band. I use my Spigen woven band every day when working out, going to work, or just taking a leisurely stroll outdoors. While the one I use with my Pixel Watch isn't available for the Galaxy Watch 8, I am confident the Spigen Athlex Air will be just as rugged and comfortable. If you want something softer and elastic, the Hexasider Stretchy Nylon Band is also a great choice. And, it comes in a wide range of fun colors to boot.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This is something Pixel fans have been asking for for years, and it's nice to see Google delivering on that front. The Pixel 9 Pro was a mature leap forward in design, and it had some of the best AI features to come in an Android phone.</p><p>However, it wasn't without its flaws. The display still had a draconian PWM dimming rate; the processor simply wasn't suited for competitive gaming, and the measly 128GB base storage was a low blow for a phone that was more expensive than its predecessor.</p><p>All those who skipped the 2024 model in the hopes of getting the Pixel 10 Pro this year are probably not going to be too happy. The Pixel 10 series is expected sometime in August, and going by the leaks so far, it doesn't appear to be drastically different from the 9 Pro. This begs the question when comparing the Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro — is it really worth waiting for?</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9" name="Pixel-10-pro-prototype" alt="Pixel 10 Pro leaks in all angles" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JUWqYvwqm6NB7ycFJnFzV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mystic Leaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Our best look at the Pixel 10 Pro comes from this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-pixel-10-pro-and-xl-cameras-may-see-no-upgrades-leak-reveals">alleged hands-on photo</a> posted by Mystic Leaks. The phone looks virtually identical to the 9 Pro except for the rear camera bar, which looks visibly larger. This increase in size has seemingly been further confirmed thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Thinborne's new cases for the Pixel 10 series</a>, which are apparently already sold out.</p><p>It's unsurprising that Google hasn't made any drastic changes to the design, as it underwent a major overhaul just last year. I'm sure we'll see a few nips and tucks in the construction and layout of things, but the Pixel 10 Pro should largely look and feel the same. We would love a lower weight, though, as the 9 Pro is not exactly light at nearly 200g.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> is already built extremely well, so there wasn't much to change in the first place. The front and back have Gorilla Glass Victus 2 for scratch resistance, and there's an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance. The protruding rear camera island didn't win over everyone, and it remains on the 10 Pro as well. The Pixel 10 Pro should have the exact same weather resistance and rugged construction.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E" name="google-pixel-9-pro-in-hand-screen.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jZKFCDntMzraETuRSpvG8E.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 Pro features a 6.3-inch OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, and a high pixel count of about 495 ppi. The one thing that we didn't like about it was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">awful 240Hz PWM dimming rate</a>, which can cause severe headaches if you're eyes are sensitive to flicker. Pretty much everyone in the industry has moved to a higher PWM rate or has switched to DC dimming entirely, but not Google.</p><p>There's no evidence to suggest that the Pixel 10 Pro's display is going to be much different. This means we're looking at the same size, resolution, and brightness specs in all likelihood. There's a ray of hope, though, that Google might have fixed the PWM dimming issue in the 10 Pro. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/potential-display-dimming-update-for-google-pixel-devices">Google exclusively told Android Central</a> this April that its teams "are aware and investigating this" and that "you can expect updates later this year." This last piece of the puzzle could put the Pixel 10 Pro's display among the best, alongside the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-4.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL back view against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5KEfivy8DJxt7Qw5SeUodQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's no word on the pricing for the Pixel 10 Pro, but we expect the price of the smaller Pro to remain the same, considering Google raised it just last year. This means it should be $999 for the 10 Pro's 128GB, and there'll be two more storage tiers after this. The 10 Pro XL should be $100 more across variants, according to rumors. A recent leak suggests that Google might rejig the storage tiers of the XL model and start with 256GB. Honestly, I hope it does that for the standard Pro too, as 128GB is way too low these days, especially for a "Pro" phone.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro is still sold at the above prices at most places, unless you purchase it during a sale or through your carrier. Once the Pixel 10 Pro hits shelves, though, the 9 Pro's price will come down. Whether it makes a good deal or not totally depends on the discount, but if it's not more than $100, you might as well spring for the 10 Pro.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro (speculative)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p><p></p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p><p>Seven years of OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch 120Hz Actua OLED, 1280 x 2856, HDR, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,000 nits peak</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G4</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/ 256GB/ 512GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 48MP telephoto + 48MP ultrawide</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td><td  ><p>42MP</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Global 5G, Satellite SOS (U.S.), Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>4,870mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,700mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.6mm</p></td><td  ><p>152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Unkown</p></td><td  ><p>Porcelain, Rose Quartz, Hazel, Obsidian</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Pixel 10 Pro is expected to feature the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> SoC, which is rumored to be a significant development as it may be the first SoC designed in-house by Google. Past Tensor chips have used Samsung's Exynos designs, which is why they have never been able to really compete with Qualcomm's offerings. All that should change with the Pixel 10 Pro.</p><p>We should also expect a slight boost in battery capacity to 4,870mAh and a quicker wired charging speed of 29W. It's not much compared to what the competition offers, but it's a step in the right direction for Pixels. The cameras, on the other hand, are expected to remain largely unchanged. We'll likely have new features, but don't expect any significant changes to the sensors.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro doesn't perform well in heavy gaming, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> chip throttles quite noticeably. It's more efficient than the G3, but not a lot more powerful as far as raw performance goes. The cameras on the Pixel 9 Pro are fantastic and can deliver superb details and colors in pretty much all lighting conditions.</p><p>The haptics were something that really stood out, too, when we reviewed it. Battery life is also greatly improved over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> thanks to the more power-efficient SoC and optimized software.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-vs-pixel-9-pro-software-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro vs. Pixel 9 Pro: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jrG4Az3RqBSHzPm9Kex9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro will most definitely ship with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> as Google has already rolled out the stable release for the Pixel 9 series. Along with this, you can expect seven years of software updates, which would include OS upgrades and security patches. The Pixel 10 Pro could potentially get two more Android versions than the Pixel 9 Pro since the latter launched with Android 14 instead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> or 16.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 Pro, we saw it get exclusive AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">Add Me</a> and Video Boost, and we're sure there are some exclusive features in the works for the Pixel 10 Pro that won't make it to the 9 Pro. These exclusive features are usually bound by the hardware in the phone, which is why they don't make it to previous generation models.

Considering it's rumored to come in at the same price as the Pixel 9 Pro and with pre-order bonuses, the Pixel 10 Pro would be worth getting over the 9 Pro at the same price. Even if only a few of the rumors pan out like the improved performance of the Tensor G5 or the slightly larger battery, it's still a win-win if you're coming from a Pixel 8 Pro or older phone.</p><p>Gaming performance and the low PWM dimming display were our biggest gripes with the Pixel 9 Pro, but if these things don't bother you, you should wait for a price drop on the 9 Pro if you don't want to pay sticker price. The Pixel 9 Pro is still one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> that has a lot going for it and is easier to recommend in 2025 if you can find a good deal.

Specifically, Fitbit said, "We're experiencing a major outage," adding that it began around the time user reports appeared on Reddit this morning. Fortunately, as of 10:48 am EST, Fitbit states its mobile app and Web API services have returned "back to normal."

The list of spec improvements seems mostly rudimentary, like that boring phone "upgrade" you made that doesn't really feel any different from your old one. But then I stumbled upon Viture's Immersive 3D feature, which just debuted on Android a few short weeks ago.</p><p>Immersive 3D is a new software feature from Viture that automatically displays your favorite media in 3D without any kind of official support. You don't even need to convert it before watching! Plug your glasses into an Android phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viture.spacewalker">Spacewalker app</a>, then open YouTube, Hulu, or any photos and video stored on your phone itself, and be greeted with glorious 3D footage that wasn't 3D just a moment before.</p><p>I didn't expect this to work very well at all, considering it's just software-driven and many claims about AI enhancements have been overblown in the past. Apple has something similar on its <em>$3,500 headset</em>, but few want to pay that much for the experience. Meta also has something similar on its much more affordable $299 Quest 3S, but it's only easy to access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-beats-android-xr-makes-instagram-scrolling-spatial">while scrolling Instagram</a>. Viture offers this Immersive 3D feature on <em>all</em> its glasses, including the <em>very</em> affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Glasses-Supported-Consoles-Adjustments/dp/B0CS2VZP6B/"><strong>$199 Viture Lite</strong></a>, with a single app install.</p><h2 id="3d-is-in-vogue-again-2">3D is in vogue again</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3" name="viture-spacewalker-3d-photos" alt="A mockup provided by Viture showing what Immersive 3D photos look like in its Spacewalker app on Viture smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qnfz4npQSrri3jiUQtJmL3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With the increasing popularity of smart glasses, people have seemingly rediscovered 3D content again. The obvious issue is that, outside of a few videos and movies that were made over a decade ago when manufacturers were pushing 3D TVs, there's not a ton of native 3D content. There's not even a good way to just play games in 3D, even though that should be a relatively simple task in an era where millions of VR headsets are used every day.</p><p>That's where Immersive 3D comes in. It uses AI to calculate the depth of a 2D source, be it a video, photo, or even a game, although gaming is currently only available for very powerful gaming PCs at the moment. To get a sample of what gaming would feel like, I fired up a full playthrough of Hogwarts Legacy on YouTube and was blown away by the definition and detail I saw through Viture.</p><p>On Android and iOS, Immersive 3D is just another button to press in the Spacewalker app. On a PC or Mac, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://academy.viture.com/xr_glasses/immersive_3d_windows">it's a separate app</a> to install and run. In my experience so far, it's much easier to use the feature on a PC or Mac since <em>everything</em> is converted to 3D, whereas you have to load up specific sources through the Spacewalker app on Android or iOS.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd" name="viture-Spacewalker-launch-youtube" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2gHHxyUTBJw2oib5DyBCd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The bright side of having a dedicated app is that it's much easier to use. Running Immersive 3D on a PC or Mac is simpler and appears to "just work" after launch. I've been using a special pre-release version of Immersive 3D that works very well on Snapdragon X Elite PCs, but Viture says that gamers who want to use this should be using <em>at least</em> a GeForce RTX 4070, something I don't have access to.</p><p>Immersive 3D was released on Android only a month prior to me writing this, and the experience needs a little bit of work before it feels more natural to use. Spacewalker is a decent app and better than what's provided by other smart glasses companies, but that doesn't mean it's a <em>great</em> experience.</p><p>My biggest beef with it is that it doesn't support all apps on your phone; only a handful that Viture has ensured work through its built-in Firefox-based web browser. That's actually an Android security feature, not something Viture can easily bypass without you having root access to your phone. On Windows and Mac, it just works differently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd" name="viture-spacewalker-immersive-3d" alt="How to use Spacewalker's Immersive 3D mode on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eLTeWHPNifphmR7uj43WDd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Viture)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That also means services like Netflix won't work because there's no proper DRM translation through that web browser. Netflix works on the iOS version of Spacewalker with Immersive 3D, and Viture tells me it's working on compatibility for Android. At the very least, it's a reminder that this is still the early days of smart glasses technology, and the software needs further maturation.</p><p>After selecting one of the available services, or a local video or photo, a new hovering button will appear in the bottom-right corner of the screen to launch Immersive 3D. Tap that, and the UI on your phone will change slightly, displaying the video's timeline at the bottom, along with a settings button that allows you to choose between three different 3D settings to optimize your experience.</p><p>Viture maintains a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLosIlwOqL2KaartnAjhY15FD8nlAS3xBI">short YouTube playlist</a> and provides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SPN74tAM8aStTQIG6iHuFKl4Ys9i5VXw">a handful of example photos</a> that you can use to test out the automated 3D translation feature, all of which look <em>very</em> good.</p><h2 id="still-early-days-2">Still early days</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn" name="viture-luma-pro-connected-to-spacewalker-app-on-oneplus-13" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LVRbqfyiypX7eUnwDSXipn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It feels like I'm a broken record when I say "it's still early days," because I said this about VR gaming for the first several years until those titles hit their stride somewhere around 2020. The same mantra goes for XR hardware in general, including VR headsets and smart glasses, and I'm not sure the software side of the equation will be fully solved for smart glasses until <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> starts shipping on them.</p><p>Now, the current Spacewalker process isn't terrible by any means, even if it is limited, but I've found it to be somewhat unreliable and just generally kind of clunky feeling. Several times while surfing through different YouTube videos, the Immersive 3D button would disappear. I usually had to completely shut down Spacewalker and reopen it to get the button back.</p><p>I've also found that it's finicky on some phones, but this isn't always Viture's fault. The app regularly crashed for me on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, while it ran on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> just fine. This is a fresh install on all these phones, so I know it's not some weird cache issue with an older version of the app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4" name="viture-luma-pro-side-logo" alt="A pair of Viture Luma Pro glasses connected to the Spacewalker app running on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AQFNx4MzaoLhVZeiiGMaC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My hope is that Viture can get Spacewalker and/or Immersive 3D upgraded to support <em>all</em> Android apps, not just a very small, select few. This type of compatibility is exactly why Google is developing an entire operating system revolving around XR devices rather than just using an app, the way the company did in the Google Daydream days. I don't think this is possible because of OS-level security, though, and may require separate hardware or an Android XR app to make it happen.</p><p>For now, though, this is a really cool way to reexperience 3D content all over again, even if you don't opt to pay $499 for the latest Viture glasses. It'll be particularly interesting to see how well Immersive 3D holds up once Viture launches its official 3DoF/6DoF capabilities on the Viture Luma line of glasses, as a shifting perspective may not hold up as well with this 3D effect as the current pinned-in-place image does.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="7c89492e-d16b-4c1a-ab72-e8dc7e95d04d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:84.53%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FmK6AgpbTA8sbEbjDYSNNd.jpg' alt="An official product render of Viture Luma Pro"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Viture Luma Pro</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Viture Luma Pro are the best pair of smart glasses the company has ever made, featuring 1200p micro-OLED displays for each eye, a new adjustable frame design, IPD adjustment, and support for all of Viture's massive ecosystem of XR products.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Why would Samsung re-release a last-gen foldable? Since Motorola has been doing so well lately, it would seem that the Korean smartphone maker is trying to compete with the Razr and Razr Plus models. Motorola usually relaunches last year's Plus model as the new basic Razr, while the Plus model is the most improved new foldable. This has been a very successful strategy for the brand, and it seems like Samsung is trying to replicate that with the Flip 7 FE and Flip 7.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-all-colors-04.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JQDxg5MBEMXrw5oXVY9aFd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There are three main differences between the Flip 6 and its revamped Flip 7 FE re-release. To start with, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is much cheaper than the Flip 6. You can currently get the brand new Flip 7 FE with 256GB of storage for $900, however, your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy">color choices are limited to Black and White</a>.

Both variants come with 8GB of RAM.</p><p>On the other hand, the Galaxy Z Flip 6 was priced at $1,100 at launch for the base 256GB/12GB model. With the launch of the new Flip 7 series, you can easily score heavy discounts on the last-gen device, bringing the price down to $900 for the basic variant.</p><p>Memory and price aside, the third most notable difference between the Flip 7 FE and Flip 6 is the processor. The newer Flip 7 FE boasts a slower Exynos 2400 chipset, whereas the older Flip 6 has a superior Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d78d3b6d-9115-4e20-a38d-c402614b575a">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJwtppW9DAGqVEQUiZRVhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It's not all that new</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is the same as the Flip 6, so it can fit in the old-gen Flip's cases like a glove.

The Flip 7 FE is essentially an identical twin to the last-gen Galaxy Z Flip 6, but it's cheaper. The price cut comes with a less powerful Exynos processor.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-color-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-should-you-buy">Flip 6 came in a multitude of colors</a>, ranging from punchy yellows to more sombre shades like black and white. The Flip 7 FE, however, has a much more disappointing number of colorways to offer. Let's take a good look at the options to help you decide which one you like the most.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-color-should-you-buy-2">What Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE color should you buy?</h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="daf04d2f-b14d-4e04-91a3-ebc2349f943b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FbHhKFZhdrMpQBn9V5dZhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE - Black</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>All-black number</strong></em></p><p>You can't go wrong with a little black Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE.

I don't even know if we can call them colors because black and white feel devoid of it. Still, these are the only two options available for this foldable so you'll have to pick either one if you're dead set on getting the Flip 7 FE. Personally, I'd rather get the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a> with a more powerful processor and more diverse color options.</p><p>That being said, I find the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black looks much nicer than the White variant. Not only is it a low-maintenance shade that doesn't get as dirty, but it's also better at visibly minimizing the darkened bezels of the Flip 7 FE's cover screen. White clashes horribly with the fat black borders, enhancing the smallness of the display.</p><p>It's the same with the internal folding screen. Since the Flip 7 FE has the same old inner screen as the Flip 6, the bezels are just as noticeably big. Black bezels and a black frame make it appear as if the bezels are smaller, so you should think twice before placing your order for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in White.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Was it a ball or a strike? How fast was the pitch? Did it break over the plate, and if so, where?</p><p>Then imagine an equally large spreadsheet from the batter's perspective. Did the ball cross the plate in the strike zone, and if so, where? How fast was it? How did the pitch break? Most importantly, did the batter connect with the pitch, and if so, where and how did the ball fly?</p><p>That's an insane amount of information. A perfectly pitched game still has 81 individual pitches, and you'll never see one. With hundreds of pitches and hundreds of games every year, the sheer amount of data is impossible for a person to analyze in real time.</p><p>That's what AI does best, though. Provide the right data for AI to look at, and it can tell you anything. If you tell AI about every seemingly insignificant stat from every single pitch in every MLB game, it can predict what will happen when presented with the real-time data of the current pitch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Say Joe steps up to the plate for his second at-bat. He's warmed up from playing a few innings, Bob the pitcher has loosened up nicely but hasn't blown out his arm yet, and Bob throws a beautiful breaking pitch to start the inning.</p><p>It crosses the plate just above Baseball Joe's knees at 87 mph, and Joe is ready for it. He swings in a low arc and smashes it! All the data from what happens when Bob throws that pitch at that speed across the plate at that spot is there for AI to analyze.</p><p>AI also has data telling it what happens when Joe hits a pitch at that spot and at that speed. Using this historical data, a projected path can be built. Compare that with real-time data collected by the drones and sensors to compensate for things like humidity, and AI has a very good idea of where that ball will land. It will tell us as it's happening, and we love it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB" name="Google-ai-server.jpg" alt="Google Tensor server backdrop on stage at Google I/O 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sWYNyURt2PjsWsE7DxmVHB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4030" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can expand those basics into everything, and it works mostly the same way. For example, you have historical data saved on your phone or in an online account profile. You have real-time data being gathered by your phone or your watch. AI uses the two to "create" an answer for almost any relevant question.</p><p>It can tell you if the sunset will be nice tonight at the beach. It can pair the latest photo you took with a past photo of the same subject for a nice collage. It can predict traffic patterns. It can even estimate when a piece of machinery will need servicing on an assembly line. The functional and useful information it provides uses the same types of patterns as predicting a home run at the All-Star game.</p><p>This is also why AI needs to be fast to be more useful. Telling us where a baseball landed isn't as useful as telling us where it will land, for example.

Predicting that Kyle Schwarber's last swing would fly into the seats to break the tie is a lot easier for a computer algorithm to figure out, and what AI was originally designed to do.</p><p>It's really good at it!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1902e49f-11ee-4e70-8edb-acecb4d8c9b9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQGJNQVqF2XVQV4KfMbN8.jpg' alt="google pixel 9 square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>The best AI phone</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 9</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>AI powerhouse</strong></em></p><p>The Pixel 9 has a premium build, excellent cameras, and better connectivity than its predecessors.

The original poster (OP), VHBlazer, states they received a $96 off discount for the NFL Sunday Ticket as a returning subscriber. The user states they typically subscribe and then kick it after March Madness.</p><p>This was reported earlier this week, and it seems it's still rolling out. Of course, there's likely some underlying conditions there.</p><p>While others have started receiving their emails, they report an interesting occurrence: the price discount is <em>not </em>always the same. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3bwia2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">few users who've been emailed</a> by YouTube TV in hopes of returning claim they've been offered $48 off, instead of $96. It's not exactly clear why there's this gap in discounts.</p><p>On the other hand, some users say they haven't received a "returning user" email, but attempting to return manually shows a discounted price. Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/comment/n3ccf53/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">even report getting the email</a>, yet trying to purchase still shows the full price undiscounted price. Perhaps contacting YouTube TV's support would be beneficial here.</p><h2 id="the-nfl-25-26-season-is-upon-us-2">The NFL '25-'26 Season is upon us</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1m0p9vo/nfl_sunday_ticket_returning_subscriber_deal_96_off">NFL Sunday Ticket returning subscriber deal: $96 off</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv">r/youtubetv</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Back in June, YouTube TV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/huge-youtube-tv-deals-nfl-sunday-ticket-games-2025-season-report">announced some major discounts</a> for new NFL Sunday Ticket holders interested in watching their first season. New consumers purchasing the Season Pass on YouTube can do so for $276, while those on YouTube's Primetime Channels will see it for $318.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that the previous announcement didn't concern recurring or returning NFL Sunday Ticket holders at all. Those users would still see the same full-priced packages. Now, though, with the recent Reddit reports, perhaps YouTube TV is offering a little love to its older, unsubscribed crowd.</p><p>Also, YouTube TV's monthly payment option for the NFL season is rolling out in more States for more users. This should give users a little more flexibility with the NFL Sunday Ticket moving forward. Be warned: YouTube TV states Season Pass' monthly installment plan length will change from 12 months to eight as we near the beginning of the season in September.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a short questionnaire, so the AI knows everything about you and your pet before calling.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1068px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb" name="google-search-have-ai-check-pricing" alt="Google Search is receiving a "Have AI check for pricing" button, which lets it call businesses on your behalf for info." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vQuJoB46hgMcCxuDrrp7yb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1068" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb" name="google-search-ai-calling-update-request-email" alt="Google Search's AI, after calling businesses, will compile its information into an update email for the user, per their request." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GzHR6QLqsnDG2MhASyPxzb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1070" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>It will question you about your pet's breed, weight, what service you're looking for, when you'd like to visit, and your contact information.

This Pro model advances what AI Mode can already do with better reasoning capabilities for math and code-related questions. What's more, AI Mode's Gemini 2.5 Pro integration brings Google's "Deep Search" ability.</p><p>Google says this option, when asking a question, can help "save hours by issuing hundreds of searches, reasoning across disparate pieces of information and crafting a comprehensive, fully-cited report in minutes." In short, Deep Search dives in deep, digging up every bit of information for you on a particular subject and compiling it neatly.</p><p>This is for users who want every piece of information <em>before </em>making an important decision. Since the advanced reasoning and Deep Search are brought to you by Gemini 2.5 Pro, Google says the toggle for it in AI Mode is only available for subscribers. Those with AI Pro or AI Ultra can click "AI Mode" and swap to the 2.5 Pro option for these advanced features if you've enrolled in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/22">Search Labs</a> experiment.</p><h2 id="ai-mode-levels-up-again-2">AI Mode levels up (again)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf" name="Shopping-AI-Mode-checkout" alt="Shopping on AI Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WPwBbvkCNKuxLfmwvPoxZf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In May, during I/O 2025, AI Mode <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">completely stole Google Search's thunder</a> when the company announced Gemini integration. The feature was being granted Gemini 2.5, the predecessor to what the feature is starting to receive today. The model was added to AI Overviews, as well, bringing the intelligence it needed to handle complex queries. This was a custom version of the model that arrived, making it more "ideal" for whatever topic the user was curious about.</p><p>Even shopping with AI Mode was boosted. Users could detail what they're looking for, and the AI's "Shopping Graph" will "browse for inspiration, think through considerations, and narrow down products."</p><p>Google Search itself received a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-astra-joins-gemini-arm-as-google-gears-up-for-public-launch">Project Astra</a> update, letting users speak to Gemini as it looks at the world through your camera.

While they haven't mentioned their source, the spec sheet seems quite thorough.</p><p>To start, the publication notes that the phone's cover display could be a bit larger than the previous model, measuring 6.4 inches. This could be due to the rumored reduction of the cover display’s bezel and the potential reworking of the hinge.  Additionally, the leak suggests that the cover display is also getting a brightness upgrade of up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness, a 10% increase from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-fold-changed-my-mind-about-foldables-but-i-still-prefer-flip-phones">Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</a></p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1412px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-leaked-render-closed" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Pixel 10 Pro Fold in a Porcelain color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hvewYswQphNguzfjxft4Qg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1412" height="794" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Speaking about the device's battery, the leak suggests that it will show up with the largest non-silicon carbon battery, with 5,015mAh capacity and a bump from the 4,460mAh of the previous model. Which means users with this new foldable could use it for a couple more hours than the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The massive battery will supposedly get a 23W wired, 15W wireless (with Qi2) charging compatibility.</p><p>As many previous rumors have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold might be powered by the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> 3nm chipset. However, things remain unchanged when it comes to the phone's camera. According to the website, the phone will sport a 48-megapixel primary camera, a 10.5-megapixel ultrawide, and a 10.8-megapixel 5x telephoto camera. It will also have 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the cover as well as the main display.</p><p>As for the device's storage, the phone might see a higher 1TB option of this foldable, as indicated by a previous leak as well. And these storage options could also be linked to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">color users choose for their device.</a></p><p>Lastly, Android Headlines claims that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first ever foldable to get an IP68 dust and water rating, which is much higher than the Samsung Z Fold 7's rating as well.</p><p>That said, as real as this may seem, this is still just a leak and must be taken with a grain of salt. However, the wait isn't for that long as Google officially announced that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-officially-sets-a-date-for-its-pixel-10-launch-event">Pixel 10 series would be unveiled on Aug. 20 in New York.</a></p> ]]></dc:content>

We've had rumors about the former for a while, but this render suggests there are a couple of key changes inbound. First, the render purports some rather noticeable bezels around the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra, seemingly similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">the Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>However, the tipster's image claims the tablet could see a slightly redesigned selfie camera cutout. Instead of the more boxy look, the Tab S11 Ultra render shows a smaller Infinity-U reminiscent display cutout. It looks like what you'd find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">budget Galaxy A26</a>. It remains to be seen if this new cutout takes away one of the Ultra's two selfie cameras or not. For reference, the Tab S11 Ultra features a 13MP wide and an 8MP ultrawide selfie lens.</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra's rear panel appears mostly the same—clean and clear—but there's one thing missing: the S Pen holder. Other users took note of this, as well, on X (formerly Twitter). It's kicked off some speculation, with some wondering if Samsung moved the strip to the top (side) of the tablet.</p><p>The tipster also highlighted the Galaxy S25 FE, which seems pretty much identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">the Galaxy S25</a> series. The only difference is that Samsung seems to have placed silver rings around its triple camera array, rather than the thicker black rings of the flagship models.</p><h2 id="more-samsung-2">More Samsung</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTS11U / GS25FE pic.twitter.com/yyqVXhzi6z<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1945437427692093702">July 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Rumors about Samsung's next tablet series have been pretty light, other than theories <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">that it's dropping the Plus</a>, bringing only the base and Ultra models. The Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra was reportedly spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-surfaces-stronger-mediatek-database-leaks">moving through Geekbench</a> for its performance tests, and it's said the model sports the boosted MediaTek Dimensity 9400 Plus chip. The chip is a refresh of MediaTek's answer to the Snapdragon 8 Elite from Qualcomm; however, the Tab S11 Ultra supposedly received a score "lower than smartphones."</p><p>The Tab S11 Ultra might also see a battery boost. There was a report that claimed the tablet could jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy S25 FE was allegedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted grabbing Qi2 certification</a>, but the kicker was the WPC's real-life leaked snapshot of the phone. We got a clearer look at the phone's rear panel (and kind of the display), which showed off that small camera array change.</p><p>Samsung's summer Unpacked just went by, so we're looking ahead. The Galaxy S25 FE has been rumored to launch with the Galaxy Tab S11 series, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-series-launch-shortly-samsung-exec-comment-report">reportedly happening "shortly." </a>There's a chance we could see these devices in August or September. The latter option is closer to the company's 2024 tablet reveal.</p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The improved heart rate sensor is substantially more accurate than that of the Watch 6, which is a good reason on its own to snag the watch while it's a little cheaper. It also boasts highly addictive double pinch gestures, health monitoring additions like medication interaction warnings, and a broad swath of Galaxy AI features that make it great.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-7-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fkfzAa3nceSUcsYgLmsYP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YQ3MML" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$329.99" data-dimension48="$329.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$329.99</del> <strong>$199.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>After this year's installment of Amazon Prime Day, the retailer has kept a solid 39% discount on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch 7</a>, representing a whopping $130 off the normal purchase price.

From the highly accurate heart rate, health, and sleep monitoring systems to the easy-to-use Wear OS (now in its fourth generation), the Watch 7 is well-liked by most buyers, and there's a lot to like there. It gets between 30 and 50 hours of battery life per charge, depending on how it's used. And while it doesn't feature the fastest charging speeds in the industry, it makes up for that pretty quickly with its overall performance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

My Galaxy Watch 8 review unit, running One UI 8 Watch, had it from day one, so I've been testing it to see how the experience compares to the old Google Assistant or using Gemini on my phone.</p><p>Gemini recognizes natural language commands more dynamically, provides custom Google Search LLM responses instead of "Here's something I found" summaries, and syncs directly with your Google or Samsung apps so you can (for example) create a Google Calendar reminder or YouTube Music playlist via command.</p><p>My Pixel Watch 3 still runs Google Assistant at the time I'm writing this, so it became my control group against my Galaxy Watch 8 Classic's Gemini. And while I can't say my Gemini experience was perfect, it's certainly a major improvement.</p><h2 id="gemini-on-wear-os-is-a-noticeable-upgrade-over-assistant-2">Gemini on Wear OS is a noticeable upgrade over Assistant</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3276px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-3-Assistant" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEBXRp5fzKVXhMdffXZHb3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3276" height="1843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (left) showing a Gemini summary about antioxidant-rich foods, and the Google Pixel Watch 3 (right) showing an Assistant summary on this topic. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Here's a relevant example. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-hands-on">Galaxy Watch 8</a> has a new antioxidant index that measures carotenoids, the pigments in fruits and veggies that help prevent premature aging and chronic illnesses. So I asked <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Assistant which foods have the most carotenoids.</p><p>Assistant unhelpfully quoted a Mayo Clinic article that confirmed "fruits, vegetables, and whole grains" have carotenoids. Gemini gave actual specifics, then let me create a Google Keep shopping list with the suggested produce pasted.</p><p>I'm also able to ask random on-the-spot questions about things like "the history of carrier pigeons in 30 seconds" and get a relevant, concise answer. I like to skip past the Search AI summary to the actual articles on my laptop browser, but this LLM data is well-suited to on-the-go insights.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Google-Keep-list" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini-created carotenoid-rich foods list added to Google Keep." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e5zrKQnTcq9xMKxpGQhdC4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2249" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My friend told me he loved the new Superman movie, so I asked both assistants about the critical reception. Google Assistant quoted a pithy Rotten Tomatoes' summary, while Gemini offered more nuance and detail about which aspects reviewers liked and disliked.</p><p>More importantly, I asked Gemini for showtimes at my closest theater on Saturday — it pulled data from Search and Maps simultaneously, then had it create a Google Calendar entry for a specific showing and send my fiancée an invite. Google Assistant can do a lot of this <em>individually</em>, but can't multitask in the same way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-calendar-entry" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing the Gemini app creating a Google Calendar entry for the movie Superman." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YhUq95hTSJW3UAhbpTAWS4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini asks Galaxy Watch owners which app they want to default to, such as Samsung Reminders / Google Tasks or Google / Samsung Messages. Once you choose your default apps and give Gemini access, everything speeds up. I had Gemini create reminders, summarize emails, and search for a good nearby Italian restaurant before opening walking directions to it.</p><p>Google Assistant also has some integration with Google apps; Gemini isn't reinventing the wheel. But Gemini does do things more seamlessly and has fewer instances where it "doesn't understand" or can't fulfill my request.</p><h2 id="how-gemini-on-wear-os-can-get-even-better-2">How Gemini on Wear OS can get even better</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini on Wear OS feels pretty polished, considering it's only just launched. I worried about its battery impact, but dozens of Gemini commands and the always-listening "Hey Google" setting only burned about 20% of my Watch 8 Classic battery across a full afternoon. That's faster than normal drain, but even heavy use won't stop you from getting over a day per charge.</p><p>That said, I think Gemini on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatches</a> can get even better! It occasionally gets things wrong and has leaps in logic, but that's normal for LLMs. I have more concrete requests.</p><p>I started adding "in 30 seconds" to info requests because Gemini's long, meandering answers take minutes to read, which isn't always suitable when out and about. Tapping the display silences the AI so you can read the full answer yourself, but I think this version of Gemini might focus more on brevity.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-website-links" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing a Gemini response with websites for a nearby restaurant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a73pnnnWfMtTm4Q5Y8XtK4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There should be a "View on phone" button at the bottom of Gemini replies. As dynamic as this version of Gemini is, there does come a point when pulling out my phone is less time-consuming, and Wear OS should make that transition easier.</p><p>For example, I can ask the Wear OS Gemini for good nearby Indian restaurants and get a list of answers, but it won't show hyperlinks like it does on mobile. I finally got it to share a link to the menu that opened up on my Galaxy phone, but not before a couple of failed attempts where it tried to open the "Naan N Curry app" on my phone.</p><p>Also, unlike the more conversational <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini Live</a>, the Gemini assistant can be bad at knowing when I'm done talking, cutting me off mid-command or halfway through a message. I understand that people don't want to wait around too long, but the AI should be a little more patient.</p><p>Lastly, if and when Google starts supporting the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">One UI 8 Watch Tile format</a> for its own apps, I'd like to see a scrolling Gemini Tile with room for more than two saved commands; ideally, it'd show your recent commands, too, so you could pick up where you left off.</p><p>Overall, replacing Assistant with Gemini is a major net positive. I simply hope that Google continues to optimize this version of the assistant in future updates!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="ced8c3e7-59dd-4ce6-86dc-42f4ef06ddd0">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4tmhPs8yGBuoHYFfdrVvW6.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>New kind of Classic</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic isn't the only Wear OS watch with Gemini, but its fast processor is primed to answer questions speedily, and you'll read responses on its 3,000-nit display.

The post states the update has started as of July 15, and is expected to "reach all devices over the coming weeks." While the OnePlus 13 and 13R don't feature the dedicated Plus Key like the 13s, the post states users with the former can activate Plus Mind using a "three-finger swipe up" on their displays.</p><p>As the update appears, users will soon notice a new Mind Space app appear on the 13 and 13R. Details highlight your ability to send a "wide variety" of information into Plus Mind. OnePlus states this includes your texts, images, webpages, social media posts, and more. What you capture via the screen gesture will be sent to the Mind Space app.</p><p>Additionally, the AI analysis of your content can spot and understand dates and suggest that you put them into your calendar for later.</p><p>For fashion, OnePlus says Plus Mind can "summarize the styles shown" and save that summary within Mind Space with a direct link, so you can revisit it. If there's a lot of content in your Mind Space app, OnePlus says you can leverage AI Search on the 13 and 13R to find things. Knowing the gist of what you're looking for, and also <em>when </em>you might've saved it, can help the AI return useful stored content.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-smart-one-2">It's a smart one</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF" name="OnePlus-AI-Plus-Key" alt="OnePlus AI Plus Key" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WA2j9mRQcKQGWBPHfgbgRF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the OnePlus 13s was on its way, it was made evident that the company had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">ditched the Alert Slider</a> in favor of a new Plus Key. As previously stated, the feature primarily focuses on your screenshots—and placing them in a unique space (Mind Space), so they're not cluttering your memories in the Gallery. Plus Mind's AI suggestions piggyback off OnePlus AI to make saving important dates, locations, and more a breeze.</p><p>This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-launching-in-india-on-july-5">compact flagship is available in India</a>, which meant the rest of us were left waiting (and wondering) if we'd ever see something similar. Users in India are also enjoying AI VoiceScribe, a feature that lets users record, summarize, and translate phone calls and meetings. The Chinese OEM's AI suite has continued to evolve, as we have AI Translation, Search, Reframe, and Perfect Shot to play with.</p><p>However, OnePlus states that there's "more to come," and Plus Mind on the 13 and 13R is a "step in that direction."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Vivo proved last year that it knows how to deliver an all-round package with a sleek design, amazing cameras, and good software features.</p><p>With the X Fold 5, it isn't changing things too much; if anything, the phone is nearly identical to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold 3 Pro</a>. Coming in at 4.3mm, it is among the thinnest tech products you can buy today, but it just misses out on being the thinnest foldable — that honor goes to the 4.2mm Magic V5.</p><p>However, Vivo put a bigger 6,000mAh battery in its foldable, and that ensures the device easily lasts a day even with heavy use. And at 217g, it is 12g lighter than the X200 Ultra, and that in itself highlights just how much foldables have evolved in recent years. Like last year, Vivo is making the X Fold 5 available in several Asian countries, but it won't debut outside the region.</p><p>Having used the X Fold 5 as my daily driver, I'm convinced that it is one of the best foldables you can buy in 2025 — provided you're in a country where Vivo sells the device.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold-5-specs-pricing-and-availability"><span>Vivo X Fold 5: Specs, pricing, and availability</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BQpjW4NAoER92Jcar75qD3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Vivo unveiled the X Fold 5 alongside the new X200 FE on July 14, and the devices are slated to go on sale in select Asian countries over the coming weeks.

There is enough width along the sides to hold the foldable comfortably, and the hinge has smooth articulation. If anything, the hinge has better durability this time around, and it stays unlocked at any angle between 45 and 150 degrees.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="cCJFquE4miGWeKD4ukbzQ3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cCJFquE4miGWeKD4ukbzQ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Most manufacturers are focusing on sleek designs this year, and the X Fold 5 comes in at just 4.3mm while unfolded and 9.2mm when folded. To give you some context, the X200 Ultra is 8.7mm, so the X Fold 5 is only a smidgen bulkier than a regular phone. In fact, you don't even notice that you're using a foldable when interacting with the cover panel, and that is the biggest difference with the latest-gen foldables — they're not unwieldy in the least.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="EBCjuabhaMnWqgY9cePtW3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EBCjuabhaMnWqgY9cePtW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is also lighter than most regular phones at 217g, and what I like is that Vivo somehow managed to bring IP58 and even IP59 ingress protection to the X Fold 5.

Vivo says it is about delivering the right "balance and efficiency," but the manufacturer didn't go into detail as to why it didn't use the 3nm-based 8 Elite over the 4nm 8 Gen 3. It's entirely likely that it wanted to undercut Samsung and Honor, so it utilized last year's platform.</p><p>Thankfully, the 8 Gen 3 still has plenty of power, and I didn't see any slowdowns in the week I used the X Fold 5. It handled demanding games and visually-intensive titles without any issues, and I didn't see much in the way of overheating either. That said, it tends to throttle significantly earlier than regular phones powered by the same silicon. This is the case with other foldables I tested; they just don't have the same thermal management systems, so they tend to throttle sooner to avoid heating issues.</p><div ><table><caption></caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OPPO Find N5</p></th><th  ><p>Vivo X Fold 5</p></th><th  ><p>Honor Magic V3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (single-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2625</p></td><td  ><p>2184</p></td><td  ><p>1600</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench 6 (multi-core)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>7201</p></td><td  ><p>6330</p></td><td  ><p>5293</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Geekbench AI (Quantized Score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2505</p></td><td  ><p>3326</p></td><td  ><p>2923</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>5252</p></td><td  ><p>3740</p></td><td  ><p>4032</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Wild Life Extreme (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>31.45</p></td><td  ><p>22.4</p></td><td  ><p>24.14</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>3DMark Solar Bay (score)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>9898</p></td><td  ><p>5711</p></td><td  ><p>7927</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>3DMark Solar Bay (FPS)</p></td><td  ><p>37.64</p></td><td  ><p>21.72</p></td><td  ><p>30.14</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The vibration motor delivers good feedback, and like last year, Vivo is selling a single 16GB/512GB edition of the device in global markets.

It utilizes silicon-carbon tech, delivering much better density and longevity. With a density of 866Wh/L, it is the densest cell you'll get on a foldable, and Vivo did all the right things in this area.</p><p>I had no issues getting the X Fold 5 to last all day even with heavy use. This was a problem on last year's foldables where they needed to be plugged in before the end of the day, but that just isn't the case this time around. While 80W charging isn't as good as the 100W standard from last year, there isn't much in the way of a difference in real-world usage. The foldable took an hour to charge, and unlike Samsung, you get a charger in the box.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-vivo-x-fold-5-cameras"><span>Vivo X Fold 5: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qU699whHSLyhuU5hviApT3" name="Vivo X Fold 5" alt="Vivo X Fold 5 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qU699whHSLyhuU5hviApT3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>You get three 50MP cameras at the back with Zeiss tuning. </strong></li><li><strong>It has the best cameras of any foldable right now. </strong></li></ul><p>Vivo slotted in a 50MP Sony IMX921 as the main camera on the X Fold 5, and it is joined by a 50MP Samsung JN1 module that acts as the wide-angle lens, and a 50MP Sony IMX882 as the tele lens with 3x optical zoom.

It may not be at the same level as the X200 Pro, but it is better than every other foldable I used. Daylight shots have good detail and colors, and it holds up just as well in challenging situations, producing vibrant photos with minimal noise levels.</p><p>The auxiliary cameras are pretty good too, and like every other Vivo phone I tested in 2025, you get standout portrait shots.

The UI itself is fluid, and I didn't see any issues in the week I used the X Fold 5. I prefer Funtouch OS to ColorOS or OxygenOS now, and that's one of the reasons why I used the X200 Pro as my daily driver for a good chunk of 2025.

Compare that to your current phone bill and tell me it doesn't sound good. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/phone-plans/12-month-plans/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d82427d5-ec0f-4872-9a51-0ec91469d5bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile" data-dimension48="Get 50% off one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint Mobile">View Deal</a></p></div><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want Unlimited wireless for dirt cheap; you don&apos;t mind paying for a full year of service in advance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don&apos;t want to commit to a year of one wireless plan; you need more perks or you regularly use over 35GB of data in a month. </p><p>Owned and operated by T-Mobile, Mint Mobile is a popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNO carrier</a> that works by selling its wireless in 3, 6, and 12-month increments of time. Although you have to pay a bit more for the wireless upfront, it generally becomes quite cheap once you break the costs down month to month. This makes Mint a convenient choice for folks who want to drop a chunk of cash and not think about their phone bill again for a while.</p><p>As described above, the Unlimited plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile&apos;s vast 5G network. High-speed data is technically capped at 35GB per month, after which speeds <em>could</em> slow if the network becomes congested. Aside from a free mobile hotspot and a few international benefits, there also aren&apos;t as many perks as you might get from other wireless carriers, but that&apos;s a small price to pay when you consider the value here. </p><p>I&apos;ll put it this way: Mint is a simple, affordable carrier for folks who want simple, affordable wireless. And if you&apos;ve been thinking about switching anyway, this deal presents an outstanding opportunity. </p><h2 id="need-a-new-phone-too-2">Need a new phone too?</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:204px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:121.08%;"><img id="Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV" name="google-pixel-9-render-obsidian.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8nScb7AAtxK4j2d2EnxjV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="204" height="247" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 9 128GB:</strong> <a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799"><del>$799</del> <strong>$359, plus BOGO year of Unlimited at Mint Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Mint is also home to a ton of great phone deals, such as this offer that slashes over 50% off the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a> AND throws in a free year of Unlimited when you bundle the purchase of the phone with one year of service.</p><p>In other words, you're getting a top-rated flagship phone along with two full years of T-Mobile-powered wireless for only $719 (or $30 per month when you pay using affirm). <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e4f03dbe-b4ed-498c-8893-2a6492d77f69" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li> <strong>More MVNO deals: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/plans/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://deals.boostmobile.com/mypromo/trial-mybm"><u><strong>Boost</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://tello.com/buy/custom_plans"><u><strong>Tello</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans"><u><strong>Cricket</strong></u></a> </li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The survey runs through the typical checks and balances; however, the publication noticed two important questions, each regarding Qi2 wireless charging and its magnetic hardware.</p><p>Arguably, the most important question is number 38, which says, "Would you prefer to have magnets built into the phone even if it made the phone thicker?" Two of the answers say you wouldn't mind Qi2 magnets within the device, even if it made the phone "within 0.3mm" or "within 0.5mm" larger. These aren't outlandish differences, especially considering Samsung's recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">thin phone era</a>, but that tech inside would <em>slightly </em>enlarge things.</p><p>The publication details another option that says you wouldn't want Qi2 magnets inside if it made the phone larger, while the final choice says "magnets must be included," no matter the increase.</p><p>The other question poses an interesting scenario: what if a Galaxy phone <em>only </em>had wireless charging? Samsung asks, "if only wireless charging is supported, would having Qi2 (like MagSafe) reduce any inconveniences?"</p><h2 id="samsung-qi2-2">Samsung & Qi2</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87" name="magsafe-ring-adapter-silicone-case-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Silicone Case with MagSafe ring and PopSocket" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWWfZpcMJ4FtKCt4VctQ87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's recent history with Qi2 on the Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-and-the-wpc-have-officially-made-qi2-on-android-confusing">has been incredibly confusing</a>, but it all boils down to a simple answer. Samsung's latest flagship series is the first set of phones to feature "Qi2 Ready support;" however, these devices don't feature the required magnets within themselves. So, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">yes, the Galaxy S25 series offers wireless charging</a>, thanks to Qi2, but only at 15W.</p><p>If you're interested in grabbing a Qi2 charger, the Galaxy S25 series will be compatible with it. One thing you should note is that, without the magnets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-cases">you will need a case</a> that brings the necessary built-in magnets for that.</p><p>Perhaps we can speculate that Samsung dropped these magnets to make its series thinner, especially after seeing the recent consumer survey. That's not exactly confirmed, so it's just food for thought. There's also no telling when/if Samsung would even provide built-in magnets for its devices. The Galaxy S26 series comes to mind. We'd only hear something actionable early next year, if it does.</p><p>The company's rumored Galaxy S25 FE was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-fe-wpc-listing-qi2-info-real-life-image-report">spotted moving through the WPC</a> for wireless charging, to which it received Qi2 (v2.1) certification. However, given speculation that says we might see this phone later this year, we might not see these built-in magnets for this model. If anything, the S25 FE will fit closer to the others with 15W wireless charging and the necessity for a case.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Kang praised the foldables, stating they are "perfect hardware innovations that perfectly complete the first generation of foldables and open up the next generation."</p><p>One of the most substantial changes occurred within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, which thinned down to 8.9mm (unfolded) and 4.2mm (folded). Kang states this was a product of consumers wanting something "thin and light." However, Samsung understands that not everyone may enjoy its sacrifices: notably, the S Pen. Samsung is reportedly looking into R&D means for new technologies within a future S Pen to make it thinner.</p><p>For now, Kang states consumers should look at the Fold 7 as a "trade-off," adding, "where you lose one if you choose one."</p><p>The publication highlights Kang's additional statement, claiming Samsung won't do anything that sticks until there's a certain level of "perfection." Moreover, "consumer demand" is another major catalyst behind the S Pen's potential return. The post mentions the Fold 7's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">Armor Flex Hinge</a>, which is lighter and thinner than the Fold 6's hinge, further facilitating a slimmer phone.</p><h2 id="the-s-pen-lingers-2">The S Pen lingers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on-32" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 hinges hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eywqvFaRMzpU9poUfE3Cr3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Flip 7 was also discussed, as Samsung finally <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-flip-7-fold-7-flagship-launch-flip-7-fe">provided it with a full cover display</a> (4-inch) that reaches edge-to-edge for a more immersive experience. Samsung worked in a more "compact" form factor for the device, while also boosting its battery by ~300mAh to 4,300mAh.</p><p>You may remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">some earlier rumors</a> that said the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would debut with a standalone S Pen that required charging. That didn't happen. The reason for this memory jog is that rumors claimed this S Pen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-next-galaxy-z-fold-phone-might-work-with-an-s-pen-you-need-to-charge">would need to be charged</a> (since there's no digitizer), <em>and </em>the pen would be slightly larger. Speculation claimed Samsung was looking into adding active electrostatic (AES) technology so the pen could manage its own operations. Such additions would likely expand its size, but taking into account Kang's comments, perhaps Samsung is moving in a different direction.</p><p>For now, our current reality is this: the Galaxy Z Fold 7 has no S Pen. If you're interested in that useful tool, you'll have to look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">the Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Samsung's executive vice president and head of customer experience, Patrick Chomet, once told CNET, "We could put it in, but it's not the main feedback from people, and therefore getting it thinner and lighter is more important."</p><p>This pretty much echoes what Kang Min-seok said after Samsung's summer Unpacked. Chomet added, "Many people use the S Pen, but far from the majority of users."</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The issue has been reported to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://0din.ai/blog/phishing-for-gemini" target="_blank">0din</a>, Mozilla’s AI-focused bug bounty program (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-gemini-flaw-hijacks-email-summaries-for-phishing/" target="_blank">BleepingComputer</a>).</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-is-now-in-gmail-to-write-summaries-and-craft-replies-on-the-fly">slipped Gemini into its Workspace apps a while back</a>, and one of its handy tricks is breaking down your emails. Just slide open the side panel in Gmail, and Gemini will be able to pull key details or turn messages into calendar events on the fly.</p><p>But here’s the scary part: this feature also opens the door to “prompt-injection” attacks. If someone slips a sneaky prompt into an email, Gemini might run it right in the side panel, and the user might not even notice.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2381px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.82%;"><img id="LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LW7Ernz47VjzFbTtMribx7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2381" height="1972" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2620px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:84.20%;"><img id="DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28" name="Google-Gemini-summary-in-Gmail" alt="malicious Gemini summary in Gmail" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DfyQnL4ArCprqhzstuyD28.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2620" height="2206" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Marco Figueroa / Odin)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Hackers can hide secret commands in emails using simple HTML and CSS tricks like white text on a white background or font size zero. You won’t notice a thing, but Gemini will read it loud and clear, and that’s where things can go sideways.</p><p>Since these sneaky emails skip the usual red flags (no sketchy links or shady attachments), they often slip right past Google’s spam filters and land straight in your inbox.</p><h2 id="wolf-in-google-s-clothing-2">Wolf in Google’s clothing</h2><p>Gemini sees those hidden prompts as legit and spits them out in the email summary with zero warnings. Since it’s coming from Google’s own AI, it looks totally above board, which means most folks won’t even think to question it. That false sense of trust is what makes this so dangerous.</p><p>According to BleepingComputer, even though prompt injection has been on the radar since 2024 and some guardrails are already in place, this tactic still works. That means the current defenses aren’t quite keeping up with how crafty attackers are getting.</p><p>Google says there’s no sign of hackers actually using this trick in real-world attacks thus far. But the research clearly shows it can be done, which raises a big red flag. Just because it hasn’t hit the wild yet doesn’t mean it’s not a serious threat waiting to happen.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company has upgraded the Phone 3 with a faster processor and better cameras. The Phone 3 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-grabs-snapdragon-8s-gen-4-for-its-upcoming-flagship-phone-3">opted for Qualcomm's</a> Snapdragon 8s Gen 4, instead of the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Skipping all the jargon, Nothing CEO Carl Pei said the chip helps make the phone feel "a lot snappier."</p><p>The phone's rear camera array consists of three 50MP lenses, and Nothing even popped one onto the front. One of the larger changes regards the Phone 3's Glyph Lighting, or rather lack thereof. Nothing has implemented instead its new GlyphMatrix, a smaller circular display on the back of the phone. Users can switch between a battery indicator, a stopwatch, a mirror, a digital clock, a solar clock, and more on this Matrix.</p><p>The Headphone 1, the company's first over-ear headset, features a set of physical buttons, a paddle, and roller control. It feels a little more retro, but with Nothing's eye-catching design. The Headphone 1 packs ANC that can adapt to your surroundings, so you're tunes never feel out of... tune.</p><h2 id="committing-to-the-phone-3-2">Committing to the Phone 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR" name="Nothing Phone 3" alt="Nothing Phone 3 review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XCAUZSvDwAK6rYDD9YsERR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In June, amidst Nothing's preparations for the Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-android-os-upgrades-five-year-confirmation">the company confirmed</a> that it is going to provide five major Android OS upgrades for the device. Joining those five major Android updates are seven years of security updates, just to take users a little further.

So you can still give an important app a "full" Tile space, but group other apps below it, if you prefer.</p><p>Unfortunately, Google and third-party apps only have traditional, full-Tile layouts; they don't appear as an option when you edit multi-app Tiles. The Gemini tile, for example, already has the Wear OS 6 look, with rounded edges and finite space for two saved commands.</p><p>I assume (or at least hope) Samsung will let other Wear OS app developers make their own mini-Tile views. Because they've become an instant favorite, allowing me to fit more apps into my routine without having to commit an <em>entire</em> Tile to something I won't use every day.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-and-pixel-watch-4-took-two-different-tile-paths-2">The Galaxy Watch 8 and Pixel Watch 4 took two different Tile paths</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG" name="Wear-OS-6-Google-Home" alt="The new Google Home tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing options to check your Kitchen, Thermo, Custom, Doorbell, and Bedroom controls." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a5EjfN7gpNfWueZfXrEVRG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3864px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9" name="Wear-OS-6-Gmail" alt="The new Gmail tile for "Your mail" on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing two emails about lunch and dinner from different contacts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m23b4XmgZ7iRAitHxemYX9.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3864" height="2173" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3651px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF" name="Wear-OS-6-weather" alt="The new Weather tile on Wear OS 6, showing three narrow tiles for Now, 5PM, and 6PM temperatures in London." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ouoJQnbvKuG5jyCyzkp4nF.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3651" height="2054" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2990px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV" name="Wear-OS-6-Contacts" alt="The Contacts Tile on Wear OS 6 on the Pixel Watch 3, showing different contact icons for individual numbers and an All Contacts button on the bottom edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcUnxsaZ9dN3FXm9rwZWKV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2990" height="1682" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">tried out Wear OS 6 at Google I/O</a>, I was impressed by Google's redesigned Tiles because they took full advantage of the display space. You can avoid opening individual apps because the Tile will jump-start your search for the most relevant information or shortcuts.</p><p>Now that I've seen Samsung's take on Wear OS 6, I find this fundamental difference fascinating. Samsung's Tiles system feels much more like customizing your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> home screen so that you can swipe left to your organized apps and widgets.

For one, I prefer seeing more information at once, even if it's smaller. For another, I find it easier to scroll <em>down</em> through one themed Health tile and decide which option to tap, rather than have to memorize my Tile order and settle on one thing at a time.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Tile-size-options" alt="The "Add Tile" view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic showing two sizes of Antioxidant Index widget." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DLCGjr9DFQ9njdP3sthmNE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">Two Tile size options for the Antioxidant Index metric </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-Gemini-Tile" alt="The Gemini widget on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hneykTF6dBRcXqpuyjFdTE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1687" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="caption-text">One fixed size option for the Gemini Tile </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>I'm not writing off the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> UI until I thoroughly test it.

Think of it a bit like when Bob Ross dips his paintbrush into a crimson red, then an azure blue to make some kind of lovely purple for a mountainscape.</p><p>But temporal dithering, also known as FRC or Frame Rate Control, is different. Instead of just showing a solid set of colors to create one color, temporal dithering flashes subpixels back and forth between colors to create a color that doesn't exist. Your eye sees this "new" color because that's how the human eye works. Flash something fast enough in front of one, and it starts seeing a solid or moving image instead of a series of flashing images.</p><p>It's a clever engineering trick that saves companies R&D dollars, allowing them to use cheaper panels and still get away with saying their phones or displays show "billions of colors," even if they technically can't. But of course, just as is the case with PWM dimming, displaying a flashing light or color to some people will cause them to get headaches, nausea, or, at worst, a seizure.</p><h2 id="avoiding-it-is-nearly-impossible-2">Avoiding it is nearly impossible</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS" name="dithering-testing-using-microscrope-on-honor-tablet-02" alt="Testing to see if the Honor Pad V9 uses temporal dithering by using a OnePlus 13's 480FPS slow motion video and a Carson MicroFlip smartphone microscope" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fvNWBxgkDjJ6KhdDS5KeaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>People sensitive to temporal dithering have a much harder time finding suitable devices for three main reasons. First, while some monitor companies readily list FRC on spec sheets, smartphone companies do not.</p><p>That means the only way to know if a phone or tablet uses dithering is by either experiencing symptoms or finding a review that dives deep into the display. I try to include these numbers on any review I publish, but I'm just one person, and there are far too many devices for me to be able to test on my own.</p><p>Aside from finding the existence of flickering itself, there's no published rate at which these pixels flicker. At least with PWM dimming, most manufacturers now advertise the existence of PWM dimming and the dimming rate. Phones from brands like Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel run at a very slow 240-480Hz rate, while other brands like OnePlus and Honor push that number up to between 2160Hz and 4320Hz. The faster, the better for humans.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C" name="iqoo-z10-neo-eye-care-settings" alt="Eye protection settings on the Iqoo Z10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ibisLkmWgzvsbXc5DkEa3C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No one knows how fast pixels flash when temporal dithering is used, outside of the engineering teams that create the algorithms, of course. Because of this, there's no way to know which phones have a "safe" level of flickering and which are bad for you. All we know is that when phones employ temporal dithering, some users experience real pain and cannot use those phones.</p><p>Lastly, there's no specific color, app, or even activity on the phone that could trigger temporal dithering to activate. Some companies use temporal dithering around the edge of text to make it smoother or more "readable," while other companies may use it to enhance animations and make them more attractive looking. It's a total mixed bag, and it makes figuring out the right phone an extraordinarily difficult process if you're sensitive to it!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP" name="temporal-dithering-example-oled" alt="An example comparing OLED panels that use color dithering/FRC to another panel that does not" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GPQxq6ULrrsVCE5YV6cHtP.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to test for yourself, I recommend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Carson-Microscope-Smartphone-Digiscoping-MP-250/dp/B015MS8O48/">this $20 smartphone microscope</a> from Amazon. Find a phone that can do at least 240FPS slow motion video capture — I prefer the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-review">OnePlus 12</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> because both phones can capture 480FPS slow motion — and run the microscope over different parts of the screen.</p><p>I often test around the edges of text, on different icons on the home screen, and on both a rainbow gradient and a grayscale gradient. If you see pixels "dancing" between colors, it's likely your display dithers. Check out the GIF above to see what it might look like, as an example.</p><p>The subpixels on the right side are flashing between two colors constantly, while the display on the left is displaying solid colors. This was captured on what looks to my eyes like a solid color, so this movement isn't the result of an animation on screen.</p><h2 id="what-s-the-solution-2">What's the solution?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-nxtvision-settings" alt="Adjusting the NXTVISION settings on an NXTPAPER 4.0-powered TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Jka6Qc2Xbz5VGGfLnce8Ro.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most immediate thing you can do <em>right now</em> is hop over to the AOSP issue tracker and click the +1 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/430486442">on the temporal dithering issue</a>. If you're affected, share your story in the comments and officially put your name on the tracker. It's like signing a petition, but with a lot more weight behind it. This tells Android engineers that this issue needs to be prioritized in future Android updates. Otherwise, they have no idea there's a problem!</p><p>Now, on to the companies that make the smartphones. Since 10-bit color has become the new industry standard for display excellence, companies need to use 10-bit displays whenever possible. An 8-bit screen can display 256 different shades of red, green, or blue in its subpixels, while a 10-bit screen ramps this up to a possible 1024 hues per subpixel.</p><p>In general, only OLED can properly display 10-bit color without any sort of dithering nonsense. If you see an LCD that claims it's 10-bit, the manufacturer is likely being misleading. Even many 8-bit LCDs use 6-bit panels and employ FRC/dithering to achieve an 8-bit or 10-bit color palette.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d" name="mudita-kompact-vs-minimal-phone-back-cameras-03" alt="Comapring the camera software on the Minimal Phone to the Mudita Kompakt" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZsffDvc8HtLMyGPmSzt8d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The problem with OLED is that it cannot be fully DC-dimmed like a traditional lightbulb. There is no such thing as a completely flicker-free OLED. It's impossible. Instead, there are "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">safe ranges</a>" that exist for most users, but a subset of users will never be able to use OLED because of this problem.</p><p>Those folks <em>need</em> an accessibility option that allows them to disable dithering or FRC completely. Otherwise, the only safe options are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/an-e-ink-phone-isnt-something-you-just-switch-to-in-one-day">E Ink phones</a>, and all of those have some sort of significant limitations for modern workflows or usages. I recently wrote about how TCL has removed temporal dithering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/tcl-nxtpaper-4-fixes-one-of-the-technologys-biggest-hidden-issues">on its latest NXTPAPER 4.0 tablets</a> when using specific settings, and we need to see other manufacturers start doing the same.</p><p>This is particularly important for LCDs, as users who are the most sensitive to flicker either have to choose between an LCD or an E Ink device. Introducing something like FRC/dithering to an LCD completely defeats the point of these displays as a safe medium, and both hardware manufacturers and OS developers like Google need to implement ways of turning this off completely.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC" name="tcl-nxtpaper-11-plus-vs-honor-pad-v9-home-screens" alt="Comparing the displays between the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus and the Honor Pad V9" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5zAVBxAPszK4664MpG9UeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The aforementioned Android bug report has already been assigned to an engineer and tagged as a "feature request" in hopes of getting a new accessibility option for affected users. Google has had accessibility options in place for color blind users for years, which statistically make up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.colourblindawareness.org/colour-blindness/">less than 4%</a> of the world's population. We don't know the number of people negatively affected by color dithering, but we know that people who <em>are</em> affected by it cannot use any phone with it at all.</p><p>This is an important differentiator between some accessibility options, which are made simply for comfort or convenience reasons, and the one we're asking Google to make. Without this new option, an entire subset of users may be unable to use any Android phones at all, especially as support for older phones ends.</p><p>Android is, by far, the world's largest operating system, and that statistic isn't changing anytime soon. Now that we know Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">is combining ChromeOS and Android</a>, that number is only going to get higher. Now is the time to act, Google. I know you can do it, and now that you know it's a problem, I hope it's only a matter of time before we get a fix.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="e8f55126-665c-4040-82a7-4eb43977e555">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zcr4Z8qwujAeqMm5gfzGGn.jpg' alt="An official render of the TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus tablet's display and rear camera module"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">TCL NXTPAPER 11 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>TCL's latest tablet employs NXTPAPER 4.0, the newest evolution in TCL's unique ePaper display that features even better eye comfort modes than previous generations.

The company teased today a glammed-out Razr 2025.</p><p>YTECHB previously reported about a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-allegedly-preparing-crystal-bedazzled-razr-2025-leak">leaked render showing a crystal-covered Motorola Razr</a>, hinting at a design echoing the special edition Buds Loop. Motorola’s latest teaser seems to back it up, and according to the same leak, the phone is coming in an “Ice Blue” finish.</p><p>The short clip shows crystals being carefully embedded into the Buds Loop, hinting that this similar style is coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Razr 2025</a>.

So, if you were hoping for a bedazzled Razr Plus or Ultra, it’s probably not happening.</p><p>This special edition likely won’t bring major spec changes compared to the standard Razr 2025. With the base model already packing solid upgrades, the Swarovski version is all about the looks: a polished finish on an already refined device.</p><p>We're counting down the days to August 5 to see the full reveal of this new collaboration.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The 45mm model goes by the codename “kenari” (FK23), and the 41mm one is called “meridian” (FME23)—both nods to Star Wars planets, which is a fun shift from Google’s usual god-themed names.</p><p>As usual, expect both LTE and Wi-Fi-only versions for each size.</p><p>Google might be putting in the work to squeeze out every drop of efficiency. The report notes a slight battery bump for both Pixel Watch 4 models: a 7% boost for the 41mm and a 9% jump for the 45mm with a 459mAh cell. It’s not a huge leap, but it could help stretch out battery life just a bit more on Google’s next-gen watch.</p><p>Additionally, faster charging is reportedly on the way.

This discovery, powered by insights from the Google Threat Intelligence Group, shows how AI can now catch bugs before they blow up.</p><p>Big Sleep was built to think like a human security expert, digging through code and spotting shady behaviors just like a real researcher would. Google also designed it to catch sneaky twists on known bugs, which are a goldmine for hackers looking to mess with modern software.</p><p>Additionally, Google’s open-source digital forensics tool, Timesketch, is getting a powerful AI boost. Backed by a new model called Sec-Gemini, the upgraded platform can now do some of the heavy lifting in forensic investigations, like sifting through logs and flagging potential threats. This means less work for analysts and much faster incident response. A live demo is set for Black Hat USA.</p><h2 id="facade-google-s-secret-insider-threat-catcher-2">FACADE: Google’s secret insider threat catcher</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1466px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW" name="android-security.jpg" alt="Android logo on a phone with a padlock in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJDyHw3W2cZ9f9auHorGW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1466" height="825" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Another internal tool is stepping into the spotlight. Google will share a behind-the-scenes look at FACADE, its insider threat detection system that’s been quietly monitoring billions of daily events since 2018. It doesn’t need training data from past attacks to spot anomalies, thanks to a machine learning approach called contrastive learning.</p><p>At DEF CON 33, Google is also co-hosting a Capture the Flag (CTF) event with Airbus. Teams will get help from AI assistants to tackle a wide range of security puzzles. It’s a fresh spin that puts AI in the trenches with security pros and hobbyists alike.</p><p>Google is also putting its weight behind safer AI development. It’s donating data from its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-saif-risk-assessment-security-threats-details">Secure AI Framework</a> (SAIF) to the Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI), helping fuel work around agentic AI, software supply chain security, and cyber defense. This move follows the initiative's launch at last year’s Aspen Security Forum.</p><p>And finally, next month marks the end of the AI Cyber Challenge (AIxCC), a DARPA-led competition supported by Google. The winners will show off new AI tools built to find and fix vulnerabilities in major open-source software, a major step forward for proactive digital defense.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are three case sizes in total: 40mm, 44mm, and 46mm. You can get the Galaxy Watch 8 in 40mm or 44mm sizes, with both options available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-color-should-you-buy">Graphite and Silver colorways</a> each. Meanwhile, the upsized Galaxy Watch 8 Classic with the popular rotating bezel is only available in one 46mm case size. Customers can choose from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/which-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-color-should-you-buy">Black and White color options</a> when shopping for the Watch 8 Classic.</p><p>Choosing the right case size when buying a wearable depends on the size of your wrists. If you've got big hands, a larger case size like 44mm or 46mm, is best suited. Something as small as 40mm may not be proportional and might end up looking strange or funny. You don't want to seem like you accidentally wore a kids' smartwatch.</p><p>Naturally, the petite 40mm case size looks the most aesthetically pleasing on tinier wrists. It's also more functional. You don't want an oversized, chunky wearable that covers the entirety of your wrist, feels heavy, and ends up knocking around every single thing in close proximity to your hands.</p><p>Small wrists have a disadvantage when looking at the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, because it only comes in a gigantic 46mm case size. So you'll be stuck between the Watch 8's 40mm or 44mm variants if you have smaller hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, Galaxy Z Fold users might have also gotten something they <em>didn't</em> want, and that's the $2,000 starting price of the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>For those keeping track at home, that makes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> the most expensive Samsung foldable to ever launch in the U.S. It's even pricier than the original Galaxy Z Fold that launched in 2019 for $1,980. Of course, inflation, tariff uncertainty, and a host of other factors might explain the price hike, but this just goes to show that the decision of whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is more complicated than ever.</p><p>People considering an upgrade will have to look at their current phone and figure out whether having the newest Samsung foldable is worth the high cost. For anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">recent foldable</a> from Samsung, Google, or OnePlus, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably out of reach — unless you take advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-deals">insane pre-order trade-in deals</a>. It's easier to justify an upgrade with an older model because the changes compound across multiple generations.</p><p>Let's dive into the Galaxy Z Fold 7's price and specs to help you figure out whether you should upgrade or pass.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-galaxy-z-fold-6-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Galaxy Z Fold 6?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-mint-hands-on-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 Mint" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5naTkQoLMYoejCq4GVAp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> was already a standout foldable, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 builds off those initial upgrades. Is there enough added to the newer model to make current owners want to upgrade? That probably depends on who you ask. There are a lot of noticeable changes, but it'll be tough to justify spending $2,000 on a foldable just one year after spending $1,900 on the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">major differences between these two models</a> will be their display sizes and form factors. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has bigger inner and outer screens, measuring 8 inches on the main display and 6.5 inches on the cover screen. That's up from a 7.6-inch main screen and a 6.3-inch cover screen on the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Most importantly, the newer model has a wider cover screen, which should make typing and general use more comfortable.</p><div ><table><caption>Specifications </caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Folding display</p></td><td  ><p>8-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2184 x 1968 QXGA+</p></td><td  ><p>7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2160 x 1856 resolution, 20.9:18 aspect ratio, 374 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cover display</p></td><td  ><p>6.5-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X, 2520 x 1080 HD+, Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2</p></td><td  ><p>6.3-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x, LTPO (1-120Hz), 2376 x 968 resolution, 22.1:9 aspect ratio, 410 ppi, 2600 nits peak brightness, 480Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Operating System</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (One UI 8)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 14 (One UI 6.1.1) [upgradeable]</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor </p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td><td  ><p>12GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, or 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery </p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td><td  ><p>4,400mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging </p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td><td  ><p>25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, 4.5 reverse wireless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear cameras </p></td><td  ><p>200MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main + 12MP ultrawide + 10MP telephoto (3x optical zoom)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Selfie cameras </p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 10MP (folding display)</p></td><td  ><p>10MP (cover display) + 4MP (folding display)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>158.4 x 72.8 x 8.9 mm (folded); 158.4 x 143.2 x 4.2 mm (unfolded)</p></td><td  ><p>Folded (68.1 x 153.5 x 12.1 mm); Unfolded (132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>215g</p></td><td  ><p>239g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver Shadow, Blue Shadow, Jetblack</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Shadow, Pink, Navy</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <em>significantly</em> thinner and lighter than its predecessor, which is probably the most compelling reason to upgrade. It's only 8.9mm thick when closed, and that means you can add a case to it if you'd like while still remaining under the Galaxy Z Fold 7's 12.1mm thickness. Meanwhile, the new version weighs only 215 grams, and that's less than every big flagship from Apple, Google, and Samsung.</p><p>Hardware upgrades are a mixed bag. The new model has the advantage of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> and a 200MP camera, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6's comparable offerings are no slouch. You probably won't notice that big of a difference in performance during daily use. Plus, the amount of RAM, battery capacity, and charging speed is completely unchanged between models.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok" name="Galaxy Z Fold 6" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GSHxjmX6g4vapZfroJDaok.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 half-opened with the display on.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While it would be nice to have the thinner and lighter Galaxy Z Fold 7, most Galaxy Z Fold 6 users should probably stick with the phone they have for another year.

It was tough to go from Galaxy S25 Edge to a thicker device, and I absolutely noticed a difference holding the Galaxy Z Fold 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>Still, we're talking about $2,000 here. Unless you have boatloads of cash, there just isn't enough to justify the upgrade from the prior model.

Even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>, which is only two years old, is starting to show its age. It has a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip that wasn't built for the AI era, and a 6.2-inch cover screen that isn't wide enough by 2025 standards. Additionally, the phone's 252-gram weight and 13.4mm thickness when folded is pretty chunky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>.</p><p>There are positives to sticking with the Galaxy Z Fold 5, as it has the same battery capacity, charging speed, and secondary cameras as the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7.

These Galaxy foldables had the older wedge-shaped hinge with a gap between the two halves of the phone. This not only made the foldables thicker but also less durable. Samsung's hinge design and build quality have vastly improved since this generation of foldables, and there are many reasons to upgrade.</p><p>For those with a Galaxy Z Fold 5 or a Galaxy Z Fold 4, an upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes a lot of sense. Samsung is offering $900 of trade-in credit for the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and $800 for the Galaxy Z Fold 4 toward the newer model, which is excellent. It means your device will have retained about half of its value even after two or three years of use. If you like the Galaxy Z Fold form factor and have no regrets, I'd jump on this Galaxy Z Fold 7 pre-order offer now before your phone loses value.</p><h2 id="should-you-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-from-a-pixel-fold-pixel-9-pro-fold-or-oneplus-open-2">Should you upgrade to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 from a Pixel Fold, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anyone with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Google Pixel Fold</a>, Pixel 9 Pro Fold, or OnePlus Open should probably take a pause before jumping toward the new Galaxy Z Fold 7.

Many of Samsung's new additions, like a wider cover screen and thin form factor, have been staples of Google and OnePlus foldables.</p><p>For example, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is the thinnest foldable available in the U.S., the Pixel 9 Pro Fold measures 10.5mm when folded, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/you-should-love-the-oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a> measures 11.7mm when folded. Both of those are still thinner than the Galaxy Z Fold 6.

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-107">What you need to know</h2><ul><li>In a brief video, Anbernic announced its latest gaming handheld, the RG477M.</li><li>This marks the first Anbernic handheld with a metal shell to be released since the RG405M in 2023.</li><li>Other details are scarce, but there's a good chance it features similar specs to the RG557.</li></ul><p>In the time that Anbernic last launched a handheld with a metal shell, the company has released 22 different retro and Android gaming handhelds. That streak will soon be broken, as the RG477M was announced in a 21-second video published to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@anbernic">Anbernic's YouTube channel</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RBArKfpkZE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The company didn't provide any further details besides showing off some quick B-roll footage. This confirmed the metal shell along with the button, joystick, and D-pad placement. And although it wasn't mentioned, it's safe to assume that the joysticks will have RGB lighting, based on the close-up shots in the video.</p><p>However, based on Anbernic's history, there are a few gaps we can try to fill just from the name. With only a couple of exceptions, the majority of Anbernic handhelds carry a naming scheme of "RGXXYZZ," and are broken down as such:</p><ul><li><strong>XX -</strong> Screen Size</li><li><strong>Y - </strong>Processor</li><li><strong>ZZ -</strong> Version</li></ul><p>So, looking at the RG477M, Anbernic's next handheld will feature a 4.7-inch screen. The "7" likely denotes a more powerful chip, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gemini-notebooklm-gaming-guide-creation">RG557</a>, making use of the MediaTek Dimensity 8300. And the "M" simply denotes that it will feature a metal shell.</p><p>Provided that Anbernic doesn't throw a curveball, it's pretty safe to assume that the RG477M will feature similar internals to those of the RG557. In addition to the Dimensity 8300, the RG557 includes 12GB of RAM and 128GB of expandable storage.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-6" alt="Anbernic RG477M promo banner render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nVK46NxPnCeAFZm4VY96mb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-4" alt="Anbernic RG477M bronze shell - angled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RNffGvaN4E7ZKVHPcJGAkb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb" name="anbernic-rg477m-teaser-video-screengrabs-5" alt="Anbernic RG477M silver/gunmetal close-up on left joystick" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QbCNu6FgSCu7rwZTfBeajb.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Anbernic)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One interesting tidbit to note is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anbernic.com/products/rgslide">Anbernic RG Slide</a> from June features a 4.7-inch IPS display, complete with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1280x960 resolution. It wouldn't come as any surprise if Anbernic ended up using the same panel from the RG Slide in the forthcoming RG477M.</p><p>That being said, we probably won't have to wait very long to learn more about what Anbernic has been working on. Once the initial teaser video is released, the company usually trickles out more information on a semi-rapid pace, leading up to pre-orders being made available. Given that retro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android handhelds</a> with metal shells don't come around very often, I'll be keeping a close eye on the launch of the RG477M.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Diving in supposedly provided the tipster with Google's early design of the feature. Reminiscent of At a Glance, Gemini Spaces will seemingly appear as a widget users can place on their home and lock screens.</p><p>Regarding the latter, the Gemini Spaces card will appear above your Pixel's lock screen clock if the larger numbers are used. If the smaller clock is chosen, the cards will appear right beneath it. The cards on the home screen seem relatively the same; however, the tipster offered a look at its Sports and Calendar event (birthday), which delivered a transparent background for the latter.</p><p>Another important detail is the dots right beneath Gemini Spaces cards.</p><p>These dots seem to indicate users can swipe through whatever Gemini has procured for the user. AssembleDebug was able to swipe from some sports scores to the calendar event, and it looks like there's room for more (if only Google had it working). The tipster adds that these cards should display finance information alongside what was already working early on. Considering Gemini's involvement, it's likely we'll see a whole host of topics/genres available in its new "Spaces" cards.</p><h2 id="gemini-becomes-integral-2">Gemini becomes integral</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-lock-screen-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google's "Gemini Spaces" redesign for At a Glance showing a birthday calendar event." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SZUbz5m4VKo44PMkJrU3NJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:266px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:225.56%;"><img id="SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ" name="google-gemini-spaces-at-a-glance-home-screen-leak" alt="A screenshot leak of a Pixel's home screen, showing sports scores, courtesy of Google's rumored "Gemini Spaces" feature." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SDf8W3Hdgk5PjVuZLZzFNJ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="266" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>In June, Google's development of "Gemini Spaces" was reported. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-give-at-a-glance-a-gemini-makeover-with-extra-smarts">early reports</a> claim the feature was similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's Now Bar</a>, a feature that delivers real-time information on whatever your interests are. It was originally reported to be a feature for your lock screen, but as we've now seen, it seems Google plans for this to be a true Gemini-fueled successor to At a Glance for your home screen, too.</p><p>The initial report was mostly code; however, that early code showed Gemini Spaces is aiming to "go beyond" what At a Glance can currently do: weather and calendar events. Only finance information and sports scores have been alleged, but it's not hard to imagine what else Gemini can pull for us. Perhaps sales on products we like or quick news blurbs.</p><p>What's more interesting is how much of Android Gemini is moving into. The AI has truly become a part of Google's vision <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-exec-android-gemini-future-os-interview-report">about the future of Android</a>, according to its president of Android Ecosystem, Sameer Samat. Not only is Google planning to merge ChromeOS with Android, but Gemini is taking center stage. Per Samat, Gemini has turned Android into a "helpful experience," which the company undoubtedly plans to evolve.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These featured notebooks already have everything you'd need available, as well as the option to generate an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">Audio Overview</a>. These topics, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/19bde485-a9c1-4809-8884-e872b2b67b44">Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>," have a mind map available to see how things connect.</p><p>Users retain the option to pose questions to the AI to get a little more understanding. However, if you're more interested in reading, you can certainly do that. Gemini's AI summary will be located at the top of those lengthy texts, just in case, too. NotebookLM's "featured notebooks" are rolling out today (July 14) for desktop computers.</p><h2 id="notebooklm-helps-streamline-learning-2">NotebookLM helps streamline learning</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUUZlcUgEis" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Users will also find these publicly available notebooks, courtesy of this new feature:</p><ul><li>Longevity advice from Eric Topol</li><li>A science fan’s guide to visiting Yellowstone National Park</li><li>An overview of long-term trends in human wellbeing, published by the University of Oxford-affiliated project, Our World In Data</li><li>Science-backed parenting advice from psychology professor Jacqueline Nesi</li><li>A notebook tracking the Q1 earnings reports from the top 50 public companies worldwide</li></ul><p>The feature currently rolling out for NotebookLM feels like an extension of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/public-notebooks-are-coming-to-notebooklm-for-easy-sharing-and-studying">Public Notebooks</a>, which debuted in June. Kind of like sharing a Google Doc, users can compile their latest notebook in the app and share a link with other users, so they can see and interact with it, too. Considering NotebookL:M is about studying and learning about topics in a way that doesn't feel so heavy, teachers and other educators may find this useful.</p><p>Topics that you need to teach or learn about take center stage without all the other fluff that doesn't matter. Moreover, your sources are clear, and if you need to scour the internet for them, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM would take care of it</a>.</p><p>Google rolled out Discover Sources in the app this spring, which takes away the necessity for users to search around manually for important sources. Now, users need only describe their topic and let NotebookLM look around and add in what's important. The AI will display what it found, leaving it in the user's hands to go through and check off which ones they want and don't want.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The device was reportedly spotted moving through the World Power Consortium (WPC) for certification purposes. There, the Qi2 wireless standard was noted; however, the listing failed to detail its charging strength. The flagship Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-fast-samsung-galaxy-s25-charging-speed">boasts 15W wireless support</a>, so <em>maybe </em>we're looking at that here, too.</p><p>Samsung's flagship Galaxy S25 series is also where it seems to want to bring its Galaxy S25 FE closer to—charging-wise, that is.

While it might also see two-year-old Samsung tech—the Exynos 1380 SoC—a report claimed the company had started testing it with One UI 7. It suggests the device has "progressed" in its development cycle, as rumors purport a fall launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">main Galaxy Tab S11 lineup</a>.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The goal was simple: build a website using Gemini detailing the history of Android.</p><p>Since then, we've been a little busy around these parts, so the project was slightly delayed. I was determined to come up with a (mostly) final result, but wasn't really a fan of the site design that I shared before.</p><p>As a result, I basically started over, firing up Google AI Studio and using a combination of prompts and my own knowledge to reach the goal. So, without further ado, I introduce you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://androidrewind.com/">AndroidRewind.com</a>.</p><h2 id="android-rewind-2">Android Rewind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c" name="android-rewind-home-page-screenshot" alt="Android Rewind home page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NFjPeACJRmYqqz2RQsoe6c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3896" height="2191" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Funnily enough, Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand recently published his own "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/the-evolution-of-android-decades-of-transformation">ode to Android</a>," providing snapshots of history since Google acquired Android Inc. back in July 2005. I implore you to check that out before anything else, as you'll get a Jerry-infused history lesson, and there's really nothing better than that.</p><p>As for Android Rewind, I wanted to provide digestible snippets about Android over the years. So you'll find the following landing pages:</p><ul><li><strong>Releases - A timeline of every major version of Android:</strong> Each entry shows the Codename, Release month/year, and Key Features.</li><li><strong>Devices - The hardware that defined generations of Android: </strong>Clicking a device will pull up the full name, OEM, release month/year, and a brief description.</li><li><strong>OEMs - The companies that build the hardware for the Android ecosystem: </strong>Select a company to view the name, primary location, and a bit about each company's impact.</li><li><strong>Notable Figures - The architects and visionaries behind Android: </strong>This one's pretty self-explanatory.</li></ul><p>Initially, the home page was nothing more than the header and a block of text at the top, along with the boxes at the bottom. But that was a bit too bland and boring for my taste, so I prompted Gemini to add a background image to the header section. More importantly, there's also the "Recent Release History," which is just an overview of the last five Android versions.</p><p>Almost all of the images you see on the site were sourced from the Android Central archives. With the exceptions being on the Figures page and images for the very early days of Android releases. Oh, right, and the actual website logo, which I asked Gemini to create and then tweaked to get what you see.</p><h2 id="lean-on-gemini-or-do-it-yourself-2">Lean on Gemini, or do it yourself</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3924px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c" name="android-rewind-code-assistant-file-tree-preview" alt="Code Assistant with Files and Preview in Google AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3bAgZVNZbZgEcydFETvw2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3924" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since basically this entire website is built using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>, that means there's no "backend" or CMS for me to interact with. So after I managed to get most of the pieces in place, I realized I needed a way to edit the content on the page.</p><p>Following the path of least resistance, I just asked Gemini to make certain elements editable. Then, I realized that all I really needed to do was edit the website code myself.</p><p>That kind of speaks to the versatility of working with Gemini, at least from the confines of Google AI Studio. Basically, if you want or need Gemini to do the legwork for you, it's right there. But if you want to take a more hands-on approach, that's also at your disposal.</p><h2 id="a-few-headaches-2">A few headaches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3931px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-deployment-revisions" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Deployment History" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cfbkpJWrGtmwQgamaBcr2c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3931" height="2211" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Gemini made all of this possible, not everything about building Android Rewind was smooth sailing. The most frustrating aspect was when I wanted to revisit the project at a later time, in order to make changes before the final push.</p><p>It turns out that even after connecting the created app to Google Cloud Run for deployment, there are a couple of ways that I lost progress. The first was actually clicking the "Deploy" button, which results in a pop-up that says the project was "successfully deployed to Google Cloud."</p><p>This is technically true, but it turns out that you have to click the "Redeploy app" if you make any changes to the code. There were a few times in the beginning when I would make changes and hit deploy, thinking that what appeared in the Preview window would be what showed up on the deployed site. That wasn't the case, so I ended up losing a few hours' worth of changes and manual tweaks.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3120px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb" name="android-rewind-google-cloud-project-deployment-message" alt="Android Rewind Google Cloud Project Deployment from AI Studio" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/feePwDWyFAMZLb6avr5Cvb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3120" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The other frustration I ran into is trying to edit the code after it's been deployed. One might think that you would be able to just come back to the same project in AI Studio later and pick up right where you left off.</p><p>Unless there's something I'm missing, that's not the case. So I had to dig through the Google Cloud Console to find the site code. After downloading the ZIP file, I opened up the initial project in AI Studio, then copied and pasted all of the contents into the specific files, and created new ones where necessary.</p><p>This is something that both Claude and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a> excel at, as I can close a window and pick right back up where I left off by selecting the pertinent "conversation." Hell, I can even upload an entire ZIP file to either of those and have it make edits for me, while AI Studio only lets me upload individual files and not entire projects.</p><h2 id="looking-to-the-future-2">Looking to the future</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3884px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c" name="android-rewind-android-release-details" alt="Android Rewind Release window" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AzMrjDtjwDZEaJPxcSvD3c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3884" height="2184" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm pretty happy with the current state of Android Rewind, at least for now. I'm sure that others will tell me about things that are missing, but I'm also going to eventually add more information where it makes sense.</p><p>First, I will add more details to each Android Release and Device entry. I've also toyed around with the idea of having dedicated OEM pages, providing a list of every major device release. Admittedly, I did think about having a full device history, but then I remembered just how many devices Samsung releases any given year, which quickly changed my mind.</p><p>More importantly, I will soon be adding devices like tablets, wearables, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a> to the mix. These are all just as important to the history of Android as phones, but for the sake of getting the site launched, I decided to omit them for now.</p><p>Be sure to keep an eye on Android Rewind, as the changes will (hopefully) come swiftly, and with Gemini at my side.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It builds on the original Balance with new features, including HYROX training, scuba support, and a brighter sapphire-glass display. Battery life remains a highlight, easily lasting up to two weeks in everyday use. While it's heavier than past models, it still looks sharp enough to wear all day.</p><p>The Amazfit Balance 2 pushes even closer to Wear OS territory, offering features such as Bluetooth calling through its built-in speaker and microphone. It also supports smart replies with a full QWERTY keyboard, making it easier to respond on the go. You'll find a solid mix of built-in apps, NFC for payments via Zepp Pay. The large 1.5-inch AMOLED display is bright enough for Outdoor use, and the upgraded sapphire glass and aluminum frame give the watch a premium, durable feel.</p><p>That said, the Balance 2 isn't without its drawbacks. Zepp OS also lacks the flexibility and app ecosystem of Wear OS, and message replies, while supported, can occasionally lag or fail to send.

You can choose from a range of colors, including black, charcoal, stone, and red.</p><p>The 14-day battery life is comparable to that of some of the more expensive Amazfit watches on this list, which is impressive. When you compare that to competitors that last for a day or two, this is a great accomplishment. The Amazfit Bip 6 offers over 140 sports modes, including popular options like outdoor running, strength training, and cycling. You'll also find more specialized activities, such as HYROX racing, yoga, and high-intensity interval training, providing fitness enthusiasts with a wide range of options.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-under-100"><span>Best under $100</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2587px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE" name="Amazfit-active-2" alt="Amazfit Active 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/keaEodb2MAR2ugvAA5t9YE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2587" height="1455" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazfit)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-amazfit-active-2-2"><span class="title__text">3.

The polycarbonate watch body is available in two unique colors: Desert Black and Sahara. The 1.3-inch AMOLED display has a touchscreen for easy navigation and four side buttons that you can use to navigate the watch if that's your preferred method. The best thing about this design is that it's tough and ideal for outdoor enthusiasts since it has military-grade durability. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra is easily one of the toughest watches, as it has passed 15 military-grade tests instead of 12 on the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazfit-t-rex-review">Amazfit T-Rex</a>.</p><p>No matter how long you plan to be outdoors, this is also one of the best Amazfit smartwatches for extended battery life. You can expect this beast to last up to 20 days with typical use. Those who use their smartwatch heavily can expect an average of around 12 days. In continuous GPS mode, the battery will last for 28 hours, and you can get as much as 80 hours from the endurance GPS mode. You also get an incredible water resistance rating. The Amazfit T-Rex Ultra can handle a depth of up to 100 meters, also known as 10 ATM water resistance.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, most users will be happy with the Amazfit T-Rex Ultra's health and activity features. You'll have over 160 sports modes, including outdoor cycling, treadmill, trail running, and walking. You can also record specific activities like hiking, climbing, hunting, and more. During a workout, you can also track your route with the built-in advanced GPS. There's also heart-rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and blood oxygen monitoring.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-for-runners"><span>Best for runners</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hM2khnFVp7iFFocYrpDnYU" name="Amazfit-Cheetah-Pro-elevation.jpeg" alt="Elevation widget on the Amazfit Cheetah Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hM2khnFVp7iFFocYrpDnYU.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-amazfit-cheetah-pro-2"><span class="title__text">5.

This model offers better GPS features than most smartwatches, with the GPS antenna able to pick up 100% of satellite signals instead of the 50% that most watches can manage. As a result, the Cheetah Pro will let you track your route far more accurately than other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running smartwatches</a> on the market.</p><p>Its slew of features includes 24-hour monitoring of various metrics and multiple triathlete modes. These features make it well worth the price tag, along with over 100 apps and multiple face options to tailor the watch to suit your needs.</p><p>There are arguably <em>too</em> many features here, though, with hidden menus and an overwhelming number of options that don't work as well as they should. This suggests that Amazfit could have benefitted from a little more streamlining rather than going the route of "jack of all trades, master of none."</p><p>However, while running, the watch comes into its own, boasting an impressive 14-hour battery life and a super lightweight design. The price tag is competitive, too, with the number of features justifying a purchase for serious runners.</p><p>The touchscreen is bright and impressive, but it is a little inconsistent during use. Overall, though, the Cheetah Pro is impressive, but it is a little more niche than other offerings on this list.

It's a more premium version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-gtr-mini-review" target="_blank">GTR Mini</a>, but with the price increase comes improved features. Battery life is clearly the standout feature here, as the Balance easily lasted for two weeks on average during our testing. The Amazfit is lightweight and stylish, a great combination that makes you want to wear it constantly.</p><p>The Balance comes close to offering Google Wear OS-like functionality, thanks to its ability to handle incoming calls via the built-in speaker and mic. You can also correctly reply to messages with the full QWERTY keyboard. You get a good selection of apps, NFC for payments (only via the Zepp Pay app), and support for the Alexa voice assistant. The Amazfit Balance also features a large and bright AMOLED display suitable for outdoor use, and its build quality is top-notch.</p><p>However, there are a couple of downsides, like the inconsistent pedometer, which puts it on the no-go list for serious athletes. The OS is also less capable than Wear OS, and message replies tend to hang. Lastly, there's no LTE option, which is a bit of a bummer.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-most-powerful"><span>Most powerful</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ck2SAasqYChQzGxVjDfy5i" name="Amazfit-Falcon-lifestyle-16x9-04.jpg" alt="Amazfit Falcon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ck2SAasqYChQzGxVjDfy5i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="7-amazfit-falcon-2"><span class="title__text">7.

The Amazfit Falcon is one such watch, offering a comprehensive range of health and fitness features. We went <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit-falcon-hands-on">hands-on with the Falcon</a> and were impressed with its high-grade titanium chassis and superb battery life.</p><p>The Amazfit Falcon is military-grade resistant to nature's elements, allowing you to participate in any rigorous outdoor activity easily. It uses Zepp OS 3.0, which comes with a ton of advanced features for working out, over 150 sports modes, and health monitoring such as blood oxygen levels and heart rate. The smartwatch has an AI coach to help you achieve your fitness goals.</p><p>The Amazfit Falcon can be expensive, but it could be the watch for you if you're a sports professional or military personnel. It has a touchscreen, but you can also navigate the wearable using the two side buttons.</p><p>Amazfit went the extra mile with the Falcon, which is why it has the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazfit.com/blogs/news/amazfit-creates-the-worlds-first-chatgpt-empowered-watch-face">world's first watch face coded by ChatGPT</a>. This doesn't make up for the lack of third-party apps, but seeing an Amazfit smartwatch one-up its competitors, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on" target="_blank">Pixel Watch 3,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-hands-on" target="_blank"> is nice</a>. Samsung and Google's wearables must rely on a roundabout way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-put-chatgpt-on-galaxy-watch-pixel-watch-wear-os">get ChatGPT on Wear OS</a>.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><p>With so many fantastic watches, how <em>do </em>you choose the right one? As with any smartwatch, you first ask yourself why you're getting it. Is it to keep track of steps, specific sports or activities, or get a good handle on your overall health and wellness? Then consider what else you want to do with it. Do you need access to third-party apps? Would you like to load music directly onto your watch? Do you want to read notifications and answer calls or texts directly from your wrist?</p><p>Create a list of features you want the watch to have, as well as the ones you need. Then, run through this list and eliminate or highlight models one by one. Soon, you'll be left with one or two models to choose from. From there, it might come down to price and design: Which one fits better on your wrist, suits your lifestyle, and is more affordable for your pocketbook?</p><p>The good news is that Amazfit has a smartwatch for just about everybody. When you focus on fitness, fashion, or both, you can find a model with everything you need. However, if you're looking for the absolute best Amazfit smartwatch, we highly recommend the Balance. It features a sleek design with fitness tracking capabilities, ensuring exceptional battery life.</p><p>To recap, the Amazfit Balance is equipped with over 150 sport modes, built-in GPS, sleep tracking, heart-rate monitoring, blood oxygen tracking, Amazon Alexa integration, and a microphone and speaker, allowing you to answer calls. It's not the type of watch that you'll have to charge every night, either. With average use, you might only need to charge it once a week.</p><p>Regardless of your preferences, you can likely find an Amazfit smartwatch that meets them. Whether you're a professional athlete looking to track your workouts and improve endurance, a runner training for the next big 5K, or a first-time user just getting started in the smartwatch world, there's bound to be a fitness-focused wearable from Amazfit that's perfect for you.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-we-test"><span>How we test</span></h3><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Why you can trust Android Central</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">☑️ One of the <strong>oldest and most trusted</strong> Android sites on the web<br>☑️ Over <strong>15 years</strong> of product testing<br>☑️ <strong>Thousands </strong>of products reviewed and tested since 2007<br>☑️ <strong>Dozens </strong>of smartwatches tested every year by our team</p></div></div><p>Testing smartwatches at Android Central involves much more than strapping them to our arms and taking a few pictures. Android Central Senior Editor Michael Hicks runs a weekly column called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">Sunday Runday</a>, where he discusses how smartwatches and exercise can help improve your life and promote health. Other smartwatch reviewers on the team, like Managing Editor Derrek Lee and Senior Editor Nicholas Sutrich, take numerous watches to the gym and competitions, putting them to the test exactly as you might.</p><p>In addition to comparing various watches during workouts, we wear each one to bed to evaluate sleep tracking and take them on long walks to test step accuracy. These everyday routines help us judge comfort, durability, and battery life over time. Therefore, when we recommend a smartwatch, it's because we've thoroughly tested it in real-world conditions and have the data to back it up.</p><p>Then there's the watch's operating system itself. Like Amazfit's smartwatches, many watches use proprietary operating systems that are compatible with Android and iOS devices. However, that can sometimes mean they aren't as full-featured as the OS made by Apple or Google. We take these things into account and ensure that you understand what might be missing from the experience on these watches, because, often, they excel in areas where watches from Google or Apple fall short.</p><p>Of course, all this affects how long a smartwatch's battery lasts. More features can sometimes mean worse battery life, but watches from brands like Amazfit or Garmin aim to help you stay healthier without requiring daily battery charging. We wear our watches for weeks or months to ensure accurate data and testing, so you can expect our battery life estimates to be exact.</p> ]]></dc:content>
