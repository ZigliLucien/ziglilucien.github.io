<h2 id="here-s-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-s-battery-life-2">Here's what you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life</h2>
<p>After months of anticipation and wait, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung's Galaxy S25 line-up</a> is finally here. As has been the case for the last few years, the family is comprised of three cutting-edge flagship smartphones. The base model—the Galaxy S25—packs everything from top-of-the-line hardware to an incredible triple-lens primary camera setup, all while being compact enough for one-handed use.</p><p>If you were to compare the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S24</a>, you'd see that the new model doesn't look all that different from its predecessor. Yes, you do get the latest in terms of hardware, lots of AI-powered tools, years of software updates, and more. But even though the phone is a little lighter than the previous-gen model, it still manages to pack in a 4,000mAh battery.</p><p>The same goes for the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>, which both have the same battery capacity as their predecessors. While that's good, the question is, what kind of battery life can be expected from the Galaxy S25 series?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-camera-viewfinder-01" alt="The camera viewfinder on a Samsung Galaxy S25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/42zoFP7EDYb3bxqECmZK7U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung says that "the Galaxy S25's battery usage time is enhanced for you to enjoy watching hours of videos, all thanks to a custom-made AP (Application Processor) and software optimization." While this claim doesn't really tell us that much, we have good news. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">reviewing the Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Android Central's Brady Snyder found the compact flagship to be more than capable of going on all day, that too with mixed-use involving everything from video streaming to taking calls. Unless you're a very heavy user, you can expect up to six hours of screen-on time and up to ten hours of screen-off time.</p><p>This is in line with the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra, which can last roughly a full day on a single charge with anywhere between six to eight hours of screen-on time in our use.</p><p>We know that the Galaxy S25 series is driven by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, a custom version of Qualcomm's newest flagship chipset. Among other improvements, the SoC helps with the device's overall energy efficiency. In addition, the inclusion of a larger vapor chamber should also allow for better-sustained performance (especially while gaming) without having an impact on battery life.</p><p>There's no denying that the Samsung Galaxy S25 is very much going to end up being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> out there, even more so for those who like pocketable devices. It has a premium design, blazing-fast performance, and more AI-based tricks than you can shake a stick it. Combine that with years of software support and solid battery life, and you get a top-tier Android phone that you shouldn't ignore.</p>

In a community blog post on their foldable strategy, Vale G, a OnePlus product manager, said the company is 'recalibrating their foldable strategy' and confirmed that it will be holding off on launching a OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year," the community post explained.</p><p>Since OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, the two share combined hardware and research teams, as well as a common software codebase. It looks like the focus is now fully on launching the world's thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">OPPO Find N5</a>, in the next couple of weeks. That said, OpenPlus doesn't fully rule out the possibility of launching Open 2 in the future.</p><p>"While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category," the community post added.</p>

<p>While the OnePlus Open 2 won't make an appearance this year, the company's next wearable will still launch as scheduled. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-detailed-ahead-of-launch" target="_blank">revealed</a> the first full look of its OnePlus Watch 3, which will launch on February 18 in the US, Canada, and European markets.</p><p>In a detailed press release, the OnePlus claims that this new watch is set to blend in with the user's daily needs with a "classic, premium, and durable design."  That said, the company is going full throttle on its "Never Settle" mantra by offering the Watch 3 with a whopping 16-day battery life on power saver mode and a prolonged 120 hours of battery on Smart mode. This is a bump from the 100-hour limit on its predecessor.</p>

The original poster displayed the "limitless" possibilities of the refreshed module in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, which showcased apps and folder placement. Pinching inward on their display brought up the usual home screen editing options but with a newly added "DIY Home" button.</p><p>What's more, is that tapping on the icon gives users complete freedom over the size and orientation of an app widget or folder. With this, you could basically place any app icon anywhere you'd like on the home screen without following the rules of the usual grid. The user is also able to overlap widgets and apps for a truly chaotic home screen. The demo only shows these changes applying to the apps above the bottom toolbar like messaging, phone calls, contacts, or anything else. Additionally, tapping a folder that's been rotated or upside down will open apps in it as normal.</p><p>People enrolled in the beta program can give these customizations a go. However, the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">reportedly pushing back the stable rollout</a> of this OS on the Galaxy S24 due to a display coloring issue.

According to Mark Gurman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, TikTok was first spotted on the Apple App Store. Several other users took to X, stating that the app had on Feb. 12. It looks like the app was being made available in phases and rolled out to most users today Feb.14.</p><p>Additionally, the publication reports that the app has reappeared on the Google Play Store. Android Central has also spotted TikTok's availability via the Play Store, so users who may have deleted the app or never had it can now download it.</p><p>While this may be good news for several avid TikTok-ers, Bloomberg states it has 75 days (from Jan 20) to find common ground with the U.S. government over privacy/security concerns. This looks like an interim solution while the company buys time to settle things with the present authorities.</p>

<p>Spotify premium subscribers had a frustrating experience this week. Despite paying $12 per month for an ad-free service, they ended up hearing commercial ads that disrupted their podcast or music. There were multiple reports of this issue on Spotify's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">community forums</a>, dating back to last Friday, Feb. 7. People were reporting issues and reaching out to support in multiple ways, with one user saying that it has been "impossible to talk to anyone at Spotify."</p><p>Only a week later, Spotify seemed to look into the issue. Spotify said, "Our tech teams are currently investigating reports of Premium users hearing ads. We'll keep you posted here if we have any news to share, so make sure to Subscribe to the thread to stay tuned."</p><p>Initially, the company asked users affected to add to the thread their device information, app version or web player, the type of ad they heard, and any troubleshooting steps they've already taken.</p><p>However, a few hours later, Spotify posted an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Ongoing-Issues/Premium-users-hearing-ads/idi-p/6698887" target="_blank">update</a> on its community forum confirming that the issue was the result of a bug and has since been fixed. "We have good news from our teams a fix for the instances where Premium users noticed ads when listening to music has been deployed and you should notice a difference right away," the company said. "It's worth keeping in mind, however, that it is expected that both free & Premium users may still see ads when listening to podcasts."</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I’ve reviewed more than a dozen Motorola phones over the past few years, most of which have been budget phones costing $400 or less. While I used to be very vocal about how Motorola just wasn't doing a good job making its low-end phones remotely useable, the company has come a long way in recent years, proving that users can still have a good experience without <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/penny-pinching-over-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-just-looks-bad">spending $1,300 for a phone</a>. And things are only going to get better for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>.</p><p>Last year, my top Android phone was the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>, which retailed for $999, and it's still my daily driver because I absolutely love the form factor. However, right before I got my hands on it, I reviewed the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a>, a phone that I was pretty sure I would forget almost as soon as I stopped using it. Instead, I didn't wanna put the phone down, even when I had to switch gears to the Razr.</p><p>The Stylus just felt like a flagship in a phone that cost half as much as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> would cost you today and with pretty comparable specs. It has a Full HD+ OLED display, a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, and a pretty capable 50MP primary camera. Not to mention, Motorola's signature vegan leather finish just looks and feels great.</p><p>Sure, performance may not match up to today's Snapdragon 8 Elite and all its AI flourishes, but the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-6-gen-1-snapdragon-4-gen-1-launch">mid-range Snapdragon chip</a> in the Stylus was no slouch either. Combined with great performance and a solid overall package, I would constantly forget that this is a mid-range phone. In fact, my mum wants a new phone, and I'm tempted to just get her the Stylus 5G 2024, as I wouldn't get her a phone that I myself wouldn't use.</p>

<p>We're just two months into 2025, and Motorola has already launched two phones in North America. On the surface, they don't seem like much, but they've managed to exceed our expectations about the kind of experience one can expect on a phone that costs $200. Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich found himself surprised at how much he liked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, especially when compared to his experience with its predecessor.</p><p>"Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-5g-2024-review">Moto G 5G 2024</a> was a pretty terrible phone, even for the low price, but Motorola has turned things around and addressed nearly every complaint I had without raising the price for this year's model," he states in his review. Sutrich highlights a bright, eye-friendly display, great design, and solid battery life as major selling points for the phone.</p><p>I had a similar experience with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>, which launched alongside the Moto G 2025. The design is a welcome improvement over its predecessor, especially with the improved durability and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating. It also handles gaming surprisingly well and comes equipped with wireless charging, which isn't very common at this price point.</p><p>That's not to say these phones are perfect. The MediaTek chip can feel sluggish the first time you do something new on the phone, but it seems to catch up in no time. Motorola also improved its software update promise to now include two OS upgrades, although that's still a far cry from what you'll get on Samsung phones, for example.</p><p>Still, for what you're paying for, these phones could be much worse than they are. Yet it seems like Motorola and other companies are upping the standards for cheap Android phones. Even this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-bad-can-this-100-nuu-phone-be">$100 phone from NUU</a> is able to provide users with a half-decent experience with <em>zero</em> bloatware, a 90Hz display, great battery life, and more.</p><p>This is great for people who don't need all the latest AI features or to spend $800+ on the best of the best. It's especially great for parents who want to buy their kids their first phone.</p><p>This was also something that OnePlus understood with its Nord N-series phones, which offered surprisingly good value. And after seeing what the company did with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, I can only imagine what a new Nord N phone would be like. If you're reading this, OnePlus, now would probably be a good time to introduce a new one.</p>

<p>This is only the beginning, and so far, I'm very excited about what's to come. After all, Motorola altered my expectations about cheap Android phones with last year's Stylus 5G 2024. Things can only go up from here as components get cheaper and better, and more capable chips trickle down to the lower end.</p><p>Qualcomm is already setting the stage for a new generation of midrange phones with more AI capabilities. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomms-new-snapdragon-chip-is-about-to-make-mid-range-phones-way-better">Snapdragon 6 Gen 4</a> is an upgraded version of the same chip used in last year's Stylus, and it promises better performance as well as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>, which is a first for the 6-series. This means we will start seeing more features normally reserved for flagship phones powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> on phones that cost half the price.</p><p>Qualcomm says Realme, OPPO, and Honor will be among the first to introduce phones with the new chip. There's no word on whether or not the next Moto G Stylus will sport the new Snapdragon 6 Gen 4, but I'm looking forward to whatever we get, regardless.</p><p>As someone who still loves high-end phones like the Razr and Galaxy S25 Plus, 2025 looks like a great year to start looking at cheaper phones, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-are-tariffs-going-to-make-my-next-phone-cost-more">threat of tariffs</a> looming over.</p>

<p>Comparing the Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2 is more complicated than you'd think. The Garmin Instinct 3 has both AMOLED and MIP Solar versions in multiple sizes, each with a different battery life. The Garmin Instinct 2 and smaller 2S each have solar and non-solar options, and there's an Instinct 2X that falls in the middle between these two generations.</p><p>All three watches are almost unparalleled for battery life — not counting the expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Garmin Fenix 8</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-launches-new-fenix-8-and-enduro-3">Enduro 3</a>. The Instinct 3 Solar gives you a 5X boost in solar efficiency over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2-solar-review">Instinct 2 Solar</a>, but the gap is smaller for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X Solar</a> owners. And even though the Instinct 3 AMOLED has no solar recharge, it may last longer or shorter than the Instinct 2 Solar depending on your lifestyle.</p><p>Now you're starting to see why this guide isn't so straightforward! But we'll break down every key difference in hardware, design, software features, and battery life across each version and generation, to help you decide whether to upgrade, stick with your current watch, or buy a last-gen model on sale for a low price.</p><p>Our previous guides on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-vs-instinct-2">Instinct vs. Instinct 2 guide</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-vs-2-solar">Instinct 2 Solar vs. 2X Solar</a> break down last-gen differences for background information.

<h2 id="a-brief-garmin-instinct-3-amoled-vs-solar-breakdown-2">A brief Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED vs. Solar breakdown</h2>
<p>Before I compare the Instinct 3 vs. Instinct 2, I want to highlight key differences between the four Instinct 3 watches.</p>

<p>As you can see, the two 45mm models are slightly lighter and thicker than their 50mm counterparts. Both AMOLED watches have the same pixels per inch, while the smaller Instinct 3 Solar has a petite screen with a higher PPI than the 50mm Solar. The larger and smaller watches use 26mm and 22mm bands, respectively, but they should all fit the same wrist sizes.</p><p>Either MIP display is much lower-resolution and monocolored, while the AMOLED watches provide a real visual upgrade. They also add perks like on-screen workout animations, always-on display, or images from notifications that the MIP watches can't offer. But neither AMOLED nor MIP Solar has a touchscreen.</p><p>In exchange for a worse visual experience, the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar has fantastic battery recharging capable of stretching standard GPS tracking to last for weeks at a time — longer than the Instinct 3 AMOLED might last with <em>no</em> GPS tracking. Both 45mm Instinct 3 watches have a noticeable dip in battery life compared to their 50mm counterparts; you can see the differences above.</p><p>For the following sections, I'll only include the 50mm Instinct 3 AMOLED and Solar when comparing against the last-gen watches, to make the comparison less cluttered and easier to parse.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2-design" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another, showing the different display types." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Q7nWLGNk6ukD7ce9ougNM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Let's start with the Garmin Instinct series' trademark perk: Epic battery life. While the Garmin Instinct 2 Solar offered "unlimited" battery life, that was only in the context of never using GPS, using Max Battery mode (one GPS check per minute), or using Expedition mode (one GPS check per hour with no sensors or accessories). The efficiency of the solar panel wasn't especially strong.</p><p>You can see how the Garmin Instinct 3 Solar panel adds 200 estimated GPS hours of tracking, based on whether or not you're spending at least three hours a day in sunny conditions. Compared to that, the Instinct 2X Solar's 85 extra hours are respectable but well short; the Instinct 2 Solar's 18 hours felt significant back in 2022 but barely feels like a blip now.</p><p>Where the Instinct 3 Solar especially shines is for multi-band GPS tracking. Because that mode is so power-hungry, the Instinct 2X Solar could only add a few extra hours before it died. The newest model can still double your efficiency while offering the best location data that Garmin has to offer.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X" name="IMG_9784" alt="A post-run heart rate graph showing the runner's average and max heart rate across a two-mile track workout, with most heart rates in zone 4 (orange) or zone 5 (red)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yd4SFRpcYEoCfQHnrU3h5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED barely belongs in the same conversation as these MIP watches, but it's not as deficient as you might think. Its 40 GPS hours beat the Instinct 2 Solar's 30-hour estimate, only losing if you spend enough time outdoors in ideal conditions to get the recharge. You can enjoy a much better display and GPS accuracy without having to worry about the weather or hiking in the shade.</p><p>Should you upgrade for better battery life? Garmin Instinct 2X Solar buyers probably shouldn't unless they find a trade-in deal and really need an extra 100+ hours of GPS battery; you're already getting "unlimited" Max Battery or Expedition mode, so an Instinct 3 upgrade only applies if you need literal days of per-second GPS tracking and don't have any means of charging your Instinct 2X Solar overnight.</p><p>But if you have an older Instinct 1 or 2, your new battery boost will be at a whole other level — or else you can choose the Instinct 3 AMOLED and still get comparable or better battery life.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-design-and-display-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Design and display</h2>

<p>The changes across the Garmin Instinct series for this latest generation are fairly subtle. The Instinct 2X Solar is slightly heavier, but otherwise they're about the same size and weight, have the same military-grade durability against thermal, shock, and water damage, connect to the same accessories, and measure the same health data like heart rate, HRV, and blood oxygen.</p><p>While everyday people might find the Instinct series ugly — the 2X Solar scored last place in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">smartwatch beauty pageant</a> — fans of sporty watches will appreciate its classic look. Garmin gave the Instinct 3 a bit more personality with an aluminum bezel around the display edge that looks striking, especially on the limited-edition models that add color contrast to the bulky, monocolor silicone.</p><p>Garmin has given the memory-in-pixel Solar Instincts the same 176 x 176 resolution over the last couple of generations. That said, Garmin upped the visual contrast on the Instinct 2X compared to the Instinct 2, making it more readable, and while I haven't tested the Instinct 3 Solar myself, I've heard that this version is even more readable despite having the same pixels.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-vs-2X-vs-2" alt="The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED, Instinct 2X Solar, and Instinct 2 Solar next to one another." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i8EnHBDhBGMWTUdpBYpBRM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All non-AMOLED Garmin Instincts have a second window that takes up visual real estate. Some Instinct 3 Solar buyers have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/01/31/garmin-instinct-3-solar-mini-display-off-centre/">complained about the data being misaligned within the circular space</a>, but it's hard to say how common these manufacturer defects are. The biggest issue is that this window — and the low resolution overall — prevent any possible maps, images, or full-screen graphs. Newer models are more readable, but none are fun to look at outside of workouts!</p><p>The Garmin Instinct 3 AMOLED has the same size and resolution as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-265-review">Garmin Forerunner 265</a>, though slightly smaller than the 1.4-inch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Venu 3</a>. What's more relevant is that this display is non-touch, so you'll still have to rely fully on the Up/ Down buttons to navigate, and there is no map navigation. Still, you can trust me when I say that this upgrade makes the Instinct 3 much easier to read indoors and enables colorful graphs that look dull and blurry on the Instinct 2 or 2X.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 2X added multi-band GPS over the GPS-only Instinct 2, matching the Instinct 3 for accuracy. The only difference is that the newer watch has SatIQ mode, which defaults to GPS alone unless the watch encounters signal interference and needs other GNSS or the L5 GPS frequency to pinpoint you. This saves hours of battery life but ensures better accuracy in tough conditions.</p><p>This mid-generation watch was also the first Instinct to add a built-in LED flashlight; the brightness is the same on the 2X and 3. It's good enough in a pinch but won't replace an <em>actual</em> flashlight or headlamp for night conditions. It burns through a healthy amount of battery, too, so the Instinct 3's more efficient solar panel might come in handy if you use it a lot.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-instinct-3-vs-2x-vs-2-software-2">Garmin Instinct 3 vs. 2X vs. 2: Software</h2>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 2 shipped with most of the best Garmin Forerunner training tools available at the time, providing enough health and training load to help you become fitter and improve your VO2 Max. The gap between the Garmin Instinct 3 and 2 software isn't especially wide, but the new watches have more memory, leaving room for new feature updates that the Instinct 2 series will miss out on — and also eliminating some of the noticeable lag on the last-gen watches.</p><p>For now, the table above bolds those features that the Instinct 3 has that the 2X and 2 don't.</p><p>For health data, the Instinct 3 can detect naps for enhanced Body Battery data and will provide sleep coaching in your Morning Report. Otherwise, the data is identical, since they all use the same Elevate v4 sensors.</p><p>For general smarts, the Instinct 3 Solar isn't that different, but the AMOLED version will display notification images and (during Garmin Strength Coaching) display visual muscle maps and workout animations. It also has a large font option that the MIP watches lack. Only the Instinct 3 allows family and friends to watch you during a live event, but all the watches have a general LiveTrack tool if you want them to keep an eye on your progress during outdoor excursions.</p>

<p>On the training front, serious athletes will appreciate having training load focus, which splits up your recent workouts into low/ high aerobic and anaerobic types so you know what types you need to focus on to improve, as well as your training load ratio comparing this week to past weeks.</p><p>If you want to do interval training, only the Instinct 3 shows a rest timer and has improved tools like auto-detected starts and open repeats. The same goes for auto-detecting when your multisport activity has switched to the next type, or for following PacePro guidance.</p><p>If you're a runner or cyclist who wants to analyze your form, the Instinct 3 has wrist-based running dynamics — the Instinct 2 and 2X required a separate pod — and cycling dynamics like Power Phase and right/left balance.</p><p>Lastly, Instinct 2 owners will get dozens of new sports modes on the Instinct 3 series: Indoor walking, virtual running, obstacle racing, golfing, disc golf, archery, cyclocross, BMX, water skiing, snorkeling, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, tubing, boating, whitewater, XC skate skiing, ice skating, pickleball, badminton, squash, table tennis, padel, platform tennis, racquetball, basketball, volleyball, field hockey, ice hockey, football/soccer, American football, lacrosse, rugby, ultimate disc, cricket, softball, baseball, boxing, mixed martial arts, motorcycling, overlanding, motocrossing, ATVing, and snowmobiling.</p><p>It's fair to say that most of these sports profiles won't apply to your lifestyle, but anyone with niche hobbies will find the Instinct 3 more helpful at tracking them.</p>

<p>The Garmin Instinct 3 is an undeniable step up on every other Instinct before it. If you're deciding between a full-priced Instinct 3 or a discounted Instinct 2, I think perks like the revamped solar charging or AMOLED, multi-band GPS, flashlight, and aluminum bezel make it worth spending full price.</p><p>But as I've previously written, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-cant-decide-if-the-garmin-instinct-3-is-a-triumph-or-a-letdown">criticize the Instinct 3 Solar</a> for how similar it is to the Instinct 2X aside from the boosted battery life. If you own the Garmin Instinct 2X, I would hold off on buying the Instinct 3, simply because you just spent $450 and you'll get diminished returns.</p><p>The Instinct 3 AMOLED is my preferred choice from a visual perspective, it doesn't have a trademark skill like the Solar watches' unlimited battery life. It's just a rugged, bulky Forerunner 265. If you can accept the lack of a flashy new perk, this is undoubtedly one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> available.</p><p>If you've owned an Instinct 1 or 2 for a couple of years, it's not a bad time to upgrade. Just make sure that you really need that extra Solar battery life, or that you can do without "unlimited" max-battery excursions for a better display.</p>

Yes, it was temporarily shut down in the U.S. following a short ban. But TikTok announced in mid-January 2025 that it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us">in the process of restoring service</a> and the TikTok app is now back up and running.</p><p>As you scroll, you can share a link to a video with someone on the fly using the Share button. But sometimes, there are ones you want to be able to keep locally on your device. This might be to share with others when you’ll be somewhere without a connection, like deep in the woods while camping (and wanting to practice the latest dance trend), while on a boat without a Wi-Fi or cellular connection, or even when traveling if you prefer to turn off data roaming. Maybe it’s just a favorite video you want to keep for posterity. It’s easy to download a TikTok video to watch offline, as long as the creator has not disabled the download option.</p>

<p>As noted, keep in mind that some creators disable the download option. If this is the case, you will not see the Save video option when you try to download it. If this option isn’t available, avoid trying to circumvent the rules and downloading the video through other means since the creator has not given permission for you to do so.</p><p>Even when you download a video, it will still have a TikTok watermark so the ownership of the video is known. Downloading it to watch at your leisure or share with friends while at the cabin without Wi-Fi is totally fine. Just remember never to pass off a downloaded video as your own or edit and re-post it in any manner without express permission from the content owner.</p><p>TikTok looks fabulous on all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a> and while the app can be addictive, it’s important to be mindful of how much time you spend on the app as well as what you watch. Downloading videos from the site will take up valuable space on your device as well, so don’t forget to delete them once you no longer want or need them.</p>

<p>After nearly six long years, Apple finally gave the Powerbeats Pro the refresh it deserves. Beats revealed the Powerbeats Pro 2 on February 11, 2025, following months of teasers featuring high-profile athletes and celebrities.</p><p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 gain many of the AirPods Pro 2's best features — including the H2 chip, ANC and transparency modes, Spatial Audio, and the ear tip fit test — plus an optical heart rate sensor for workouts and a more compact design. They also retain the original Powerbeats Pro's iconic ear hook for stability and its $250 retail price.</p><p>For people still rocking the original Powerbeats Pro years later, is it time to finally upgrade to the Powerbeats Pro 2? Or, is there any reason to get the Powerbeats Pro in 2025? After spending over five years running with the Powerbeats Pro, and testing the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> side-by-side with their predecessor for the past week, I'm ready to answer both questions.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-design-and-comfort-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Design and comfort</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-3" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Aj9TpQzrrgk8H3xrfWVaND.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Powerbeats Pro (top) above Powerbeats Pro 2 (bottom). </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the new Powerbeats Pro 2 beside the original Powerbeats Pro, it's clear they're both similar and a lot different. Beats kept the general idea of Powerbeats intact, with a housing shaped like a bar and an ear hook for stability. However, it's not the same hook as the Powerbeats Pro. Instead of the adjustable ear hook on the first-generation earbuds, which could be molded and retained shape, the Powerbeats Pro 2 have a flexible ear hook. It's half the size and will still keep your headphones from falling out.</p><p>Smaller is a theme for the Powerbeats Pro 2. The earbuds are smaller overall despite housing more technology inside. Is this a good thing? That depends. After a lot of testing, through walks, runs, and daily use, I can definitively say that I find the original Powerbeats Pro more secure and comfortable. The bigger size actually fills up my ear better, adding to the stable feel.</p><p>That isn't to say that Powerbeats Pro 2 aren't comfortable. They come with five ear tip sizes, from XS to XL, and support the ear tip fit test. This is a software tool that will let you know if you're using the right ear tip size in the Beats app for Android or the settings app for iOS. Paired with the ear hook, there was never a time I was worried about the Powerbeats Pro 2 falling out.</p>

<p>Comfort is subjective, but I'd estimate the Powerbeats Pro feel about 10% more comfortable than the Powerbeats Pro 2. It's not a dealbreaker, but something to consider.</p><p>To get the best experience, you also have to wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly. With the new design, the bar needs to be pointing sharply upward, with the ear hook following the natural shape of your ear lobe. This is a departure from how the original Powerbeats Pro fit; they sat closer to the horizontal plane in your ear. If you don't wear Powerbeats Pro 2 correctly, the heart rate sensor won't be able to get accurate readings.</p><p>Another great thing about the Powerbeats Pro 2 is that it's still equipped with tactile, physical buttons. Each earbuds has a volume rocker at the top and play/pause button on the Beats logo. Again, the play/pause button feels <em>slightly</em> better on the originals — it's bigger and more pronounced — but the difference isn't that big of a deal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z9CuZ3ZoAQTfCWZSb2z5yE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-9" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z9CuZ3ZoAQTfCWZSb2z5yE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is smaller than that of the originals, but it's still double the size of the AirPods Pro 2 charging case. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 charging case is a massive upgrade. It now supports USB-C wired charging and Qi wireless charging. Beyond that, it's smaller, and it's finally pocketable — though you will be left with a bulge and it's still not perfect. In the photo above, you'll see the difference between the Powerbeats Pro, Powerbeats Pro 2, and AirPods Pro 2 charging case.</p><p>The new shape of the earbuds makes putting them into the charging case right a bit trickier. However, in my experience, they snap into place perfectly once you find the right spot. This is a big deal, because the original Powerbeats Pro had finicky and sensitive charging contacts, and were notorious for not charging properly.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-hardware-and-sound-quality-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Hardware and sound quality</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-7" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5wfNzspPwM3T9cQCiKMWBD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 refresh is important because, unlike the AirPods Pro/AirPods Pro 2 refresh, the Powerbeats have design <em>and</em> hardware improvements. In fact, just like the Powerbeats Pro and AirPods Pro before it, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are very similar to the AirPods Pro 2 in terms of hardware. Both have an H2 chip for fast-pairing and low-latency connection for Apple products — including ultra-low-latency for Apple Vision Pro. Powerbeats Pro 2 also support one-touch pairing on Android, which the AirPods Pro 2 don't support.</p><p>Powerbeats Pro 2 add support for the ear tip fit test, Spatial Audio, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-active-noise-cancellation-and-how-does-it-work-headphones">active noise-canceling (ANC)</a>, transparency mode, and voice isolation — all of which the original Powerbeats Pro does not support. Voice isolation will help clean up input from the Powerbeats Pro 2's six microphones (compared to the Powerbeats Pro's two), but is only available on iOS. As such, Android users will get a bit worse microphone quality than Apple users.</p><p>In terms of audio hardware, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are now equipped with a venting channel to avoid pressure, a high-output amplifier, and axial-aligned transducers. The latter simply means that the transducers are parallel to the acoustic nozzle, which means the sound will go straight into your ear without changing direction. In simple terms, the Powerbeats Pro 2 should sound better than the originals.</p>

<p>In the real world, though, the difference wasn't nearly as noticeable as it might sound. Both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and original Powerbeats Pro could handle music of all genres, with a slight preference to low-frequency sounds. Yes, that means Powerbeats Pro 2 sound excellent while listening to hip-hop/rap/R&B tracks from artists like the Wu-Tang Clan and SZA, but it also means they'll excel at jazz pieces from groups like Booker T. & the M.G.'s.</p><p>You won't want to upgrade from the Powerbeats Pro to the Powerbeats Pro 2 for sound quality alone. The huge differential just isn't there. However, you may want to upgrade for Spatial Audio, ANC, and transparency modes. ANC modes on the Powerbeats Pro feel equivalent to AirPods Pro 2 in terms of their capabilities, which is a huge compliment. I can block out just about any sound I need to, and let it in when necessary.</p><p>Transparency mode will be a game-changer for runners and cyclists. As a long-distance runner who likes to work out outdoors, I rarely wear both Powerbeats Pro earbuds. It just isn't safe. I need to hear cars, bikes, and generally be aware of my surroundings. With Powerbeats Pro 2, I can do that while wearing both earbuds.</p><p>Of course, we can't forget the optical heart rate sensor inside the Powerbeats Pro 2, which are the earbuds' headlining feature. It's essentially a miniature version of the optical sensor inside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-never-expected-to-love-apple-watch-ultra-2-so-much">Apple Watch</a>, and compiles readings from each earbud to create a measurement. It records a reading every five seconds, and is comparable to high-end fitness watches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-ditched-my-apple-and-galaxy-watches-for-a-garmin-and-you-should-too">Garmin Enduro 3</a> in my testing.</p><p>Heart rate monitoring (HRM) is arguably better on Android than iOS, because it's easier to manually control via the Beats app. It works with almost any device that supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors, including smartwatches. Is it a must-have feature?</p><p>Maybe, maybe not. I won't replace a dedicated fitness watch for Powerbeats Pro 2 anytime soon, but I could see why someone might. For example, certain activities — like weightlifting, core workouts, and yoga — can be difficult with a wearable on the wrist.</p>
<h2 id="powerbeats-pro-2-vs-powerbeats-pro-battery-life-2">Powerbeats Pro 2 vs. Powerbeats Pro: Battery life</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE" name="Powerbeats-Pro-2-vs-Powerbeats-2" alt="The orange Powerbeats Pro 2 next to the Navy original Powerbeats Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cyd6yTNNqLifPvgwWhGYEE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Apple improved the battery life of the Powerbeats Pro 2, which helps offset any hit that HRM or ANC would've had. The original Powerbeats Pro could get 9 hours of playback on a single charge, plus an additional 15 hours via the charging case. Meanwhile, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can get up to eight hours of playback on a single charge with an ANC mode active, plus an additional 28 hours via the charging case. With Adaptive EQ enabled, the Powerbeats Pro 2 can reach their maximum battery life of 45 hours including the case.</p><p>A quick five-minute charge gives you 1.5 hours of playback on both the Powerbeats Pro 2 and the originals. The Powerbeats Pro 2 charge from 0% to 100% in two hours.</p>

<p>Powerbeats have existed for 15 years now, and went through multiple iterations since they debuted in 2010. Powerbeats Pro 2 are very good workout headphones, but they are a slight departure from the familiar and consistent Powerbeats design and fit. As a result, I'm still fond of the Powerbeats Pro and would consider still using them for certain where perfect fit and stability is absolutely necessary.</p><p>Overall, the Powerbeats Pro 2 show why change is also necessary. The Powerbeats Pro had glaring flaws, from the charging case to the lack of ANC and transparency mode, and the Powerbeats Pro 2 seemingly fixed them all. It's hard to be disappointed when Powerbeats Pro fans got exactly what they wanted. And even if the Powerbeats Pro 2 are slightly less comfortable than their predecessor, they're still ahead of the competition by miles.</p><p>If you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">best pair of workout earbuds today</a>, it's probably the Powerbeats Pro 2. They sound excellent, are comfortable, support ANC and transparency mode, and work well with iOS and Android. At $250, I'm absolutely willing to recommend these headphones — especially considering my first-generation pair is still in use after five years.</p><p>But let me tell you this: if you can live with Lightning charging and a bulky case, the original Powerbeats Pro are still a sneaky value buy at their new price of just over $100.</p>

You shouldn't be surprised about this. Disappointed, maybe, but not surprised.</p><p>This highlights something most people aren't thinking about — a company can support a phone for seven years, but it can't make newer features work on older hardware every time. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-how-many-updates">Seven years of updates</a> doesn't really mean what you think it means.</p>

<p>This is not a bad thing, even if it feels like a bad thing. Samsung explains that many of the AI features depend on what Samsung calls the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a> and that engine isn't supported on older chips; it needs the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> in order to work properly.</p><p>We'll see more of this as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-agentic-ai">Agentic, or "thinking" AI</a> features, are developed, and you should expect to see some features on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> that will not come to the S25. And that's OK.</p>

<p>You should not buy a phone because you expect something in the future. A phone should do everything it is advertised to do, be mostly bug-free, and be supported to do those things as long as possible. Having seven years of support means your phone will probably <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-shows-easily-removable-battery">outlast your battery</a>.</p><p>This isn't a Samsung thing. It's not even an Android thing. We're seeing the exact same from Google with the Pixel series and there will be multiple features that can't be used on the older hardware. The iPhone is the same, with iOS features becoming more hardware-dependent as AI is further integrated into the operating system.</p>

<p>I love this. You might not, and we can disagree, but knowing that a phone I buy in 2025 will still be supported and perform as expected in 2030 is excellent. I do not expect any new features and the ones that are developed are a bonus. Hopefully, any new features work as they should.</p><p>Phones are at a point where hardware is only a limiting factor when companies leverage those small incremental features they bring. Even more so when a company develops its own chip — either a full SoC package or custom coprocessors — that have a specific use.</p><p>Apple is a great example — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-15-vs-iphone-15-plus-vs-iphone-15-pro-vs-iphone-15-pro-max">A16 Bionic</a> inside the iPhone 15 is as powerful as the chip that powers a typical laptop. It should be able to handle anything iOS has to offer. It's limited when it comes to AI because Apple dedicated parts of the newer chip to perform these functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB" name="Snapdrag-8-elite" alt="Shot of the stage from Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bScw4JoPDKnTFhQdgfAWGB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Snapdragon or Tensor chip isn't nearly as powerful when it comes to raw processing, but they are more than a CPU, and parts of the chipset are doing very specific things. These parts just aren't inside older phones.</p><p>Forcing new features to work with "inferior" hardware would only make the features worse. Engineers love to develop new stuff and want everyone to use it, and phone makers love to lock new features behind the purchase of a new phone, but the reality is that sometimes there are real reasons why an older model can't do what it needs to do.</p><p>What's really important is that phone manufacturers are beginning to realize (or care) that we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/buying-new-phone-every-year-kind-crazy">don't need to buy a new phone every year</a> or even every two years. Some of us don't want to. I doubt very many people will use the same phone for seven years — even I would upgrade before then — but knowing that you could is awesome.</p><p>Now, we just need every phone maker to get on board and provide customer service as long as Samsung, Google, and Apple do, even if it means some of the new flashy stuff won't be included.</p>

At $299, it's by no means a flagship phone, so I knew very well what I was getting myself into. But while I have plenty of experience with flagships, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> I just reviewed, I always enjoy seeing how phones on the lower end improve.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 is a middle-of-the-road phone for Motorola that leans toward the low-end. That's something to keep in mind when looking at a phone priced just under $300. There's nothing particularly groundbreaking about it, but it <em>does</em> come with a few surprises that we wouldn't have expected to see on such an affordable phone.</p>

The phone will also be sold through carriers, including T-Mobile, Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket, AT&T, Straight Talk, Total Wireless, Verizon, UScellular, and Consumer Cellular.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 will be available starting at $299, although pricing may vary depending on the retailer or carrier.</p><p>The phone will only come in two colorways: Leaf Green and Slate Gray.

<p>For years, Motorola's phones have had very basic designs, especially the budget Moto G series. The company has been switching that up in recent years, borrowing design cues from its higher-end Edge series like a seamless camera housing and vegan leather finishes. The Moto G Power 2025 is possibly the best-looking Moto G phone I've reviewed, in many ways looking more like a flagship than a $300 phone.</p><p>The phone only comes in two colors but the standout is the Leaf Green (not to be confused with the 2004 Pokémon game of the same name). It's incredibly vibrant, and the soft vegan leather is contrasted by the glossy camera rings, which add a nice flair. The frame of the phone also matches the color and sports a brushed finish. Fingerprints are pretty much non-existent on this phone.</p>

<p>But it's not just good looks that make this phone stand out; it's the build quality. The Moto G Power 2025 is one of the cheapest phones to sport an IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> water and dust resistance rating. It may not seem like a huge deal, but this will ensure that the phone can not only handle being submerged but can also withstand high-pressure jets of water. Has anyone ever had their phone accidentally fall into a dishwasher right before they started a cycle? No? Just me? Well, now, that's one less thing you have to worry about.</p><p>I'm not brave enough to test this out myself, but Android Central Phones editor Nick Sutrich did just that with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, and it came out unscathed. I'll take his word for it.</p><p>The MIL-STD-810H certification is also a plus, especially since I've recently taken up skiing and tend to keep my phone in my pocket despite still being quite a novice on the slopes.</p>

<p>Motorola sticks with a Full HD+ LCD panel for the Moto G Power 2025, which is plenty bright and responsive thanks to the 120Hz refresh rate. Despite not being the brightest at 1000 nits, I haven't had any trouble viewing the display in any lighting conditions. The bezels are also pretty minimal despite the larger chin and <em>slightly</em> larger forehead.</p><p>The high refresh rate helps make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> feel very smooth when scrolling through apps and pages. There aren't any significant changes with Motorola's version of Android 15 since shifting its software to the new Hello UX with Android 14. It's a fairly clean and simple flavor of Android that doesn't feature too many extra flourishes, although it's dotted here and there with some of Motorola's fixins, like the new dual-panel Control Center/notification pane that more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are adopting.</p><p>Motorola also retains its useful gestures, which continue to be a favorite of mine. Chopping the phone twice turns on the flashlight, twisting twice enables the camera, and a double tap on the back can open apps or perform certain actions. I also love the Sidebar, which can be used to house your frequently used apps, and I think every OEM should have something like this (looking at you, Google).</p>

<p>Performance isn't as big of an issue as one might think. I haven't noticed many problems in this area, but it's important to manage your expectations to some extent. For instance, I can't get away with playing Honkai: Star Rail on its highest settings unless I wanna struggle through poor frame rates and barely functional gameplay. But the phone can surprisingly manage the game at visual settings set to "High" and at 60fps, which is honestly still a great way to play the game.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You'll also be happy to know that battery life is quite good. While I would like to see a 6,000mAh battery on the phone with "Power" in the name, the 5,000mAh capacity still gets the phone through a full day of regular use without issue. It's helped by 30W wired charging, which is still faster than the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, and 15W wireless charging is a nice thing to have, even if it's not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2</a>.</p><p>Motorola is also doing a better job with its software promise. Previously, the company would offer one OS upgrade with three years of software updates. In 2025, the company is upping that for its budget phones with one additional OS upgrade, meaning the Moto G Power 2025 will support Android 17 when it launches, giving this $300 even more value.</p>

<p>While I mostly enjoy Motorola's flavor of Android, the downside of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> like this is that you're likely to find some level of bloatware. There are quite a few apps preinstalled that I don't want and wasn't given an option to opt out of. They're easy to uninstall, but that's just another step in the setup process that no one wants to deal with.</p><p>The silver lining is that the annoying <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/glance-reportedly-us-bound-later-2024">Glance lock screen</a> is disabled by default, although it still lingers in the lock screen settings. However, a new annoyance has seemingly replaced it in the way of the Weather app, powered by 1Weather. It's a pretty busy app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-theres-a-time-and-place-for-ads">filled with ads</a> and the constant ping of weather warnings that I largely don't care about or need. This one you can't uninstall, but you can disable it or turn off the notifications because, honestly, your best bet is to stick with Google's At a Glance widget.</p><p>And while you'll find quite a bit of bloatware, one thing you won't really find is AI. The Moto G Power 2025 is a pretty barebones, straightforward phone with none of the flair you'll find on more expensive models. Likely due to limitations with the chipset, you don't get things like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-motorola-magic-canvas">Magic Canvas</a>, or any of the other cool <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> features. You do get Magic Editor and Magic Compose, although don't expect any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device AI processing</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4062px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-08" alt="Holding the Moto G Power 2025 and showing the quick settings panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Du9jhjyCvwST9AkPYJwEsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4062" height="2285" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 features a <del>triple</del> dual camera system with a 50MP primary sensor and an 8MP ultrawide that doubles as a macro sensor. The cameras are... usable. In good lighting, you can get a decent image, the shutter speed is pretty quick, and I don't hate the selfies taken with the 16MP front-facing camera. However, images are often noisy and lack detail. Lowlight images don't fare very well either.</p><p>One saving grace is the built-in Auto Enhance feature that you can switch on with a tap. It utilizes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> to automatically improve images right after they're taken, adjusting colors, lighting, and more. Improvements can be subtle, but they help to make the camera more usable.</p><p>Oh, and there's a third rear sensor, but it's just an ambient light sensor and it doesn't seem to actually be much help here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, one feature you'll want to turn <em>off</em> when you set up the Moto G Power 2025 is the RAM Boost. I'm already not a fan of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM solutions</a>, and it's turned on by default on the Power, upping its 8GB to 12GB. While it feels like it should help, the phone felt quite sluggish in my initial use, especially when gaming. It wasn't until I turned off the RAM Boost that performance improved.</p>

<p>There are a fair amount of options for anyone looking for a $300 phone. The Moto G Power 2025 competes with the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a>, which comes from Nothing's budget brand. It comes with a unique design with changeable backplates, a pretty good camera, and an AMOLED display, which isn't very common at this price point. That said, there's no NFC, and if you're in the U.S., network support is fairly spotty.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-a25-vs-moto-g-power-5g-2024">Galaxy A25</a> is also an option. Even though it's last year's model, the A25 comes with an OLED display, a 50MP triple camera system, and an impressive update promise with four OS upgrades and five years of software updates. However, if you're PWM sensitive, you may not find the display very pleasing to use. It also has a dated design with a waterdrop notch, and the Exynos chip can be quite sluggish.</p><p>Finally, there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-13-pro-long-term-review">Redmi Note 13 Pro</a>. This is also a 2024 model featuring an impressive 200MP camera, a sleek design, and great battery life. However, it's held back by hardware limitations, you'll find plenty of bloatware, and you may not wanna hold out for timely updates.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're looking for a cheap, no-frills phone.</li><li>You want a phone with great battery life and wireless charging.</li><li>You want a tough phone that will be able to take a beating.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a great camera.</li><li>You want access to Google AI features like Circle to Search.</li><li>You want a phone that can handle high-quality gaming without issue.</li></ul>
<p>In 2025, AI is the name of the game, but you won't really find that here. For $300, the Moto G Power 2025 is a solid budget phone that can get you through the day without weighing down the experience with a ton of superfluous features. It's for someone who just wants a phone that can do the basics, maybe play some games, and not much else. And honestly, that's great.</p><p>Maybe the camera could be better. Maybe the bloatware can be a little annoying. But these are the concessions you'll have to deal with at this price point, and frankly, the Moto G Power 2025 could be a lot worse. Instead, Motorola seems to be making the best out of what it could get with the Power, improving its software support, giving it flagship-level durability, and making it look better than any other $300 phone on the market.</p><p>Like the Moto G 2025, this phone surprised me, not because of how good it is, but because of how much worse it could be. It's not perfect, but you have to take it for what it is, and that's a pretty good cheap phone.</p>

It also includes bug fixes and security improvements up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-january-2025-security-patch-is-rolling-out-for-a-long-list-of-galaxy-phones">January 2025 patches</a> in the Android Security Bulletin. Interestingly, the official support document lists the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">current production firmware version</a> for the Google TV Streamer as <strong>UTT3.240625.001</strong>, but it'll likely be updated soon.</p><p>In the meantime, users on the Android TV subreddit have identified a few changes introduced with the latest Google TV Streamer update (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-tv-streamer-removes-audio-formats-3526493/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). It appears to have fixed an issue that caused certain Dolby Atmos outputs to freeze, preventing Dolby Surround from working properly. Additionally, it solves a problem with HDMI-CEC affecting volume control, per user reports. As part of the update, the TV Streamer's Voice Remote was updated to version 1.02.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1imzoyw/new_update_for_the_google_tv_streamer_rolling_out">New update for the Google TV Streamer rolling out</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV">r/AndroidTV</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Crucially, the update removes Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio as detected audio codecs for the Google TV Streamer. It appears to have ended a saga concerning high-fidelity audio on the TV Streamer. While the two Dolby audio formats were originally detectable on the Google TV Streamer, they were never available or functional. However, it was rumored that their mere existence could mean future support was possible.</p><p>With the latest Google TV Streamer update, the Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio codecs have been axed entirely. As such, it looks like these formats were never coming to the Google TV Streamer, now that they're no longer showing up as detectable outputs.</p><p>While it may be a bummer for audio fans, the Google TV Streamer still supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital, and Dolby Digital Plus.</p>

<ul><li>Rumors claim OPPO and OnePlus are developing an Alert Slider replacement that brings more customization for users.</li><li>The new hardware feature could mirror Apple's Action Button, which is introduced on the iPhone 15 Pro.</li><li>The future of OnePlus' foldables is a little bleak as the company confirmed it will not launch the Open 2 in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>New rumors are swirling about the direction OPPO and OnePlus may take the next generation of phones.</p><p>The alleged new direction was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PeezJcEjg">posted on Weibo</a> by Digital Chat Station (DCS), which claims both companies could drop the Alert Slider (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/14/oneplus-alert-slider-button-replacement-report/">9to5Google</a>). The tipster states each Chinese OEM is looking to replace the notification-focused button with one that's more "customizable" — and it seems Apple may have influenced this. OPPO and OnePlus are rumored to develop a button similar to the iPhone's Action button.</p><p>The machine-translated post says this button could be called the "Magic Cube Key." This seems more like an internal name, but we'll have to see when/if it happens.</p><p>Additionally, DCS claims the button could let users "mute, customize the flash, screenshot, photo, translation, custom quick launch app" and more. Rumors say this button is aimed at "new phones," which makes us wonder if we'd see it on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 14</a>, for example.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Android Central's Andrew Myrick said in 2023 that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-made-the-right-decision-to-ditch-the-mute-switch-on-the-iphone-15-pro">OnePlus could implement</a> something similar to Apple's Action button due to its Alert Slider feature. Apple debuted the new button on the iPhone 15 Pro, which replaced the old physical mute button. The replacement still lets users mute audio, but it adds the ability to launch the camera app and the flashlight.</p><p>The button added even more customization by letting users launch their camera app in a specific mode of choice if the Action button is pressed.</p><p>In other news, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">recently confirmed</a> that its foldable successor, the Open 2, will not launch this year. In a blog post, the company's product manager, Vale G, said OnePlus was "recalibrating" its "foldable strategy." As a result, its next-gen foldable will not see its highly anticipated 2025 debut.</p><p>This is interesting considering OPPO and OnePlus typically share hardware specs and designs. However, the former isn't pulling back on its next foldable, the Find N5. That device is still gearing up for a February 20 launch. OnePlus likely needs more time to polish its foldable as Vale G stated, "...we believe this is the right approach for us at this time."</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> temporarily avoided disaster by reaching a temporary deal with Paramount to keeps its channels and properties available on the streaming services. As the two sides negotiated, YouTube TV announced Feb. 12 that Paramount channels might disappear as it was unable to reach what it considered "a fair deal." However, it later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/youtube-tv-and-paramount-programming-update/" target="_blank">announced</a> that Paramount channels would continue to be available on YouTube TV in the near future as the two sides continue to find a long-term solution.</p><p>"We’ve reached a short term extension as we work toward a deal with Paramount to keep their content on YouTube TV. YouTube TV subscribers continue to have access to Paramount channels, including CBS, and any recordings that are in their Library," the company wrote in the blog post. "We appreciate your patience as we continue to negotiate on your behalf. We also value Paramount's partnership and willingness to work towards an agreement."</p><p>It's unclear how long this short-term extension will last. Paramount provides 34 channels on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a>, including CBS, CBS Sports, MTV, Comedy Central, and regional stations. It also enables extra services, like Paramount Plus with SHOWTIME and BET Plus.</p><p>YouTube TV customers are frustrated by the developments, as the streaming service recently increased prices by $10, from $73 to $83, just one month ago. Additionally, the timing of the rights dispute is unfortunate, with March Madness (the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) and The Masters tournament coming up in March and April — airing on CBS and CBS Sports.</p>

<p>For now, YouTube TV customers can still access Paramount channels, but it's unclear how long that'll last if a true deal isn't reached.

<ul><li>Google is reportedly rolling out an update for the Contacts app that brings more customization and uniqueness to your saves.</li><li>Users will soon find a "Monogram" tab that lets them customize a letter-based or emoji-based profile icon for contacts.</li><li>Google has been slowly working on upgrading its Contacts app by implementing a total redesign and revamped creation page.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is seemingly in the early stages of a Contacts app update that lets you set quirky pictures for people you know.</p><p>AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-contacts-creative-contact-pictures-3524348/">Android Authority</a>) spotted an update for the Contacts app, which brings a third "Choose Picture" option for saved numbers. Users should soon notice a "Monogram" tab on the far right of the usual "Device Photos" and Google Photos choices. Tapping Monogram lets users edit a letter-based profile icon that mirrors what you'd normally find for saved contacts.</p><p>The core of this addition is the circular profile icon with the (defaulted) letter "A." Users can tap this and customize it by inputting the letter of their choice. Beneath, there's an "Inspire Me" button, which the tipster states will "automatically set the font and background color."</p><p>Within the Monogram tab is a secondary profile option called "Emoji." From here, users can follow the same steps and tap the center to assign an emoji for a saved contact. The emojis offer a little extra as users can choose to have a fully colorized character represent their contact. Think of a full red heart or a bright yellow sun. The second option, titled "Monochrome," changes the tone.</p><p>From the tipster's example, it doesn't turn your contact's icon black and white, instead, it mirrors Android's "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-enable-themed-icons-in-android-13">Themed Icons</a>." The emoji loses its color and takes on a light and dark theme per your chosen background.</p><p>The Monogram and Emoji photo options let users decide between six colors and five font styles (monogram only).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:633px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:94.79%;"><img id="B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c" name="google-contacts-monogram-profile-icon-option" alt="Google Contacts' latest update lets users customize their saved contact's profile icon with a monogram letter or an emoji." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B8eLkD5BVW9p2LAQyWQm8c.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="633" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The tipster claims the update is rolling out with Google Contacts v4.48.27.720; however, they haven't received it yet. We've checked on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-2023-review">Moto Edge Plus 2023</a> and the update isn't available. So, the update is likely slowly making its way onto Android devices as we close the week.</p><p>Google has been working on refreshing the Contacts app for a while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-navigation-update-custom-ringtones">with updates like its total redesign</a> last March. One of the major changes was the removal of the navigational drawer for a dropdown menu, instead. Elsewhere, the primary contact creation page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-less-cluttered-creation-redesign-spotted">was redesigned to be simpler</a>. In short, Google placed the most important aspects of your contact, like their first name, last name, company, and phone number first.</p><p>The redesign gave larger buttons for other, commonly used additions like their email and more under that. Regarding auxiliary options (middle name, suffix, and prefix), Google shoved those into an "add fields" button at the bottom.</p><p>The company was also spotted working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-contacts-quicker-video-call-process-tipped">initiating video calls</a> even quicker through Contacts.</p>

<hr>
<p>ByteDance's TikTok has reportedly returned to app stores in the U.S. following the U.S. government's reported "reassurances."</p><p>According to Mark Gurman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-02-14/apple-to-restore-tiktok-to-us-app-store-following-justice-department-letter">Bloomberg</a>, TikTok was first spotted reappearing on the Apple App Store. Users on X chimed in, reporting that the app had returned as early as Wednesday, February 12. Experiences vary as some had more difficulties than others, but it seems more widely available for Apple's iPhones today (Feb 14.)</p><p>Additionally, the publication reports that the app has reappeared on the Google Play Store. Android Central has also spotted TikTok's availability via the Play Store, so users who may have deleted the app or never had it before can download it.</p><p>The publication states that TikTok's return to Google and Apple resulted from a letter from the U.S. Attorney General, Pam Bondi. The letter supposedly offered consolation that the proposed U.S. ban wouldn't "immediately" take effect.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/tiktok-shuts-down-in-us" target="_blank">U.S. government originally banned TikTok</a> on January 19 after its parent company, ByteDance, declined to sell the app. This followed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-bill-to-ban-tiktok-signed-into-law">bill signed into law</a> in April 2024, which targeted the app over its Chinese ownership and the possibility of a "national security threat." U.S. users were left with a message when opening TikTok, highlighting its ban, but there was some hope.</p><p>TikTok stated "President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate" the app <em>after </em>his inauguration.</p><p>The company started working with service providers to restore TikTok's services for users in the U.S., despite the app's removal from stores. However, there's still a lot of work to do. Bloomberg states TikTok has 75 days (from Jan 20) to work with the U.S. government to find common ground with privacy/security concerns over its citizen's data. This means we'll have to wait and see if TikTok is back for good in April 2025.</p><p>The publication adds that ByteDance remains against divesting any part of TikTok to the U.S. The Chinese-based company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/bytedance-is-willing-to-ditch-tiktok-in-the-us-instead-of-selling-it-off">stood firm on that sentiment last year</a>, stating it would rather ditch its U.S. presence than sell. ByteDance said the "special algorithms" used for TikTok would make selling the app difficult. Moreover, these algorithms are a crucial part of the app's business, and trying to make things work in a sell might cause more harm.</p>

Without having touched one, I think the pros far outweigh the cons; if you need a new phone and are ready to pay flagship pricing, the S25 Ultra is definitely worth looking at.</p><p>It's not without its fair share of controversy, of course. You have the whole <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-qi2-and-the-galaxy-s25">Qi2 without any magnets</a> issue that plenty of people don't like because they want or need to magnetically stick things to the back of their phone.</p><p>I expected this when the WPC had to rework the Qi2 spec to include "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qi2-will-come-to-more-android-phones-in-2025-with-help-from-samsung-and-google">Qi2 Ready</a>" devices that lose the magnetic requirement, and have no real opinion on it. Buy the case with magnets if you really need it and the issue is solved.</p>

<p>What can't be fixed, though, is the dumbing down of the S Pen. Samsung removed the Bluetooth functionality of the S Pen with the S25 Ultra, claiming that fewer than 0.5% of users were taking advantage of the feature. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-retracts-previous-bluetooth-s-pen-references-galaxy-s25-ultra">it's never coming to the S25 Ultra</a> because crucial hardware isn't in place and the software to control it has been removed from the device.</p><p>Surprisingly, most of that hardware is still in place inside the Pen itself. The circuit board and wiring exist, but the board itself doesn't have the tiny components in place. Without knowing exactly what the part numbers of those components were, I can still estimate that they cost about $2.00. In other words, Samsung is probably saving two bucks per phone by removing the S Pen's advanced features.</p><p>This is dumb. You should never nickel and dime your way to a higher profit margin on your most upscale and premium product. If you want to sell a device that costs $1,300, you need to find another way to increase your margins.</p>

<p>This isn't something most people will care about. The removal of things like the headphone jack or SD card affected everyone, so outrage was expected, but Samsung is right when it says that almost nobody used the Bluetooth functions of the S Pen, so almost nobody is affected by this.</p><p>That doesn't matter because of <em><strong>who</strong></em> is affected: Samsung's "elite" fanbase. These are users who buy the Galaxy S Ultra every year because of things like an advanced active stylus that's deeply integrated into the operating system. Even if they'll never use them, features like this are the reasons why the Galaxy S Ultra is the best phone money can buy in their eyes.</p><p>Yes, the savings are massive — $2 per phone and 25 million phones sold is $50 million — but is the black eye worth it? This path only leads to losing some of your elite users while you save some money.</p>
<p>I have no skin in this game. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/for-me-the-right-time-to-buy-a-galaxy-s25-is-next-year">I'm not interested in buying a Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> (though I would recommend it to a few people I know), and even if I were, I'm not worried about a smarter S Pen. But I do know what looks good and what looks bad from a customer's point of view because I am a customer first and a tech writer second.</p><p>I wouldn't be surprised to see both magnetic Qi2 charging and the return of Bluetooth for the S Pen on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">S26 Ultra</a>, but I also wouldn't be surprised not to see them. It all depends on which choice Samsung thinks is best for its bottom line.</p>

<hr>
<p>The language-learning app Duolingo announced on X earlier this week that its fun Owl mascot has died, and the cause of the bird's death is still under investigation.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/duolingo/status/1889328809054224698">post</a>, the company stated that the authorities are currently investigating the cause and that it's cooperating with them. It also added, "We're aware he had many enemies, but we kindly ask that you refrain from sharing why you hate him."</p><p>It jokingly pointed at the Duolingo users, who could be the reason behind the bird's passing. "Tbh (to be honest), he probably died waiting for you to do your lesson, but what do we know."</p><p>In the midst of all this,  the company didn't miss a beat to ask users to subscribe to Duolingo Max as a memory of the beloved bird.</p><p>While we feel that this hints at another collaboration or rebranding, the brand also took a moment to mention Dua Lipa at the end of the statement. It could also be because they have similar-sounding names and have frequently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7398184301810044191" target="_blank">posted videos</a> showing the two as a couple.</p><p>In a fun <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@duolingo/video/7470231646059679022" target="_blank">TikTok video</a>, Duolingo's other characters, Lily and Zari, were seen carrying the owl's coffin around the office and then to a pickup truck that took the bird away.</p><p>In a follow-up tweet, the company posted a video of the bird being hit by a Telsa Cybertruck, the owl passing through different realms of the universe, and a reward for whoever can identify the driver.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">UPDATE: Reward for whoever can identify the driver. Please post any leads on Twitter.

<p>As the suspense to uncover the culprits keeps mounting, Duolingo took to X on Feb. 13 to announce that all its characters are now dead, with a caption stating that it "believes in transparency and wanted to share this heartbreaking update. We are investigating and want to keep all informed."</p><p>Duolingo's profile picture has been updated to a dead owl, so we aren't sure where the company is going with all these 'deaths.' In another follow-up video posted this morning (Feb. 14), Duolingo reveals the reason other mascots from the office have died but nothing about the owl. Watch below.</p>

After explaining why I'm excited about the OnePlus Open 2, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-says-it-will-not-be-launching-the-oneplus-open-2-this-year">announced</a> that it wouldn't actually be releasing a successor to the OnePlus Open.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1652471315484901379">Community Forum post</a>, the reason for this is explained as being a "recalibration" while also giving props to the upcoming OPPO Find N5. It also says that OnePlus is "committed to developing products that will redefine multiple categories and bring you experiences that are as innovative and exciting as ever."</p><p>But here's the thing — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and Find N3 were essentially the same phone, just with a different logo. The merging of OPPO and OnePlus has grown even more, as OxygenOS and Color OS are practically identical, just with the appropriate branding. So instead of following that recipe again, which clearly worked, OnePlus is taking a step back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.96%;"><img id="CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 shown next to iPhone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CRdG7U4xFCz8o6FfrpKW6m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1029" height="689" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OPPO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the Find N5 will see a global release, it's highly unlikely that you'll be able to get one in the States unless you import one. Maybe OPPO will surprise us during the Find N5 launch event, but I wouldn't hold my breath.</p><p>So, what does this mean for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>? Well, it certainly doesn't bode well for the state of foldable phones in North America. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google's Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> is fantastic in most aspects. However, the Tensor G4 doesn't match up to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, let alone the newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>. The cameras are better than that of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 but aren't as good as the Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>Meanwhile, Samsung is more focused on figuring out ways to put its foldables on the back burner. For example, the stable version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a> is only available with the Galaxy S25 series, while the beta is still limited to just the Galaxy S24 series. And we have no idea or indication as to when Samsung's $1,800 phone will get the latest software update.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1131px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-promo-render.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Special Edition promo render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hXWgyEfPvQgs4vgXNzLxwM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1131" height="636" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's still a bit too early for even the rumor mill to start churning out information about the next Pixel foldable. And all signs point to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> being a slightly improved version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold SE</a> that saw a limited release last year.</p><p>So, barring anything unexpected, we're in store for what will probably shake out to be another boring year. However, there seems to be a decent chance that won't be the case once 2026 rolls around.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1094873855464599552">report</a> has been making its rounds suggesting Apple will finally enter the foldable phone game in late 2026. The company has been rumored to be working on a foldable phone for years, but development reportedly picked up steam in late 2024, with Apple beginning to work with display manufacturers.</p><p>According to the report, Apple is expected to go with a book-style foldable with its first attempt. It is said to be 9.2mm thin when folded, while "the internal screen is comparable to two 6.1-inch phones folded together, resulting in a total size of over 12 inches."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Recent Apple Foldable iPhone Supply Chain Research Summary — 250120 (By zwz)1. Appearance• Features a large folding mechanism on the left rear side.• Folded thickness: 9.2 mm; single-side thickness: 4.6 mm.• The internal screen is comparable to two 6.1‑inch phones… https://t.co/UM2rGMQIwp<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1887400182343737730">February 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>I'm not 100% convinced that Apple would release an iPhone with such an enormous screen. I do think that we're going to end up with something that looks more like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and less like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's still just conjecture, and we're likely months away (at least) from any substantive rumors or leaks. And with OnePlus opting against releasing the Open 2 in 2025, things are looking pretty grim for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. With that in mind, Apple is probably now the only company that could spark excitement for foldable phones.</p>

<p>The aforementioned report suggests Apple will sell between eight and ten million units in 2026 before that number doubles to 20 million in 2027. Oh, and who would be making the display? Reportedly, it's "exclusively developed by Samsung."</p><p>So, while OnePlus ripped out my heart just in time for Valentine's Day, I might again need to rely on Apple to pick up the pieces of what's left. Seriously, man, this sucks.</p>

Even though OnePlus didn't launch a successor in 2024, the Open held up incredibly well against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ill-admit-it-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-is-better-than-i-imagined">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> — which tells you a lot about Samsung's strategy. <br><br>I was excited for the Open 2, but the foldable has been put on ice — indefinitely. OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1652471315484901379">announced on its forums</a> that it will not launch a foldable this year, with OPPO instead taking the lead with the Find N5. "At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year."<br><br>OnePlus says it isn't exiting the category entirely, but even if it were to launch a device next year, it would effectively have to start from scratch, and I don't understand why the manufacturer isn't debuting the Find N5 in global markets as the Open 2. This is what it did with the Open — which was a rebranded Find N3 — so to not do the same in 2025 feels short-sighted.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="C8EQsGDeoes3L9gEtMmphK" name="oneplus-open-37.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C8EQsGDeoes3L9gEtMmphK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus is basically ceding ground to Samsung in this category, and with the Open 2 not launching this year, there isn't a meaningful rival to the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> outside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. I really like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> and Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">X Fold3</a>, but neither foldable is available in North America. Availability in the region was what gave the Open a distinct advantage, and OnePlus is losing out on that this time. <br><br>OPPO has good presence in Asia and is once again starting to sell its products in select western markets, but it doesn't have a foothold in North America — the region was seen as OnePlus's territory within the BBK conglomerate. While I'm excited to use the Find N5 — it promises to be the thinnest foldable yet — it won't be sold in anywhere as many regions, and that's annoying. <br><br>OnePlus's strategy just doesn't make any sense to me. Obviously, the Open wouldn't have sold in nearly as many numbers as the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus 12, but it built a strong foundation for the manufacturer, and to not expand on that is the wrong move. If anything, the Open 2 was set to be the biggest challenger to Samsung's dominance in North America, and as the device isn't launching now, there's even less incentive for the brand to introduce any meaningful changes with the Z Fold 7.</p>

<p>I used over a dozen phones powered by the latest chipsets in the last three months, and it's time to take a look at how they differ. Before I get to the benchmarks, a quick overview of what's new this year. Obviously, we need to start with Qualcomm, because the Snapdragon 8 Elite is different to what we've seen in the past. <br><br>Qualcomm went to a fully custom CPU design in a move that's similar to what Apple does with its own silicon, and it allowed the chip vendor to fine-tune the platform by a considerable amount. It isn't astonishing, then, that the platform has the best single-and multi-core CPU scores of anything I tested, and it even outmatches the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> — a huge deal in and of itself. <br><br>The gains with the GPU aren't as noticeable, and while it continues to be one of the best around, it doesn't have an outsized lead. Thankfully, MediaTek was also able to deliver a platform that's fantastic, and the Dimensity 9400 has enticing upgrades. Although it uses stock Arm cores, MediaTek's decision to exclusively leverage big cores makes a clear difference when it comes to performance. MediaTek has been doing this for two years now, and it nailed the fundamentals.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro next to X100 Ultra and X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tnQFm9H45FUYJfTN2KTfwT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interestingly, the GPU on the Dimensity 9400 is able to hold its own against what Qualcomm is offering. That just hasn't been the case in previous years, and I even managed to get better scores with the Immortalis-G925 than the Adreno 830. Qualcomm still leads the way with sustained performance, but it's great to see MediaTek gaining ground in this key area. <br><br>There isn't much to talk about the Tensor G4, as Google is using the same core configuration and manufacturing node as the G3. While Qualcomm and MediaTek made the switch to a 3nm node — delivering big gains in efficiency — Google is still using the 4nm node, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL doesn't quite have the same battery longevity. <br><br>I'm using ASUS's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> as the Qualcomm baseline as it has a good thermal solution while still technically being a mainstream phone. I went with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> to highlight the Dimensity 9400; while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> also uses the same platform, I felt that the X200 Pro did a better job at gaming, so that's the one I'm using. And with Google, the Pixel 9 Pro XL has the best thermal management system in the Pixel 9 series, so that's the one I used.</p>

<p>When it comes to the CPU, it's clear that Qualcomm has a definite edge this year. The custom design allowed devices like the Zenfone 12 Ultra and Honor Magic 7 Pro to net the best scores in Geekbench 6's single- and multi-core workloads, and I don't see this changing over the course of 2025. The Dimensity 9400 does a great job as well, and while it is faster than last year, it doesn't outshine Qualcomm. <br><br>As you can imagine, the Pixel 9 Pro XL lags behind its rivals, posting scores that just don't measure up — the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3-based <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> does a better job. Annoyingly, it's a similar story with the GPU as well, and the device just doesn't come close to 2025 flagships. That said, I didn't see any slowdowns in regular use, and if anything, Google did a great job with optimization with the Android 15 update, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has much better fluidity than previous years. <br><br>The biggest issue is that the 9 Pro XL just doesn't deliver the same level of performance in demanding games. You don't get stable framerates, it throttles too soon, and it doesn't even measure up to Qualcomm and MediaTek's 2024 offerings, much less their latest platforms. <br><br>Google says it positioned on-device AI as the differentiator with the Tensor G4, but even in this area, it doesn't do anywhere as well as Qualcomm. It has a slender lead over the Dimensity 9400 in Geekbench's AI workloads, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra once again has the distinct edge, with Qualcomm's NPU clearly the one to beat.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="BavKZKQ67owN3X36CAA3WR" name="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra" alt="ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra running Balatro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BavKZKQ67owN3X36CAA3WR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to gaming, the Immortalis-G925 in the Dimensity 9400 delivered the best scores in 3DMark's Wild Life Extreme and Solar Bay tests. That said, the platform tends to throttle aggressively, and the X200 Pro had a stability score of just 49% in the demanding Steel Nomad Light endurance run. By contrast, Qualcomm-powered devices managed a score of at least 70%, with most devices going up to 90% in the same test. <br><br>The downside to limited throttling is that Qualcomm-based devices tend to run hotter. The X200 Pro went up to a maximum of 44 degrees Celsius after an extended gaming session, but the Zenfone 12 Ultra hit 46 degrees, and Nubia's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Z70 Ultra</a> got up to 59 degrees — the highest of any phone I tested. <br><br>Synthetic tests don't reveal the whole story, but having used these devices for an extended amount of time, what's clear is that both Qualcomm and MediaTek have done a fabulous job this year. I'm glad that MediaTek is able to deliver a product that goes up against Qualcomm in the high-end category — that just hasn't been the case in previous years.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT" name="Vivo X200 Pro" alt="Vivo X200 Pro camera module highlighted" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qiif6RCHLRxEGXK4QbHyjT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another interesting point is the ISP; while Qualcomm continues to make gains in this area, MediaTek outdid itself this year, with the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro delivering the best camera packages of 2025. Of course, the camera hardware and tuning makes a sizeable difference, but the ISP on the Dimensity 9400 is an integral part of the package, and MediaTek did all the right things. <br><br>It's a similar situation with battery life. The key talking point is the introduction of silicon-carbon battery tech, and Dimensity 9400-powered devices have a clear edge when it comes to battery life. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> and Vivo X200 Pro have identical 6000mAh cells, the X200 Pro managed to last longer in my testing, delivering an additional hour of screen-on-time. <br><br>I didn't do any quantitative battery testing, but my usage across devices is roughly unchanged, and the two phones that delivered the best battery life are the X200 Pro and Find X8 Pro, both powered by the Dimensity 9400. Ultimately, both Qualcomm and MediaTek did a standout job with their 2025 designs, and while MediaTek is seeing better design wins, Qualcomm continues to dominate the North American market. I don't see that status quo changing anytime soon, but what's refreshing is that MediaTek has a viable alternative in the Dimensity 9400 in other global markets.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is continuing to place its next (a) series phone on people's minds as its newest teaser encompasses its chipset.</p><p>Nothing posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nothing/status/1889977826507628971">an image teaser on X</a> about what consumers can expect, capability-wise, out of the budget Phone 3a. The image was simple, yet marked the return to Qualcomm's SoC with the statement "Hello Snapdragon!" Beneath, the provided image is of a Snapdragon SoC with a specific white and red chip image.</p><p>Nothing adds, "Our perfect match for elite performance. Now powering up the (3a) Series."</p><p>On Qualcomm's side, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Snapdragon/status/1890061457574035576">quote-reposted</a> a quick video from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei discussing the Phone 3a. Pei announced the return of Qualcomm's Snapdragon series chips on the next-gen (a) series phone, while also detailing some notable improvements. According to Pei, the Phone 3a will boast a 25% increase in CPU speed and a 72% quicker NPU compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-plus-is-here-and-its-got-a-chip-no-one-else-has">Phone 2a Plus</a>.</p><p>That device features the MediaTek Dimensity 7350 Pro.</p><p>Additionally, Pei says the company has worked to improve the Phone 3a's camera, based on user feedback. The device's cameras will reportedly be more "efficient" than before.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hello @Snapdragon! Our perfect match for elite performance.

<p>While neither side has confirmed the chip for the Phone 3a, many users in the replies believe it to be the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3. This <em>could </em>be true, mainly because the official images of this chip, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">when it launched</a>, looked the same as what Nothing teased today (Feb 13). Furthering this is a leak from December concerning the Phone 3a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-future-trio-specs-database-leak">in the IMEI database</a>.</p><p>The listing showed the device supported by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 7s Gen 3, a chip designed for budget phones, but with loads of AI capabilities. The chip was also stated to deliver a better camera and gaming experience while also supporting the Baichuan-7B and Llama 2 AI models.</p><p>There's also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3-leaked-memo">that leaked memo</a> from Nothing's CEO Carl Pei that suggested it could take bigger strides toward on-device AI.</p><p>That aside, at the end of January, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch-quarterly-update-confirmed">Nothing confirmed</a> that the "Phone 3a Series" was launching on March 4 at 5 am ET.  Users can sign up to stay in the loop about the phone via nothing.tech, so you're ready for launch (and pre-orders if interested). The company recently teased a hardware change for the Phone 3a by way of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-camera-button-official-teaser">physical camera button</a>.</p><p>It seems users will be able to take photos without tapping their screens, similar to what Apple did with the iPhone 16.</p>

<ul><li>Google is updating Gemini Live to use the latest AI models, likely one of the Gemini 2.0 stable or experimental models.</li><li>It's also changing the Gemini privacy policy, saying that audio, video, and screen share data may be collected.</li><li>Google will also bring screen sharing and live video streaming support to Gemini Live in the future.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is upgrading <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/gemini-live-pixel-9-pro-grocery-list">Gemini Live</a> with a new AI models, and is planning a few fresh features to upgrade the experience. It announced the changes in an email to some Gemini Live users late Wednesday, Feb. 12. The move comes after Google recently updated the chatbot in the Gemini app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">to use the latest Gemini 2.0 stable and experimental models</a>.</p><p>"Google is starting to roll out updates to Gemini to make your conversations even more dynamic and engaging," the email reads. "With our latest model, Live can better understand multiple languages, dialects, or accents in a single Live chat and help with your translation needs."</p><p>While Google does not explicitly state which Gemini model is powering the new Gemini Live experiences, it stands to reason it's one of the new AI models in the Gemini 2.0 family. Announced late last year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0 models</a> build on the Gemini 1.5 series, and perform comparably to the latest OpenAI models in their category. Since then, Google has been steadily delivering various experimental and stable Gemini 2.0 models, including Gemini 2.0 Flash, Gemini 2.0 Flash Experimental, Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, and Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental.</p><p>You can read the full email from Google in the screenshot provided by Android Central below.</p>

<p>The email update also previews two new Gemini Live features coming later: screen sharing and live video streaming. It communicates new data sharing settings for Gemini Live, noting that user audio, video, and screen shares will be stored by Google.</p><p>"As part of providing this improved experience, your audio, video, and screenshares are stored in your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://notifications.google.com/g/p/ANiao5r_VZJXj-0CEZg0HMLcsbjRwAsrOtRS1mQA5HOQpeS4OQ6iIFGQMR-3zzNz2Tr_5ni-I8y5GQRCszWKXFKIM5XYvsTiLXfOWK6QNEK2rKm2ZY1yES9axb5npns7wIgwQ8Xb6I4uynNamH2jEaM57JIRkEnqyYqnNnkGDt-5A_0" target="_blank"><strong>Gemini Apps Activity</strong></a> (if it’s on)," Google explains.

However, the company does say that it would be "transparent if that changes," and this email seemingly fulfills that promise.</p>

<p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/12/gemini-live-model-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> points out, Gemini Live could be planning to integrate the Multimodal Live API that was showcased alongside Gemini 2.0. The live-streaming capabilities could refer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Astra</a>, which we tried at Google I/O 2024.

<ul><li>A Korean Samsung community forum user posted a screenshot of the February 2025 security patch hitting the Galaxy S25 series.</li><li>The patch is light on S25-specific fixes/additions; however, there's a large amount of security flaw fixes this month.</li><li>The Galaxy S24 received its update earlier in February, which is on a sour note as it's still based on Android 14 while it awaits another One UI 7 beta.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has been spotted pushing its first monthly patch to its newest flagship smartphone trio.</p><p>Notice of the February 2025 security patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/25%EC%8B%9C%EB%A6%AC%EC%A6%88-2%EC%9B%94-%EB%B3%B4%EC%95%88%ED%8C%A8%EC%B9%98-%EC%97%85%EB%8D%B0%EC%9D%B4%ED%8A%B8/td-p/31728962">was spotted by a user</a> in Samsung's Korean forums (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/first-galaxy-s25-software-update-released/">SamMobile</a>). The user stated the update had hit their Galaxy S25, which means the Galaxy S25 Plus and S25 Ultra should also have it shortly. The patch bears firmware number S93xNKSU1AYB3 and concerns the One UI 7 (Android 15) software the latest trio launched with.</p><p>The user provided a screenshot of their device's software update notice. This first patch is incredibly light as Samsung details "stabilization" improvements (machine-translated). Additionally, the brief changelog states the company has applied Google's Android-related security patches for this month, too.</p><p>For Google's side, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-02-01">Android Security Bulletin</a> lists 17 "High" level framework fixes and five "High" system fixes for February.</p><p>Samsung always packages these with its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb"> own set of security fixes</a> and, this time, that involves "7 Samsung Vulnerabilities and Exposures (SVE)." The Korean OEM detailed a fix that should remove an attacker's ability to "cause memory corruption" on its Galaxy S25 devices. A second fix involves Qualcomm's chipsets, which states attackers should no longer be able to "read and write out-of-bounds memory."</p><p>The patch has only been spotted in South Korea so far. Since the week is at its end, those in other areas (like the U.S. and Europe) <em>may </em>see it sometime next week. If you're curious, you can always continue to check your device manually for the February 2025 patch.</p><p>The latest flagship series grabs its monthly patch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-february-2025-patch-for-galaxy-s24-arrives-amid-one-ui-7-delays">shortly after</a> the Galaxy S24 series did at the top of the month. That patch was also pretty light on S24-specific fixes; however, the same slew of security flaws were fixed, like with the S25 series. Moreover, the patch for the Galaxy S24 is a little sour considering those users are still waiting on One UI 7 (Android 15). The current patch is based on One UI 6.1.1. (Android 14).</p><p>If you missed it, Samsung had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">reportedly pushed back</a> the official rollout of One UI 7 for the Galaxy S24 (and others) due to another problem. It was discovered that using "Natural" mode in its screen optimization menu caused the phone's display to turn more yellow than intended. The company stated it was confident that the problem would be rectified in Beta 4, but that means more waiting for stable users.</p><p>It's not all bad as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">Samsung confirmed</a> One UI 7 was coming "imminently" to its past-gen Galaxy S phones. We're expected to see the major OS upgrade in Q1 2025, meaning some time between now and the end of March.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Alien: Rogue Incursion is one of the finest examples of how to cleverly adapt a famous movie IP into a VR game — that is if you can get past the poor performance and even worse visual quality. It's the latest Meta Quest 3 game from veteran VR developer Survios, known best for the Creed series of VR and non-VR games, plus a handful of VR classics like Raw Data and Sprint Vector.</p>

<p>While the game was released on PC VR and the PSVR 2 on December 19, 2024, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> version was delayed two months, almost certainly to remake most of the game's visual assets to fit better on Quest. Aside from lower-quality assets when compared to the PlayStation or PC releases, Survios also tweaked the lighting in many areas to work better for the Quest 3's screens and power.</p><p>It's not these changes that are so offensive, though. Rather, it's the resolution and downright sub-par performance. It's the lowest-resolution game I can recall ever seeing on Quest 3, and the game still chugs when moving between areas. Developer Survios says a patch is coming as early as next week (at the time this is written) to address these issues, but until then, gamers will have to deal with them.</p><p>But if you can get past the poor visuals, you'll be treated to one of the better action-horror games on the Meta Quest platform. That's especially true if you enjoy the Alien movies and the sci-fi universe within them. Alien: Rogue Incursion is Part 1 of at least a 2-part game series, although Part 2 doesn't have a definitive release date just yet.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>The on-body inventory system is among the very best I've used in any VR game.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>From the moment the game began, I knew I was in for something special as far as gameplay goes. The intro is simple enough but also introduces a great way to get the player used to the game's mechanics without feeling obtuse. Alien: Rogue Incursion uses a combination of shooting, puzzle-solving, and key card-hunting gameplay mechanics to excellent effect.</p><p>The on-body inventory system is among the very best I've used in any VR game. Two large guns can fit on your back — shotgun over your left shoulder, assault rifle over the right — a pistol on your right hip, ammo on your left hip. Grabbing the ammo always presents the right kind for the gun you're carrying, assuming you have enough ammo in your inventory.</p><p>On the left arm, you'll find healing syringes on the forearm and grenades attached to the shoulder. The right shoulder holds the motion tracker, which is always active, giving you forewarning of anything moving in the shadows. Picking it up will let you scan the surroundings and get a rough idea of the direction Xenomorphs are coming from, but not much else. It helps get rid of cheap jump scares and allows you to prepare for battle rather than being surprised all the time.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Problems from the initial release in December have all been addressed, including better enemy difficulty and spawn rates and weapon handling bugs squashed.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The initial launch was met with plenty of criticism, from ridiculous spawn rates of Xenomorphs — which made it feel more like an arcade game than an action-horror one — to bugs with guns and a distinct lack of ammo to be found. All of these issues have been addressed in the Meta Quest 3 launch and the subsequent patch has also been issued to the PC and PS5 versions.</p><p>Now, the balance feels nearly perfect. Aliens take 2-3 direct hits from a shotgun to dispatch — a weapon you don't even have for the first hour or two of the game — roughly 30 bullets from the assault rifle or a few rounds from your pistol. Meanwhile, two shots from a Xenomorph will be the end of you, so you'll need to be strategic about every encounter you get in. Most Xenomorphs travel in packs, and you'll do your best to remember that.</p><p>Gun handling is superb, although I don't like the sound of the assault rifle. It sounds tinny and hollow compared to the punchier sounds from the pistol and shotgun. Placing a sticky grenade as a trap for oncoming Xenomorphs never seems to get old, although the physics of Xenomoph deaths tend to be more comical than realistic. Maybe comic relief is needed to keep the tension down.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Tools and weapons have a very satisfying tactile feel. Survios has been honing these kinds of interactive systems for a decade now, and it shows.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Throughout the game, you'll make your way across a research base on a remote planet to unravel the events that occurred. Everyone at the station has either fled or is dead, and it's not long until you figure out why. Since you're the only living human there, getting around through locked-down, high-security areas requires a bit of work. Thankfully, your faithful Synthetic — maybe we should call him an Android in keeping with our site? — is there to assist.</p><p>Aside from combat assistance early in the game, he'll also help guide you across the station to get from one objective to the next and hack terminals through your PDA, which handily docks into computers — so long as they have power. If you boil it down, you're essentially playing a more complicated Doom as you look for colored key cards to access different parts of the station.</p><p>But it's not all badge scanning or computer hacking. Many puzzles require you to rewire electrical panels with special tools, un-weld sealed doors, or just blast through with your assault rifle's special rounds. They're extremely satisfying, and traversal through the large station and ship is made even better by the excellent map on your interactive PDA.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jh93yyNdantC7cHu3pZwvH" name="alien-rogue-incursion-computer-interaction" alt="Gameplay from Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 showing computer interaction" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jh93yyNdantC7cHu3pZwvH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Puzzles, environment interaction, and weapon handling are among some of the game's strong suits.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Environment and tool interaction is another strong point of the game. The PDA is a touchscreen device that you'll need to physically grab and interact with as if it were a modern-day tablet. Hold it with one hand and touch the display with your fingers on the other. It feels authentic, and interacting with the many computer terminals throughout the game might be even more fun since you'll grab the joystick and use it to move a mouse cursor around the screen.</p><p>Tools all have a very satisfying tactile feel. From the pop of the torch on the welding tool to the clamp of the wrench during rewiring puzzles, every interaction feels like a veteran VR studio made it — because it did, of course. Survios has been honing these kinds of interactive systems for a decade now, and it shows.</p><p>Even the story is compelling and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. I'm not the biggest Alien fan in the world, but I've seen a few of the movies and love the lore and character designs — especially the Xenomorphs. A twist about 2 hours in really shakes things up for the rest of the game, leaving me to wonder what's going to happen in Part 2 when it eventually releases.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Quest Games Optimizer helps fix the game's visual problems, but that's a third party tool most users won't bother to try.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Of course, all of these positive feelings only go so far when the performance and visual quality of the game are as poor as they are. The game runs at 36FPS most of the time but has significant hitching when loading new areas or trying to do anything else on the Quest, like capturing a screenshot or video. If you're sensitive to low frame rate, this is <em>not</em> a game you should play.</p><p>Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/application-space-warp-samurai-slaughter-house-pc-vr-quest-ports">Application Space Warp</a> technology enables the game to run at a "reprojected" 72FPS, so it doesn't feel like a slow-motion action scene the whole time, but this leaves some odd visual artifacts at times. This could all be forgiven if the game's resolution were substantially higher than it was, but at least by default, it's the lowest-resolution game I've ever seen on Quest, and it dynamically scales the resolution down when performance tanks.</p><p>That means you're often left with a blurry, shimmery mess that just plain looks bad. None of these issues are surprising given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">PC and PSVR 2 reviews</a> of the game that often referred to bugs, crashes, and other visual and performance problems even after the patch that was supposed to fix them.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gevXCpd9yj7xsskmydqCoH" name="alien-rogue-incursion-gunplay" alt="Gameplay from Alien: Rogue Incursion on Meta Quest 3 shooting aliens with an assault rifle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gevXCpd9yj7xsskmydqCoH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>If Survios can get the visuals fixed in an upcoming patch, it'll have delivered on the promise of a truly stunning Alien game in VR.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Visually, the game simply doesn't look like it should be taxing the Meta Quest 3's hardware the way it does, and games like Genotype prove that this game should look <em>and</em> run a lot better than it does. Survios also changed some visual aspects of the game's art, like adding a blue haze to the Quest version to help hide the terrible pop-in problems when the geometry is loaded.</p><p>It's clear that whatever engine Survios is using needs to be swapped out for something else. Sure, this is a game that was developed for much higher-end hardware than a Quest, but, again, there's nothing visually in the Quest version that looks like it should perform this poorly when compared to plenty of other games.</p><p>In the end, Alien: Rogue Incursion is a brilliant game wrapped in a distractingly bad visual package. If you're willing to sideload <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://anagan79.itch.io/quest-games-optimizer">Quest Games Optimizer</a>, set the game to 120% resolution, CPU/GPU to high or ultra, and FFR to high. These settings completely fix both the resolution and performance problems at the expense of battery life, but that's why I have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/bobovr-m3-pro-review-meta-quest-3-headstrap">great Meta Quest 3 battery head strap</a>, after all.</p><p>Hopefully, Survios will address these visual issues in a promised upcoming patch, because the rest of the game deserves to be surfaced in a better way than this.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung recently spoke about its latest "AI Innovations" with One UI 7, which also came with a warning for past-gen devices.</p><p>Seeing as the Galaxy S25 series launched with One UI 7 (Android 15), Samsung's EVP and head of the Framework R&D, Sally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/id/samsung-ungkap-rahasia-di-balik-inovasi-ux-keamanan-dan-ai-di-galaxy">was interviewed </a>(Indonesia) about its features (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/one-ui-7-now-brief-not-release-older-galaxy-phones/">SamMobile</a>). While the company exec touched on the major user interface design changes and other One UI updates, one of the major highlights was its AI.</p><p>Specifically, when discussing "exclusive Galaxy S25 AI features," Sally mentioned that the software's AI is broken into two parts: hardware reliance and not.</p><p>Sally states One UI 7's "personal data engine" is a huge part of the OS, but it's a feature that utilizes on-device processing technology. It's this fact alone that forces a huge reliance on the strength of the chipset inside the phone. Sally states the personal data engine is made possible by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-announces-snapdragon-8-elite-soc-for-galaxy-s25-series">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a> and its capabilities to support such rigorous on-device processing.</p><p>Sally adds features like this "really require advanced chipsets and hardware like those found on the Galaxy S25 Series."</p><p>According to Sally, "more affordable devices" will likely miss out on "deeper on-device AI experiences" like the personal data engine, which creates a more personalized AI experience for users. Moreover, Samsung states "We strive to provide the best features according to the device's capabilities and user needs."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-beta-program-2" alt="One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zxVn5aMDEYed3Vtx6RXggF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, Sally didn't explain which features (and which past-gen phones) could lack the personal data engine. For context, the personal data engine <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">was described by Samsung</a> as "Galaxy's approach to AI personalization."The engine helps protect users' data when using its on-device software. It also remains to be seen if Samsung's lock screen Now Bar/Now Brief app info will be affected by hardware limitations.</p><p>This is a selection of curated app activities for users that can help get them started in the day or help them plan. Samsung states the Now Bar is designed to be an "insightful experience" that's deeply involved in the apps you use the most.</p><p>On a related note, One UI 7's AI limitations echo <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-ai-more-past-gen-confirmed">what happened with Galaxy AI's</a> main functions after the Galaxy S24's launch. Many of Samsung's older Galaxy S and Galaxy Z foldables were hit with AI restrictions due to the limitations of the hardware. Devices like the Galaxy S21, Flip 3, and Fold 3 were only able to receive two Galaxy AI features as their dated hardware couldn't handle much else.</p><p>We still have a ways to go until any Galaxy S device sees One UI 7, despite Samsung's confirmation that it was arriving "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-confirms-one-ui-7-galaxy-s-phones-rollout-soon">imminently</a>." However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-delayed-february-issues-reported">another beta</a> might befall the Galaxy S24 series before One UI 7 arrives officially.</p>

<ul><li>Meta-owned WhatsApp has introduced a couple of new features that make the messaging platform more colorful.</li><li>WhatsApp now has pre-set chat themes and backgrounds, which can be applied to all chats or individual chats.</li><li>The rollout of the new features has just begun on iOS and Android platforms; global roll out is expected in the coming weeks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Ever since WhatsApp’s inception for mobile devices, the messaging platform has carried its typical green color theme throughout the app, including its chat screens. Well, that is likely to change, as the company recently announced new colorful chat bubbles and wallpapers for the app.</p><p>WhatsApp already allows users to change chat wallpapers by providing notable colors and templates. However, as part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/chat-themes-to-reflect-your-style">announcement</a>, there are 30 new chat wallpapers to make the chat screen more diverse than it was before. However, the ability to choose your background from your phone’s gallery is still available.</p><p>The unique new feature aside from the wallpapers is the new chat theme option. It allows users to change the chat bubbles with relevant backgrounds — and it features some notable options to choose from. Up until now, chat bubbles were only green, and it looks like WhatsApp is catching up to the competition as they allow users to change themes, chat bubbles, and more like in Telegram, for example.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="tqeR3MUiT5jVaXtu6YZcVF" name="whatsapp-chat-theme-feature" alt="WhatsApp chat themes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tqeR3MUiT5jVaXtu6YZcVF.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: WhatsApp)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This means, that picking up any pre-set chat theme on WhatsApp will change both the background and chat bubble, which can further be mixed and matched to suit users’ personal preferences. Regardless of the chat theme, users can still change the background by uploading any image from their phone’s gallery.</p><p>Another notable thing to address is that these chat themes can be chat-specific or can be applied to all chats. Also, these themes are only visible to the user who set them and not to the recipient. Furthermore, a user can also change themes to their subscribed WhatsApp channels.</p><p>These new chat themes and wallpapers have just started to roll out to both iOS and Android platforms. The global availability is, however, expected in the coming weeks. Post which, a user can head to <em><strong>WhatsApp Settings> Chats> Default chat theme.</strong></em></p><p>For individual chat theme change, on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>: the user needs to open the specific chat go for the three-dot menu, and select chat theme. iOS users, on the other hand, can simply click on the chat name and look for the chat theme.</p>

<ul><li>Google is releasing the second beta of Android 16, and any supported Pixel device can run it.</li><li>The update is more substantial than the first beta, with camera and media updates.</li><li>The company is on track to release Android 16 publicly during its target of the second quarter in 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is releasing the second beta of Android 16 to Pixels enrolled in the Android Beta Program starting today, Feb. 13. The update comes a few weeks after the company released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Android 16 Beta 1</a> with minor changes largely indistinguishable to the average Android user. However, the just-released Android 16 Beta 2 packs a few notable new features and behavior changes, largely concerning media, camera, and graphics.</p><p>Specifically, Android 16 Beta 2 brings along features that will help improve Android cameras for professional users. It adds what Google calls a hybrid auto-exposure mode, which will let Android users employ a mix of manual and auto exposure when capturing a shot. Currently, users have to choose between full manual or full auto shooting modes on Android. With Android 16 Beta 2, they can control ISO or exposure time and use auto-exposure algorithms simultaneously.</p><p>The update also introduces support for fine color temperature and tint adjustments. There are only a few preset color temperature modification options currently available in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>, but Android 16 Beta 2 further adds "precise adjustments of white balance based on the correlated color temperature," according to Google.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16 Beta 2</a> has intent actions for motion photos — a combination of still images and short videos with audio — that developers can use. Developers can also determine exactly where the motion photo will be saved.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.92%;"><img id="mwuUGnzgcZh2AhjZMVW2cS" name="Google-HDR-Android-16" alt="Google is bringing UltraHDR support to HEIC-formatted images with Android 16 Beta 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mwuUGnzgcZh2AhjZMVW2cS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="712" height="626" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google is bringing UltraHDR support to HEIC-formatted images with Android 16 Beta 2. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That rounds out the camera changes, but Google is also improving image processing with Android 16 Beta 2. It's gaining support for UltraHDR photos formatted in HEIC, which is a lightweight and efficient file format. Eventually, Google is working on adding support for AVIF formatting for UltraHDR photos, too.</p><p>Android 16 Beta 2 features a few developer-focused behavior changes, like the removal of Android's edge-to-edge opt-out for apps, new Android health permissions, and intent redirect changes.</p>

<p>Android 16 Beta 2's release confirms Google is on track to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-new-android-16-release-schedule-and-why-it-matters">meet its new Android release schedule</a>. The operating system is reaching platform stability, which should occur next month. Android 16 will then be shipped publicly in the second quarter of 2025.</p><p>You can try out Android 16 Beta 2 by enrolling a supported Google Pixel phone — Pixel 6 series and newer — in the Android Beta Program <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">here</a>. From here on, the device will receive over-the-air (OTA) updates for future betas.</p>

<p>Now that Samsung's Galaxy S25 series is in the rear mirror,  the company is focusing on its non-flagship devices, which are probably going to launch soon, and new renders of the devices have now surfaced again — thanks to Evan Blass.</p><p>In a couple of shared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/p/ff1cba6c-fbc6-44b1-83e6-56116fdb8e23">Substack email links</a>, Blass has shared <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/p/dc4dbc5e-ee98-469f-9ae9-5349cd9fe474">new renders</a> of the upcoming Galaxy A56 and A36 devices, which give us a clear picture of what to expect from Samsung’s next mid-range devices — in terms of design. Per the new renders, both share identical designs featuring squared-off edges and rounded corners.</p>

The new design element was first ventured with the predecessor models dubbed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-galaxy-a55-and-a35">Galaxy A55 and A35</a> and was later carried to budget Galaxy models like the Galaxy A15 and A25 — back in 2023.</p><p>Going by last year’s models’ release date, the launch of the Galaxy A56 and A36 should likely be happening in the first week of March, which is a couple of weeks away. According to renders by Blass, the former could be coming in shades of pink, gray, and green, and the latter also in shades of gray, green, and possibly purple.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly pushing for bigger internal and external displays on the Fold 7, which could end up as 8-inches and 6.5-inches, respectively.</li><li>The company is also looking at removing the S Pen digitizer for the sake of a thinner phone that's roughly 0.6mm slimmer.</li><li>The latest report echoes display and digitizer rumors we've heard previously that claim the next S Pen could be slightly bulkier with a battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Additional information has supposedly come to light regarding Samsung's next Z Fold model.</p><p>A source from South Korean publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/13/latest-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-reiterate-thinner-design-bigger-screen-and-a-big-s-pen-change/">EtNews</a> claims Samsung is moving toward several hardware and S Pen changes for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/13/latest-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaks-reiterate-thinner-design-bigger-screen-and-a-big-s-pen-change/">9to5Google</a>). The post states the next Fold will feature a "larger display size" for its internal and external displays. The Fold 7 is rumored to sport an 8-inch and 6.5-inch screen, respectively. Curiously, the publication's sources suggest that the bigger screens will "make it easier" to reduce the thickness of the next foldable.</p><p>That's where the next portion of rumors come in as Samsung is — once again — reportedly ditching the S Pen digitizer.</p><p>The publication cites "multiple industry insiders," stating, "It has been decided that the digitizer will not be applied to the Fold 7." The purported changes don't appear to be drastic, as Samsung is allegedly looking to dip below 10mm in thickness for the Fold 7. Specifically, the post claims that removing the S Pen's digitizer could offer a (rough) 0.6mm reduction.</p><p>Samsung is also rumored to be looking at new ways of providing S Pen functions. The Korean OEM is allegedly looking at turning the S Pen into its own device that requires a battery to support its core functions.</p>

<p>A lot of what we're hearing today doubles down on previous rumors, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">ones from mid-January</a>. A YouTube report by a South Korean publication claimed that Samsung was looking at removing the digitizer for the S Pen, meaning it won't be stored within the phone. It's a change that would mirror what the company did with the Galaxy Z <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Fold 6 Special Edition</a>.</p><p>Without a digitizer, consumers would have to charge their S Pen since the device won't do so internally. This could cause the stylus to end up slightly larger and maybe a little bulkier than we're used to. Also, rumors from December add that Samsung could chase AES technology so the stylus could manage everything on its own without reliance on the Fold 7.</p><p>Rumors about the phone's displays continue, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-might-finally-give-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-the-screen-upgrades-they-need">doubling down on</a> two-month-old speculation. Tipsters on social media claimed Samsung could deliver an 8-inch main display and a 6.5-inch cover screen for the Fold 7. Those rumors touched on the FLip 7, too, stating it could feature a 6.85-inch foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen.</p><p>The Fold 7 is expected to debut later this year, likely sometime during the summer as usual.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Word on the streets is that Samsung's planning to launch a 'G Fold' multi-fold phone, also known as the "double-folding" foldable. This would expand the brand's current Galaxy Z family, going from a duo to a trio of diverse foldable form factors. Hurray for innovation, right? Well, based on rumors and alleged leaks from the weeks past, this seems counterproductive.</p><p>In case you haven't heard already, purported reports about Samsung's foldable sales and production numbers started surfacing around late December 2024. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s24-ultra-just-broke-new-ground-for-android-flagships">Galaxy S24 Ultra might be breaking records</a>, but the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 are headed in the opposite direction. Apparently, Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-foldable-unit-shipment-changes-report">Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 series sales</a> did not live up to the Korean smartphone maker's expectations. Based on this decline, Samsung is supposedly cutting down on production for the Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 series.</p><p>An alleged reduction of roughly three million foldable units produced is no small feat. This doesn't bode well for Samsung's slice of the foldable market at all, especially when taking their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discussed-foldable-sale-estimates-2024">original target of a 10% <em>increase</em></a> into account. And yet, the brand all but confirmed the multi-folding G Fold device at Galaxy Unpacked 2025.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This isn't the first time that Samsung has shown off its conceptual multi-fold phone. In fact, prototypes of the book-like Android device were shown off at CES 2025 in Las Vegas. What I am highly skeptical of at the moment isn't the existence of the device but rather the alleged release timeline.</p><p>If the rumors are true and Samsung launches the G Fold in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">second quarter of 2025</a>, there will be three Galaxy foldables launching this year and around the same time. Furthermore, the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> likely will not be very different from their predecessors, as other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-to-carry-z-fold-edition-features">leaks have pointed out</a>. In that case, it is highly likely that the downward trend in their sales will continue.</p><p>Even with scaled-back Z Fold 7 and Flip 7 production, Samsung will then have the G Fold to consider. If people are losing interest in these expensive Android devices, who's to say the multi-fold will sell well? Sure, it'll garner interest from hobbyists and enthusiasts, but the exorbitant price tag will likely prevent many of them from actually buying one.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA" name="samsung-unpacked-android-xr-triple-fold" alt="Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGyKNb3RmavuoSfaBqgTJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's not like the larger, more innovative, and experimental G Fold multi-fold phone can be expected to launch with a cheaper price tag either. After all, new technology is expensive. The first few years of sales alone are sometimes not enough to recuperate research and development costs.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy G Fold will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-name-change-hardware-specs-rumored">reportedly use Samsung Display's "newly developed display and film,"</a> which will be debuted at Mobile World Congress 2025 in Barcelona next month. Some tipsters have suggested that the G Fold launch could be delayed past Q2 2025 into Samsung's fall Unpacked event.</p><p>According to more hearsay, Samsung is only gunning for about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-tri-fold-flagship-foldable-production-rumors">200,000 units of the multi-fold phone</a>, playing it safe rather than taking a bold risk.</p><p>Samsung is starting to realize that its current portfolio of foldables has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-samsung-sorry-for-failing-to-innovate-or-just-sorry-sales-are-down">become very stale</a>. This is very clearly reflected in the numbers. Regardless of Samsung's hopes for the multi-fold, I don't think it will be enough to revive foldable sales.</p><p>At the end of the day, it'll all boil down to the price of the G Fold. Because, let's be honest — if the G Fold is priced anything like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">Huawei Mate XT tri-foldable</a>, no one's going to buy it.</p>

Many employees received notification earlier this week, giving them an hour to assemble any last-minute correspondence before access was cut off.</p><p>Hot on the heels of the layoff is news that Meta is rapidly rehiring many of these positions, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-job-cuts-everything-we-know-2025-2">Business Insider</a>, pivoting them to AI development. Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-q4-2024-earnings">latest earnings</a> show it's still mainly an ad-driven company, with over 3.3 billion people being served ads in some capacity across the company's many platforms. AI, it's said, will be the next major way to deliver ads in a more profound, personalized way.</p><p>But the amount of money Meta plans to spend on AI development in 2025 is staggering. Zuckerberg told investors the company plans to spend upwards of <strong>$65 billion</strong> on AI this year, citing it as a key component of the company's future revenue strategy.</p><p>To put that in perspective, Meta has spent roughly $60 billion on its Reality Labs division since 2019. Now, Meta wants to spend another $5 billion <em>more</em> than that on AI in one-fifth of the time. It's a huge shift in a company that has been spending billions on products and R&D over <em>years</em>, not months.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VupWtzxrgsqvh3TsJB6pRY" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-meta-ai-logo" alt="Talking to Meta AI on the limited edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VupWtzxrgsqvh3TsJB6pRY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta is looking to spend $5 billion more on AI in a single year than it has on Reality Labs in five years, and that screams of desperation.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>While Reality Labs has cost Meta lots of money over the years, the group has been turning healthy revenue numbers since 2020, which could outpace spending if Meta cuts down on R&D costs. Thus far, Reality Labs has offset its 5-year costs by pulling in nearly $10 billion in revenue. The revenue guidance for Reality Labs is straightforwar,d as the company mainly profits from the sales of devices, services, and apps sold on the Meta Horizon digital marketplace.</p><p>But the way Meta makes money on Meta AI isn't nearly as clear or straightforward. Meta has been injecting AI into every product and service it has, from products like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-glasses-just-got-their-most-futuristic-ai-update-yet">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a> and the Meta Quest 3 to apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-ai-apps-llama-3-launch">Instagram and WhatsApp</a>. Zuckerberg told investors last April that Meta AI will primarily make the company money through ad revenue.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://stratechery.com/2024/metas-ai-abundance/#:~:text=Meta%20is%20the%20best%20positioned,exactly%20the%20business%20goals%20requested.">Stratechery</a> notes, this is done through enhanced machine learning techniques — using AI to better understand Meta's customer base and serve even more personalized ads to it — as well as generative visuals targeted toward specific customers. In other words, Meta AI is being used as an ad delivery vehicle, not a product in the traditional sense.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg" name="meta-ai-logo-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-in-front-01" alt="A Meta AI logo on a laptop with a pair of Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses in front" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AMDmQ7j9FheNMVoBMDTpCg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta AI is being used as a way to deliver more personalized ads to customers, helping to ensure the company's leadership in the ad space.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But Meta's strategy for getting AI into its products feels disconnected. Thousands of Meta employees are now jobless after receiving positive performance reviews, made even worse by the company publicly calling them "low performers." Everyone from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7294830526815776768-FwUu?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAoQqMEBGui-dYKqGmXEy1Qur2F_KQPezeQ" target="_blank">Instagram product designers</a> to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/christianbourdeau_opentowork-dataengineering-ai-activity-7295109354540646400-nacJ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAoQqMEBGui-dYKqGmXEy1Qur2F_KQPezeQ" target="_blank">fledgling data engineers</a> and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elana-reman-safner-7098003a/" target="_blank">longer-term product counselors</a> are part of the layoffs, and many cite having received no warning ahead of yesterday's notice.</p><p>It's true that Zuckerberg did give <em>some</em> advanced notice of upcoming layoffs, but the CEO said that the company would be laying off "low performers" during January 29th's earnings call — not employees that just received positive performance reviews. The surprise is deepened further by the company's earning reports, which showed a record $48 billion in revenue, a 21% increase over the previous year.</p><p>Per internal memos obtained by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-tells-managers-how-performance-based-job-cuts-will-work-2025-1">Business Insider</a>, managers were to identify between 12% and 15% of their employees to be labeled as "low performers." This comes after the previous round of layoffs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-social-media-reality-labs-layoffs-2024">in October 2024</a>, cutting each of the company's departments by another 7-10% to meet the goals outlined by Zuckerberg. Employees who spoke with Business Insider noted that a culture of anxiety and fear had swept through the company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6sAMbrv583rRDcJ2xtpndm" name="meta-quest-3-with-kiwi-design-h4-head-strap" alt="A Meta Quest 3 headset with a Kiwi Design H4 head strap on top of a journal with the Great Wave off Kanagawa painting on the cover" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6sAMbrv583rRDcJ2xtpndm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Meta's strategy going forward is to blitz-hire AI engineers in place of employees who were just laid off.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>To make matters worse, Zuckerberg said that the company would be "backfilling these roles this year," meaning folks laid off this week will likely have their roles replaced by the year's end. It screams short-term thinking without considering long-term repercussions, something the tech industry has been guilty of as it began mass layoffs across the sector a few years ago.</p><p>It's said that Meta's strategy now is to blitz-hire AI engineers to ensure the company is a leader in the AI space. Our current understanding of the company's strategy is that the backfilled roles will pivot to AI development instead of their previous scope, ensuring that Meta's upcoming hires are laser-focused on the company's latest goal.</p><p>Meta's CFO, Susan Li, directly addressed the hiring process in the recent earnings call. "In 2025, we expect headcount growth will continue to be primarily driven by technical roles across our priority initiatives within infrastructure, monetization, Reality Labs, generative AI, as well as regulation and compliance. We anticipate headcount growth in our business functions will remain relatively limited."</p><p>This leaves even more uncertainty in the wake of several rounds of layoffs during 2023 and 2024 despite Meta labeling only 2023 as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-q4-2022-earnings">year of efficiency</a>." Now, even good employees with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7295104279135043584/">track record of excellence</a> are being replaced to further a single, specific goal.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bzGaadkTzHKPHxpUNQDdx3" name="meta-ai-generated-mark-zuckerberg-photos" alt="Four selections of Meta AI-generated images of Mark Zuckerberg hooked up to computer terminals with wires" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bzGaadkTzHKPHxpUNQDdx3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While Meta's strategy seems dubious from many angles, the company deserves credit for its generous severance packages. Impacted folks were given "16 weeks of pay and an additional two weeks for every year of service," according to two folks who spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-speeds-up-ai-hiring-while-cutting-thousands-low-performers-2025-2">Business Insider</a>. A similar amount of severance pay was offered to laid-off workers during several other rounds of lay-offs, according to people I had previously spoken with.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>If profits only continue to go up, isn't it madness to get rid of the people who made that possible? IT certainly seems so to me.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>And Meta's moves are certainly helping stock owners profit from a heightened valuation. Meta stock is up 200 points (roughly 40%) since October when the latest string of layoffs began. If anything, the company's strategy is resonating well with investors who believe the company to be on the right track.</p><p>But how much of this will come back to bite Meta in the proverbial butt? Ousting employees with positive performance reviews feels underhanded unless decisions are being made for financial reasons. Given how well Meta has been doing and how much money the company continues to rake in, this is certainly not the case.</p><p>Bleeding talent is a huge problem across the tech sector and certainly not siloed to Meta, but one wonders why the company can't simply hire more AI engineers and keep the rest of the employees onboard during the process. After all, if profits only continue to go up, isn't it madness to get rid of the people who made that possible? It certainly seems so to me.</p>

<p>OnePlus is leaving the foldables scene, at least for this year. In a community<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1652471315484901379"> blog post </a>on their foldable strategy, Vale G, a OnePlus product manager, said the company is 'recalibrating their foldable strategy' and confirmed that it will be holding off on launching a OnePlus Open 2.</p><p>The company's first foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open,</a> debuted in 2023 and continues to be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldables</a> on the market today. This explains the enthusiasm around the next edition of this foldable. But it looks like fans will have to wait.</p><p>"At OnePlus, our core strength and passion lie in setting new benchmarks and challenging the status quo across all product categories. With that in mind, we’ve carefully considered the timing and our next steps in foldable devices, and we have made the decision not to release a foldable this year," the community post explained.</p><p>OnePlus and OPPO are sister companies, and the two share <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-announces-deeper-integration-oppo-promises-faster-updates" target="_blank">combined hardware and research teams,</a> as well as a common software codebase. It looks like the focus is now fully on launching the world's thinnest foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-global-launch-february-20-2025">OPPO Find N5</a>, in the next couple of weeks. That said, OpenPlus doesn't fully rule out the possibility of launching Open 2 in the future.</p><p>"While this may come as a surprise, we believe this is the right approach for us at this time. That said, our decision to pause on foldable for this generation does not signify a departure from the category," the community post added.</p><p>The company also adds that nothing changes for the current OnePlus Open users as they will continue to receive all "the software updates security patches, and the exceptional after-sales service you’ve come to expect from us."</p><p>While we don't know for sure what made the company take this stance, it looks like the software advancements that were supposed to debut in the Open 2 will now be seen in OPPO’s Find N5. Not only will it be the thinnest foldable yet, but the device is said to demonstrate advancements in foldable technology, "including the use of cutting-edge new materials and more sophisticated engineering."</p><p>It remains to be seen if the move was right for OnePlus as it takes a step back this year.</p>

Additionally, this deal is available in all five headphone color options, which is a worthwhile decision if you're going to spend a chunk of change on premium headphones.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant downside to the Momentum 4 headphones is the fact that they only feature three-band equalization controls, rather than offering eight to 10 like many brands.  This may be a dealbreaker for those who want advanced EQ controls through their headphone's mobile app, but given that most phones today include their own onboard equalization this shouldn't be much of an issue for most users.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is refreshing the design of the Family Link app and bringing a few features introduced for kid-friendly Wear OS watches to Android phones, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/families/family-link-updates-february-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, Feb. 12. The user-interface shakeup splits the Family Link for Android app into three main pages: Screen Time, Controls, and Location. The new look for Family Link is designed to make it easier for parents to manage multiple children and devices, Google explains.</p><p>With the fresh UI, the Screen Time page shows a breakdown of a child's device and app usage. Parents can also create or manage Downtime and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-school-time-parental-android-feature-detailed">School time restrictions</a> from this page. Basically, everything Screen Time related is now organized cleanly in one place, no matter how many devices or kids you have.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Controls page is the home for changing account data settings, approving app downloads, and blocking specific websites, according to the company. This includes individual options for managing a child's parental controls for YouTube, Google Search, and other apps or services. At the top of the screen, there's an oval that shows which child's profile you're currently viewing, which also lets you swipe between them.</p><p>Finally, the Location page is exactly what it sounds like — it's a map showing your child's last-updated location, device battery life, and cellular connection.</p>

<p>Google made waves when it introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-ace-lte-review">Fitbit Ace LTE</a>, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-kids-smartwatch">kid-friendly smartwatch</a>. More recently, it helped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-and-google-teamed-up-on-new-galaxy-watch-7-experience-for-kids">Samsung make the Galaxy Watch for Kids</a>. Both of these efforts helped make smartwatches available for children, and created new parental control options for parents.</p><p>One of those features is School time, which is a parental control option intended to reduce distractions from smartwatches during school hours. Now, Google is bringing that same feature to Android phones with Family Link starting next week. School time can be customized by parents to limit phone features, silence notifications, block certain apps, and report which apps kids are using while they're at school.</p><p>Additionally, the Galaxy Watch for Kids was the first Wear OS smartwatch to support parent-managed contacts. This feature will come to Android phones "in the coming months," which will let parents restrict calls and texts made by their child only to contacts they've approved.</p><p>School time and parent-managed contacts are the latest Family Link feature set to come to Android phones after starting on watches. Last year, Google announced plans to make <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-for-kids-support-2025">Google Wallet available to kids</a> in a limited fashion.</p><p>If you're just learning about Family Link for the first time, we have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-create-google-account-your-kid-through-family-link">the complete guide for how to get started here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>The Apple TV app is officially available on Android as of now, so Android users no longer have to use a browser to stream Apple TV Plus content.</li><li>Apple TV on Android uses Google Play Billing, so users can subscribe via the Google Play Store without needing an Apple device. This change also applies to the Android TV or Google TV apps.</li><li>The Apple TV app for Android is for accessing Apple TV Plus or MLS Season Pass; it can't be used to access purchased iTunes content.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Over five years after launching the Apple TV Plus streaming service, the company is finally bringing the Apple TV app to Android. Starting today, Feb. 12, users can download the Apple TV app from the Google Play Store and access the Apple TV Plus and MLS Season Pass subscription offerings. The move comes after Apple previously made an Apple TV app for the Android TV and Google TV platforms back in 2021.</p><p>The new Apple TV app will run on devices with Android 10 or newer installed, and that includes a mix of phones, tablets, and foldables. Unlike the Apple TV app on Apple devices, the Apple TV app for Android will not offer certain features, like access to iTunes content or Apple TV channels. Instead, this app focuses on Apple's streaming services.</p><p>The Android version of the app is built to be cross-platform, with features like "Continue Watching." You can start a show or movie on one device and pick up right where you left off on another, regardless of whether that's an Apple or Android device.  Additionally, users can plan out their streaming with a "Watchlist," and can download Apple TV Plus content to their Android device for offline watching.</p><p>Notably, Apple is now integrating with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/xbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling">Google Play Billing</a>. This means that Android users can sign up for Apple TV Plus on an Apple device or on the web, but they can also do so through the Google Play Store directly in the Android app. This is a first for Apple, as the Apple TV app for Android/Google TV did not support signing up for the streaming service in the app — until now.</p><p>Apple says the app is designed for Android, bringing a "familiar and intuitive interface," but there are some missing features that longtime Android users might miss. For example, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast">Google Cast</a> isn't available at launch, so you can't cast a show from the Apple TV app on your Android phone to your Google TV, Nest, or Chromecast device. The company plans to build and improve the Apple TV app for Android over time, and Google Cast is the kind of feature that could be added in the future.</p><p>The two streaming services available on the Apple TV app for Android are Apple TV Plus (which includes Friday Night Baseball) and MLS Season Pass. Apple TV Plus costs $9.99 per month, and includes hit shows like <em>Severance</em> and <em>Ted Lasso</em>, as well as Friday Night Baseball — which airs two MLB games weekly during the regular season with no regional blackouts. There's also MLS Season Pass, the all-access streaming service for Major League Soccer, which costs $14.99 per month or $99 for the entire season.</p><p>Android users can download the Apple TV app from the Google Play Store starting now. This was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/news-weekly-october-12-2024">previously rumored back in October</a>, and of course, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-android-integrates-songshift-feature">the Apple Music app for Android</a> has been around for about a decade.</p><p>You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">try Apple TV Plus for free</a> for seven days.</p>

You have big phones that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">fold open</a>, cheap phones that are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">built tough</a>, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-android-oems-can-improve-flip-phones">flippy phones</a> that get pocket-sized. There is something for everyone, even if you're not interested in "just another glass slab."</p><p>These phones also come with an array of features and price points. If you want a good camera, you can have one. If you want something fast and able to play games, you can have it. If you want both, you can have that too. The choices seem endless and that's good for us all; we both get exactly what we want. There's something we both need, though, even if we didn't know we needed it: a battery that's easily replaced.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-12" alt="Battery activity results on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XxyfiGCNgNsQ2HTyRyJeVK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The batteries inside consumer electronics are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">disposable by design</a>. A battery that lasts a decade or longer could be built, but the costs would be astronomical, so almost everything you buy that's battery-powered comes with a battery that's disposable by design.</p><p>This is because today's "battery science" allows manufacturers to build a battery that's efficient and easy to charge while still being relatively cheap to make but doesn't have a very long lifespan. I'm not talking about the time between charges or your phone being able to last the full day on a single charge — I mean how long that battery is able to be charged and used.</p>
<p>Battery life is measured in charge cycles and not days or weeks, but you can say the battery inside a phone is designed to last about two years of normal use. Two years is forever in the tech world, and something bigger, stronger, and faster <em><strong>will</strong></em> come out by then, and you <em><strong>will</strong></em> want it. However, the rest of your phone is built to last a lot longer than two years. The life of a modern smartphone is dictated by how long a phone maker is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/fairphone-2-receives-stable-android-10">willing to provide support</a> and how long the battery will last.</p><p>If Samsung (for example) would still offer software support and provide replacement batteries, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-you-think-galaxy-s10-still-worth-buying">Galaxy S10</a> could be a fantastic phone for a lot of people in 2025. But it does neither, so you've probably moved on by now.</p>
<p>I'm not picking on Samsung. They've actually made a huge advancement on this front with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review" target="_blank">Galaxy S25,</a> and one of its best features that nobody (well, almost nobody — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/108201/galaxy-s25-ultra-teardown-quick-battery-fix-slow-progress-on-repairability" target="_blank">thanks, iFixit!</a>) talks about is how easy it is to replace the battery.</p>
<h2 id="you-can-t-change-it-but-someone-else-can-2">You can't change it but someone else can</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J4EVadpV_ew" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>A phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> or even something more user-serviceable like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hmd-skyline-offers-something-other-phones-dont">HMD Skyline</a> doesn't magically give you some super secret technician powers. You'll probably never tear your phone apart on the kitchen table and change its battery. That's fine; we're expected to be consumers and users, not field techs.</p><p>But there is always someone who can do it. Your local carrier store might have repair techs or maybe there is a shop at the local strip mall beside that Mongolian barbeque joint that fixes things like phones and PlayStations. Even a super complicated and difficult-to-repair phone can be serviced by someone determined and qualified.</p><p>This isn't a good option for most of us because of one thing: the cost. Spending $250 to fix an old phone seems dumb when you can buy a new one for $99 down and $20 a month in the eyes of most people. So when the battery in a phone that is otherwise good as new finally wears out, we just buy a new one.</p>
<p>This is a mindset that needs to change. I'm not suggesting that everyone thinks as I do — I used my old BlackBerry until I couldn't find parts for it on eBay because I'm cheap — but it's simply not disposable when something costs upwards of $1,000. Maintenance should be done so the product can continue to be used.</p>

<p>Think of changing the battery in your phone like an oil change for a car or truck. Older models were easy — turn a wrench to drain the old oil or pop off the back cover to remove an old battery and replace what needs to be replaced. Anyone can do it, and it only takes a few minutes.</p><p>Newer phones (and newer cars) require a bit more skill to service and you're likely to take them to someone else so it can be done right. The price you will pay for that service depends on how hard it is to perform; getting another two years of life from a product like a phone can be so expensive that we don't want to do it.</p>
<p>This is why products that have a serviceable battery inside are important, even 100% mainstream products like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> of phones. You might not tear it apart on the coffee table, but knowing someone else can do it cheaply is one of the best features the S25 has to offer.</p>

<p>The upcoming OnePlus Watch 3 is tapped to last five days per charge, and while we don't know its price yet, you can bet it'll cost much less than the Apple or Galaxy Watch Ultra while lasting much longer. It's time for OnePlus to light a fire under some big-name toes.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-detailed-ahead-of-launch">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will officially launch on February 18 with some significant changes over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a>: a new titanium bezel, a rotating crown that's functional instead of decorative, a faster and more efficient coprocessor, and an "optimized" GPS antenna.</p><p>What matters most is that OnePlus squeezed another day of battery life for standard use (120 vs. 100 hours) and heavy use (72 vs. 48 hours) from the same Snapdragon W5 processor within a year. Pretty impressive!</p><p>Its 631mAh capacity — a 131mAh generational boost — isn't that different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">Mobvoi TicWatch Enduro</a> and Atlas (628mAh), but those are both rated for 90 hours and use a very limited Essential mode to achieve extended battery life. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a> aren't that far behind at 590mAh and 564mAh, respectively, but they only last 60 or 36 hours with typical use.</p><p>What trick did OnePlus use to pull off this gap? Most of the credit goes to the new battery tech that it recycled from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, but I think we should pay just as much attention to its new "BES2800" coprocessor — because it'll make or break the OnePlus Watch 3 experience. And I wonder if other brands will try to emulate OnePlus's method of success.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dBYJfhbnL57NjYhHKDeBR9" name="oneplus-watch-2-8.jpg" alt="OnePlus Watch 2 lying across OnePlus 12" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBYJfhbnL57NjYhHKDeBR9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Any Wear OS watch will use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/what-is-the-new-wear-os-hybrid-interface">Wear OS Hybrid Interface</a>; it relegates low-power, background tasks like heart rate and notifications to the mobile coprocessing unit (MCU) to save battery life and leave the main, power-hungry cores dormant until they're needed for apps. But it was OnePlus that really harnessed that power on the OnePlus Watch 2 with its RTOS-running BES2700.</p><p>As effective as this system was for longevity, our reviewer found last year that this 12nm chipset seemed too slow to properly handle messages and sensor data with the same speed and reliability we're used to with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a>.</p><p>With the Watch 3, the main SoC is unchanged for Wear OS tasks, but now we have a 6nm BES2800 that OnePlus says will "ensure an optimal balance between long battery life and intelligent functionality."</p><p>With great power, paradoxically, comes greater efficiency. We saw with last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> how it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/why-snapdragon-8-elite-doesnt-need-efficiency-cores-to-last-longer">didn't need efficiency cores</a> because higher-clocked chips can hit the same benchmarks with significantly less power.</p><p>Our OnePlus Watch 3 review will be the real test, but we can assume these background RTOS tasks will now run with better efficiency on a 6nm chip than on a 12nm one. The question is, will other brands follow suit? Most current Wear OS watches have 22nm MCUs, which feels well short of the mark. But hardware aside, I wonder if relying on RTOS for certain tasks is something other watch brands should emulate.</p>
<h2 id="extra-capacity-and-curious-lab-results-2">Extra capacity and curious lab results</h2>
<p>Smartwatches can only fit so much battery capacity before the design becomes too bulky for anyone to wear. That's why we've heard so much chatter recently about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/samsungs-game-changing-wearable-battery-life-upgrade-could-arrive-next-year-and-even-the-apple-watch-could-benefit">Samsung and Apple using solid-state batteries</a>: They can't increase capacity without turning off fans of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-held-a-smartwatch-beauty-pageant-with-surprising-results">skinny, pretty watches</a>, so they're biding their time for a denser battery with a higher Wh/L.</p><p>While they twiddle thumbs and wait for this unproven tech, OnePlus has stuck its mobile Silicon NanoStack Battery into its watch. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon</a> or standard lithium-ion battery shares the same cathode, but the former mixes silicon and graphite for the anode, making these batteries more dense and resilient against extreme weather conditions.</p><p>A 22% capacity boost is nothing to sneeze at, but even without a spec sheet, we can assume the OnePlus Watch 3 will be heavy. One of our Watch 2 complaints was the absence of a smaller, lighter model, and it doesn't seem like that's changed here.</p><p>Wearing a Watch 3 won't be for the small-wristed, and it's fair to ask how far its battery would go with the halved capacity as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3 41mm</a> (306mAh) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 40mm</a> (300mAh).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7" name="OnePlus-Watch-2-vs-Google-Pixel-Watch-2-wearing-01.jpg" alt="The OnePlus Watch 2 and Pixel Watch 2 worn on left and right wrists" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TxCrE5NDybCNSrfW872aV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Bigger watch = more room for a bigger battery </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also fair to point out that OnePlus's five-day estimate has some odd caveats. The laboratory conditions had the tester only getting 6.5 hours of sleep per day, streaming music to earbuds for 15 minutes, taking one five-minute call per day, and only using watch apps for about 20 minutes per day. And it assumes the phone-watch Bluetooth connection will be disabled for 10 hours a day, for some reason.</p><p>Even the "heavy use" scenario keeps the GPS workouts, music streaming, phone calls, and other applications fairly short and limited. For comparison, the Apple Watch Ultra 2's official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/watch/battery/">36-hour estimate</a> includes 8 hours of LTE connection, double the GPS and music streaming and more clock checks. It feels less like they were stretching the battery life for marketing purposes.</p><p>Still, it doesn't <em>really</em> matter to me if the OnePlus Watch 3 perfectly hits five days or loses a day or two with real-world activity. What matters more is having that leeway built in, counterbalancing the inevitable loss of capacity you see on watches after a couple of years.</p>

<p>Last year was already a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-2024-retrospective">strong year for Wear OS</a> because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> put a big emphasis on battery life efficiency with current hardware. But 2025 could be even more significant because it's the year we may finally get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon Wear chip</a>.</p><p>Qualcomm's VP of wearables said the company's objective is to aim for "a week's worth of battery life" using Snapdragon chips. He further suggested that a combination of custom cores and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-is-risc-v">RISC-V software</a> could help Android watches trend in that direction.</p><p>But even before this paradigm shift, OnePlus is pushing the current Snapdragon hardware as far as it can go, and I think that other brands will take more notice than you might think.</p>
<p>OnePlus doesn't really compete with most other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android smartwatch</a> brands in North America and Europe; <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prAP52895124">IDC's latest report</a> shows a vast majority of OnePlus & OPPO watches were sold in China. But it still hit nearly 8 million sold in three months, only a few million short of Samsung.</p><p>Apple Watches have a big Chinese market presence, but they've fallen short of Huawei and have Xiaomi and Oppo/OnePlus chasing them from behind. Even if Apple has a complacent stranglehold on the U.S. market, it can't stand pat with its 18-hour battery life if its Chinese rivals start making this look totally inadequate.</p><p>And if Apple makes a battery life push, Samsung (and its partner Google) will focus on keeping its lead and making Android watches sound superior on paper, even if they fall short in sales.</p><p>That's why, even if the OnePlus Watch 3 — and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/oppo-details-watch-x2-big-display-leap-for-oneplus-watch-3_id167501">OPPO Watch X2</a>, its sibling/clone with near-identical specs — feel like niche products here, I predict that they'll kick off a smartwatch arms race (pun intended) and nudge the bigger brands out of their battery life complacency. None of them want to look deficient and behind the times.</p>

<ul><li>iFixit posted a complete teardown of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which showcased the ease users would find repairing/replacing its battery.</li><li>The video extends credit to the phone's triple camera array as Samsung provided multiple modules, meaning each lens can be repaired separately.</li><li>Despite the phone receiving a fair score, the difficulties concerning its screen repairability are striking.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's latest Galaxy S Ultra model is taken apart in an iFixit video to determine its level of repairability.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4EVadpV_ew&ab_channel=iFixit">posted a video</a> of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra's</a> repairability, which showcased a few notable surprises. To begin, iFixit started by removing the back panel. According to iFixit, Samsung recommends that users conducting self-repair or other business apply heat before doing so. However, the back panel was removed using a strong clamp tool — though heat would likely make it much easier, per the video.</p><p>The teardown commends Samsung's efforts at improving the repairability of its battery as users won't have to grapple with auxiliary tools to remove it. The battery is held in place by four, sticky pull tabs. After those are removed, the battery literally "falls out."</p><p>Next is the slightly redesigned triple camera array. This received high marks due to Samsung's usage of "multiple modules" for the trio. iFixit states that if one camera becomes damaged, a repair center can fix it without having to chuck it away and redo the entire set.</p><p>Overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra received a fair score of 5 out of 10 on iFixit's repairability scale. The video specifically notes the difficulties around removing the Galaxy S25 Ultra's OLED display, which comes with a warning: don't remove it "unless it's already broken."</p><p>You watch iFixit's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4EVadpV_ew&ab_channel=iFixit">complete teardown</a> of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, which goes in-depth about the internal changes to the S Pen and other repairable features.</p>

<p>On a related note, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-more-repairable-but-iphone-16-pro-wins/">Android Police</a> highlighted iFixit's statement, which calls the S25 Ultra the "most repair-friendly" Galaxy phone. Despite it being the most "friendly," there are clearly some issues Samsung needs to fix. Moreover, the publication also notes that while the Galaxy S25 Ultra improved in some areas, it still falls short of the 7 out of 10 score iFixit gave the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>Shortly after the S24 Ultra launched last year, PBKReviews <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pbkreviews-teardown-for-samsung-galaxy-s24">conducted its teardown</a> of the device. While different places have different opinions, PBK gave the past-gen Ultra a 9 out of 10 repairability score. That video specifically highlighted Samsung's usage of pull tabs for the battery and how "easy" it is to access its screen and charging port for repairs.</p><p>Curiously though, PBK did state how difficult it was to remove the display "without damaging it." The teardown didn't appear to apply heat and only utilized a clamp tool with several other tools wedged beneath the screen to lift it.</p><p>It's worth noting that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">iFixit cut ties with Samsung</a> last spring as its repairability goals were misaligned. Much like the Galaxy S25 Ultra, iFixit highlighted how Samsung's products are "too glued together," which made it hard for the former to deliver the parts home repair consumers would need without a price spike.</p><p>iFixit made it clear that it would still attempt to obtain Galaxy product parts when it could; however, guides for home repair will no longer be made.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly pushing an update for Maps on Android Auto that adds four new roadside hazards caused by the weather.</li><li>The options include low visibility, unplowed road, flooded road, and object on road.</li><li>Last year, Google updated the incident reporting experience in Maps on Android Auto, adding shared reports from Waze and a generalized "police" choice.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly pushed a quiet update for Maps, bringing a few more road safety alert options.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-adding-more-options-for-reporting-road-incidents/">Android Police</a> spotted the latest Maps alerts, involving road or roadside dangers caused by the weather. Specifically, the publication discovered four new options in Maps when reporting "incidents." Those choices are: low visibility, unplowed road, flooded road, and "object on road."</p><p>Each option deals with a particular weather occurrence, such as thick early morning fog, torrential rainfall, and the after-effects of a snowstorm. However, the "object on road" choice could help drivers point out more than just a downed tree branch following a storm. Users could use it to report items that could puncture their tire and more to keep their fellow drivers safe.</p><p>While the post points out that these four options have joined the broader "report and accident" menu on Android Auto, it's not everywhere yet. It seems as though Maps is getting this in waves, giving drivers the options first.</p><p>The post claims the reporting options haven't appeared properly on Android devices, yet users on iOS are supposedly "slowly" receiving them.</p>

<p>Reporting-wise, Google has dropped a couple of updates for Maps to improve the experience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-it-easier-to-report-police-spottings-in-maps">like one for police</a>. In November, Maps refined the way users could report police activity. The incident report was previously classified as "speed trap;" however, Google renamed it "police" to generalize all roadside activity. The app on Android Auto now conveniently features the "police" option at the top of the incident list, beside "crash," "slowdown," and "construction."</p><p>More importantly, Google and Waze joined forces last summer to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-making-your-commute-less-sucky-with-new-traffic-and-parking-helpers">share incident reports</a> for drivers. The collaboration <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-is-getting-smarter-with-wazes-help">appeared more widely</a> for drivers in December. If shared from Waze, users will see the alert appear on their in-dash display with a tag confirming where it's from. Users can "confirm" the report, giving it some street cred when others see a report of police activity or a roadside hazard.</p><p>Google hasn't forgotten its Android phones as Maps rolled out an update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-new-update-helps-you-plan-your-holidays-and-skip-the-crowds">for weather-related delays</a> last fall. Users traveling — at any point in time — can take advantage of how the weather could impact their travels and the city's local transit systems.</p>

<p>Users tuning into YouTube TV's live channels are noticing a few notable offerings are missing, but it looks like the company is on it.</p><p>A Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/thread/324513108">community manager</a> highlighted several of YouTube TV's usual free channel providers are suffering issues on the platform (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/12/youtube-tv-outage-cbs-cw-telemundo-fix/">9to5Google</a>). According to the post, the outage affects channels provided by Telemundo, CBS, and the CW. These issues have disrupted TV viewing for users from the east to the west coast.</p><p>Users chimed in, interacting with Google's official post, confirming the problem further. However, some users reported that the issues started well before Google jumped on it.  The post went up toward the evening of February 11, yet one user claims the problems (for them) began one day prior.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtubetv/thread/324513108?hl=en&msgid=324538246">Another user</a> with access to KOTV-DT in the Oklahoma region reported the channel's outage began yesterday morning.</p><p>Curiously, the folks at 9to5 spotted an update by a YouTube TV member <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubetv/comments/1ing4v6/comment/mccj39t/">on Reddit</a>, stating "This has been fixed. Let me know if you're still having issues." This was in response to a user who was trying to access CBS but could not. The YouTube TV member's update was shared early this morning, yet the official Google post has not been updated — which it said it would.</p><p>For now, continue to check to see if you can access the following Telemundo, CBS, and CW channels involved in the outage:</p>
<ul><li>KOTVDT</li><li>KQCWDT</li><li>KXGN</li><li>WNOLDT</li><li>KGWN</li><li>WTVRDT</li><li>KXLH</li><li>WWTV</li><li>WFQXDT2</li><li>WDNI</li></ul>

<p>Hopefully, these issues will be corrected soon as YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-wants-to-use-machine-learning-to-figure-out-whos-lying-about-their-age">laid out its plans</a> to continue its TV presence in a recent blog post. The platform turned 20 years old and to celebrate, it detailed what's next for 2025. YouTube highlighted that TVs have become the primary way users interact with the platform and view content.</p><p>Elsewhere, YouTube talked about its "big bets" for the year, which include "algorithmically" estimating a user's age on the platform. The platform already includes several safety rails for managing a user's age to avoid seeing unwanted content. Parents can also deploy a few parental controls to help keep things within a comfortable scope.</p><p>YouTube did not elaborate <em>on </em>its plan to do this, but we will likely see the results later this year.</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phone-under-100">$100 Android phone</a> might sound too good to be true, but that's exactly what the NUU N10 is. This impossibly cheap phone comes with Android 14 and Gemini baked in, plus it has zero bloatware. I was offered the opportunity to test the device, and I thought, how bad could it possibly be? Only one way to find out — by using it.</p><p>Thus, use it I did.</p><p>I was fully prepared for an entirely abhorrent experience with the NUU N10. When a company refuses to disclose the name of the phone's processor, one can only assume they are ashamed of it. But the spec sheet isn't all trash, and even a no-name 1.6GHz octa-core processor can perform well enough.</p><p>Throughout my testing, I felt the need to periodically remind myself that this phone costs just $100. It mitigated a lot of my harsh judgment because, really, how much can (or should) you expect for that amount of money?</p>

<p>Put the price tag aside for a few seconds, and hear me out. The NUU N10 comes with some generous screen real estate, boasting a large 6.6-inch IPS LCD screen with an HD+ resolution and a 90Hz refresh rate. A higher screen refresh rate really helps improve the snappiness of the phone, even if it's not the sharpest tool in the shed.</p><p>The body of the phone has a nice weightiness to it and the soft matte back paired with the silver metal frame looks modern and attractive. Unfortunately, the rear is very obviously made of plastic and feels uncomfortably flimsy. There's no in-screen fingerprint reader, but that's fine because the side-mounted one inside the power button works wonderfully well.</p><p>Accompanying the N10's mammoth 5,000mAh battery supports 18W USB-C fast charging, with a Type-A-to-C cable and a 10W power brick in the box. The 3.5mm headphone jack, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> slot for expanding the 128GB onboard storage, and dual SIM slots are a nice touch, seeing as most flagship phones ditched this golden trio several generations ago.</p><p>NUU tied it all together by providing everything a user could need in the box, starting from basics like a cable and SIM card removal tool to extras like a phone case and power adapter.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jviuYJc5pFi6VQfC2ycwbd" name="NUU N10" alt="NUU N10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jviuYJc5pFi6VQfC2ycwbd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unlike past NUU models, the N10 favors the full-fledged Android 14 over the lighter Android Go version of the OS, probably because it has 4GB of RAM, which can be extended to 8GB by using local storage via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ram-boost-explained">virtual RAM</a>.</p><p>It's not much, but NUU promises one year of software updates for all of its phones. As mentioned earlier, the phone comes with absolutely no bloatware pre-installed, nor does it have ads. Overall, the stock <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> experience is very neat and clean.</p><p>Frills such as water or dust resistance IP ratings and support for CDMA carriers are missing here. You can still use the NUU N10 on GSM carriers like T-Mobile and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-mvno-carrier">MVNOs like Mint Mobile or Tello</a>.</p>

<p>Let's be real; it's practically impossible for something this affordable to be an all-rounder. NUU would have to lose money for that to happen. So, while there are many winning characteristics of the N10, there's a lot to feel icky about as well.</p><p>Plastic body aside, the display just doesn't get bright enough. You'll really struggle with outdoor usage, especially in the daytime with the sun shining mightily.</p><p>Then there's the speaker setup, which defies common sense. The NUU N10 has bottom-firing speakers that sound awful, with warbled audio that is almost completely muffled by the user's hand when in landscape orientation.</p><p>The mic doesn't yield any better results either, failing to capture the full range of vocals but somehow picking up background noises and occasional echoes.</p><p>I could have forgiven all these crimes to a certain extent, but it's crazy that the NUU N10 only comes with one 13MP primary camera and a useless 2MP macro lens. The main lens is godawful at its job.</p>

<p>The so-called "AI" camera does nothing for picture quality, which is lacking in detail, depth, and color balance. Forget about capturing shots in the spur of the moment because the N10's camera gives you blurry shots even if you blink too aggressively. The 5MP front camera isn't any better either, with a poorly functional face unlock.</p>

<p>NUU incorporated extensive parental controls into the N10, making this phone ideal for tweens or teenagers. Since the phone doesn't cost much, the appeal is much higher for younger audiences who can't afford more expensive devices or aren't allowed to have premium phones.</p><p>Considering the price and build quality, the NUU N10 is an ideal starter phone for kids. If it breaks, it won't hurt their guardians much as the investment is so low to begin with. The parental controls add a layer of reassurance. And with no heavy-duty bloatware installed, the device runs well enough for children to use on the daily without getting stuck or hanging.</p><p>For the longest time, I couldn't imagine any brand other than Xiaomi when considering such a tight budget. And let's be honest, the only reason why Xiaomi is able to sell you a decked-out cheap phone is because it comes chock-full of clunky bloatware and ads. It's a marvel how little this phone costs despite having none of those things.</p><p>The long and the short of it is that this is an inexpensive Android phone with no creature comforts. It doesn't immediately look cheap, but it certainly feels like it to a certain extent. The lackluster audio gear exhibits cost-effective traits as well. Nevertheless, the NUU N10 is one of the few $100 Android phones that can be used without ripping all the hair off your head. If you're in a pinch, it'll do.</p>

Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x6-pro-review">X6 Pro</a> combined great hardware with an unbeatable value, and POCO is doing the same with the X7 Pro. The phone has a brighter AMOLED panel, better camera at the back, and a massive battery — the Indian model has a 6500mAh unit. <br><br>Interestingly, POCO partnered with Marvel to launch the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/this-is-the-poco-x7-pro-iron-man-edition">Iron Man edition</a> of the X7 Pro, and it looks incredible. It's exciting to see budget phones get limited-edition variants, and it adds a level of exclusivity to the X7 Pro that you don't usually see in this category. <br><br>POCO is doing all the right things with ingress protection, and the X7 Pro gets IP68 as standard. Like previous years, value is a big differentiator, and the X7 Pro manages to undercut its rivals once again. I used the device for just over two weeks, and I'm convinced this is one of the best budget phones around.</p>

<p>Xiaomi unveiled the POCO X7 and X7 Pro on January 9, and both phones are now available in select global regions. The standard X7 has a dual-curved design and is powered by the Dimensity 7300, but it has the same cameras as the X7 Pro. The main difference is a smaller 5110mAh battery (5500mAh in India), and it costs ₹21,999 ($253) for the 8GB/128GB variant. There's also an 8GB/256GB model that costs ₹23,999 ($276) in India and £199 ($247) in the U.K. Xiaomi is selling a 12GB/512GB edition of the POCO X7 in the U.K., and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xiaomi-X7-Pro-smartphone-HyperCharge/dp/B0DKP4M9DS">going for £249</a> ($310) as of writing. <br><br>The POCO X7 Pro, meanwhile, is powered by the Dimensity 8400 platform, and it has a 6000mAh battery. POCO has a dedicated variant in India with a massive 6550mAh battery, and the device starts at ₹27,999 ($322) for the 8GB/256GB variant in the country and £269 ($335) in the U.K. There's also a 12GB/256GB model that costs ₹29,999 ($346) in India, and the U.K. gets a 12GB/512GB model that's selling at £309 ($384). <br><br>I'm using the Iron Man edition of the X7 Pro, and it comes in a single 12GB/512GB configuration. This model is limited to select Southeast Asian countries, where it costs the equivalent of $399.</p>


<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-design"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Design</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.87%;"><img id="JY3oEHpUH2UrAvYs2jYutP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JY3oEHpUH2UrAvYs2jYutP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2692" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO overhauled the design of the X series this year, and the X7 and X7 Pro look quite different to their predecessors. Interestingly, the standard X7 retains the dual-curved design and ends up looking like the costlier option, with the X7 Pro switching to a boxy profile with flat sides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4pRiRZtz6hpAUgA5cP62Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4pRiRZtz6hpAUgA5cP62Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the X7 Pro has beveled sides, so it isn't uncomfortable to hold the device. And even though it has a sizeable 6000mAh battery, it comes in at an easily manageable 195g. That's because it features a polycarbonate mid-frame as well as a plastic back, but you don't quite get the feeling that you're using a budget phone — POCO did a good job with the basics.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="USbbCP9mhFPjU6TvSchP2Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USbbCP9mhFPjU6TvSchP2Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the sides have a matte texture, and the coating extends to the back as well. The Iron Man edition has a custom etched design at the back that highlights Iron Man's helmet, and it is pretty distinctive. The regular variants just get a matte texture at the back, and POCO has a yellow model with a leather back this time.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="htiw7ZTxVx8dUVi8ydkVsP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/htiw7ZTxVx8dUVi8ydkVsP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera island looks cleaner this year as POCO is using just two cameras at the back, and it doesn't dominate attention at the back. It doesn't jut out considerably from the body, and while there is a little wobble when using the phone, a case mitigates the issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="dwpcCrK29NTswS4ibD7VvP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dwpcCrK29NTswS4ibD7VvP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You get red accents around the camera lenses at the back and the power button, and it gives the design a little added flair. Other niceties include an IR blaster, and IP68 ingress protection. It's great to see POCO delivering the same standard of dust and water resistance as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14t-pro-review">Xiaomi 14T</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">14 Ultra</a> on budget phones, and the Indian model even gets IP69 — just like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PFvpVa5HzNf6M4ye7BjDrP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PFvpVa5HzNf6M4ye7BjDrP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are no problems with usability on the X7 Pro. Xiaomi did a great job with the design of the phone, and the matte texture combined with a relatively light chassis makes holding and using the phone that much more comfortable.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-display"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Display</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="24TPN5Lag95GHbVVCPvH5Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/24TPN5Lag95GHbVVCPvH5Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO is using the same 6.67-inch AMOLED panel as last year, but it has better brightness — it now goes up to 1400 nits in HBM mode and 3200 nits when viewing HDR content. There is a noticeable difference when viewing the panel next to the X6 Pro, and it gets brighter in outdoor use. The panel is covered by Gorilla Glass 7i, and like all POCO phones, you get a screen protection installed out of the box.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NMK5vyeGE8BBExsg5BMj6Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NMK5vyeGE8BBExsg5BMj6Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It isn't the brightest screen around — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-note-14-pro-plus-review">Redmi Note 14 Pro+</a> gets brighter — but I didn't see any issues using the device outdoors, and it has good color rendition and contrast levels. You get 120Hz refresh, but you'll have to go into the settings to enable the mode, and there's Dolby Vision integration. You get a decent amount of customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance, and a good selection of always-on styles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DJNeujrzmnCSgCk8oQzp3Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJNeujrzmnCSgCk8oQzp3Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The X7 Pro does a great job with HDR content in the likes of Netflix and YouTube, and it holds up well during gaming. I would have liked increased brightness in regular use, but as it stands, this is still one of the best AMOLED panels around in the budget category. You even get 1920Hz PWM dimming,</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-hardware-and-battery"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Hardware and battery</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GFF75kJu4VPK6Sh9mFCorP" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GFF75kJu4VPK6Sh9mFCorP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO knows how to deliver great hardware on a budget, and the X7 Pro continues that trend. The device is powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 8400 Ultra, and just like the Dimensity 9400, it only has big cores — you get a Cortex A725 running at 3.25GHz, three Cortex A725 cores at 3.0GHz, and four A725 cores going up to 2.1GHz. Also included is a Mali-G720 GPU with seven cores, and it manages to do a terrific job. <br><br>Basically, the X7 Pro is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best budget phone</a> around in this regard, and if you need a gaming-focused device that doesn't cost a lot of cash, this is the one to get. The phone blazes through mundane tasks, and it manages to hold its own in demanding titles as well; while you don't quite get the same stable framerates as high-end devices, it does a better job than most other budget phones available today.</p>

<p>I didn't notice any lag or stutter either, and the device has been a delight to use. There are no issues with connectivity either, and while the vibration motor doesn't have granular feedback, it is decent enough. You get AptX HD codecs and NFC as well, and that is a nice bonus. <br><br>Coming to the battery side of things, I got well over a day's worth of use with the X7 Pro. I'm using the model with the 6000mAh battery, and users in India should get even better battery life thanks to the oversized 6500mAh unit in the region. The battery doesn't last as long as other phones with 6000mAh cells like the X200 Pro, but I still got a day's worth of use consistently, and there was never any battery anxiety. <br><br>Charging the battery takes 46 minutes using the bundled 90W charger, and annoyingly, POCO doesn't include the charger in all countries. My device came with the charger included in the package, but that isn't the case in the U.K. and other western markets.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-poco-x7-pro-cameras"><span>POCO X7 Pro: Cameras</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MEaTgeks5HP7pPiHx64bDQ" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MEaTgeks5HP7pPiHx64bDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>POCO's phones don't have the best cameras, and the X7 Pro is aiming to do better on that front. The device gets a 50MP main camera with Sony's IMX882 imaging module, and it's joined by an 8MP wide-angle lens. There's no 2MP lens at the back, and that's a good thing — it was one of the most pointless sensors ever fitted to a phone. <br><br>The camera interface is identical to last year, so you get the same shooting modes, same effects and filters, and the same toggles around the viewfinder. You finally get the ability to shoot 4K60 video via the rear camera, and it's a much-needed inclusion. It is limited to the main lens — the wide-angle only goes up to 1080p — but it's a good addition nonetheless.</p>

<p>The phone takes decent shots in daylight conditions, producing photos with good dynamic range and colors. It does a good job in low-light scenarios as well, and while you don't get quite as much detail, there isn't much in the way of noise. The wide-angle lens is average, and while it takes passable photos in good lighting situations, it doesn't manage to deliver the same caliber of shots at night. <br><br>The camera is better than previous years, but it still isn't the best in this category. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">Nord 4</a> takes better photos in just about any situation, so if you need a good set of cameras at the back, you should pick up that device instead. If you're okay with average cameras and need a phone with powerful hardware, the X7 Pro gets my recommendation.</p>

<p>Software continues to be an area where POCO's devices have a definite edge over their Redmi siblings; the X7 Pro runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and it comes with the usual slate of AI-assisted features. The software interface will be familiar if you've used a Xiaomi or POCO phone in recent years, and while there aren't any visual changes, you get better fluidity. <br><br>I still believe that Xiaomi is in need of a visual overhaul, and it needs to do something about the bloatware on its devices. Other than that, I don't have any negatives on the software front; the Iron Man edition has a few custom extras — including icons and backgrounds — but it has the same feature-set as the standard X7 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2DSPyjtuoC8oCH6vxQsq7Q" name="POCO X7 Pro" alt="POCO X7 Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2DSPyjtuoC8oCH6vxQsq7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xiaomi tends to be overly aggressive with memory management, and there were instances where I had issues receiving push notifications. This is an issue on most Xiaomi phones I use, and I get around it by disabling any battery-related tweaks. <br><br>The X7 Pro will get three guaranteed Android updates alongside four years of security updates, and that is decent enough in this category. That said, Xiaomi doesn't do a good job delivering updates on time, so when updates will actually make their way to the device is an unknown — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is unlikely to be rolled out anytime before the end of the year.</p>

<p>I really like the OnePlus Nord 4, and the device continues to be a good choice in 2025. It has similar caliber of hardware, and holds up incredibly well during gaming. The design is cleaner, but you get a smaller 5500mAh battery. Coming in at ₹28,999 ($335), it is costlier than the X7 Pro, but it is a solid alternative. <br><br><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-f6-review">POCO's F6</a> is also a good recommendation if you need a gaming-focused device. It outmatches the X7 Pro in this regard, and as it has been around for the better part of a year, it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.flipkart.com/poco-f6-5g-titanium-256-gb/p/itme731d9a334947?pid=MOBHYUZGDMF7UJMG">down to just ₹26,999</a> ($312), making it a terrific bargain. It has better cameras than the X7 Pro as well, but it has a relatively smaller 5000mAh battery.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone that feels great to hold and use</li><li>You want a battery that easily lasts a day</li><li>You need good performance</li><li>You want reliable ingress protection</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a budget phone with great cameras</li></ul>
<p>POCO didn't change the fundamentals too much with the X7 Pro, and that's a good thing. The phone continues to be one of the fastest in the budget category, and you get a vibrant AMOLED panel, standout battery life, and fast charging. The cameras aren't the best around, but the main camera does a decent job in its own right. <br><br>There's a lot to like with the software, and the fact that you get Android 15 out of the box gives the X7 Pro a distinct advantage over the Redmi Note 14 Pro+. The only negative is that the model sold in the U.K. and other western markets isn't as good as the Indian variant, but outside of that, the X7 Pro is a terrific budget phone. As an overall package, there are few devices that manage to come close.</p>

<p>Motorola makes some of the most value-for-money Android phones and is always pushing the expectations envelope across price segments. Sure, it has a few misses now and then, but by and large, we have generally gotten good products. Its Moto G series has been globally acclaimed for delivering exceptional value in the budget segment, and that continues with the latest Moto G Power 2025.</p><p>Priced the same as the Moto G Power 5G 2024, the new model offers an updated design, better shatter protection for the display, and a truly impressive IP69 rating for ultimate dust and water resistance. This makes it a no-brainer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-300">under $300</a>, but the 2024 model is now heavily discounted, which makes it good value too. If you're unable to decide between Moto G Power 202 vs. Moto G Power 5G 2024, we're here to help.</p>

<p>Motorola has dropped the 5G moniker from the name, so it's just the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-moto-g-power-2025-and-moto-g-2025-launch">Moto G Power 2025</a>. It has a similar vegan leather material for the back panel as the previous model, so it should be comfortable to hold, and fingerprints should be a non-issue. It has gotten a bit fatter at 8.7mm and a tad heavier at 208g when compared to the 2024 model. The new rear camera housing with four exposed rings makes it look more premium, as the design is similar to the Moto Edge series.</p><p>The two big changes to the design are the addition of Gorilla Glass 5 for the display and the new durability certifications. The display is still an IPS LCD panel but a bit larger at 6.8 inches. You still get the 120Hz refresh rate. We hope Motorola has increased the maximum brightness in the Moto G Power 2025 as the previous model wasn't the easiest to use outdoors, under sunlight.</p><p>The big talking point, however, is the IP68/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating on the 2025 Moto G Power. Till now, we've only seen this on a few flagships like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review" target="_blank">OnePlus 13</a>, so to have it on a $300 phone is mighty impressive. Motorola has also boosted its durability by padding it with a MIL-STD-810H certification for toughness. The phone is available in Slate Gray and Leaf Green. The latter shade gives the phone a unique look and is something I'd pick if I were using it without a case.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-5g-2024-review">Moto G Power 5G 2024</a> is a tiny bit slimmer and lighter and should offer a similar in-hand feel thanks to the vegan leather back. The frame is plastic but it doesn't really feel cheap or poorly put together. One thing we noted in our review is that the rear leather panel is prone to scuffing quite easily, which can make your week-old phone look a few months old if you're not careful.</p><p>The display has prominent bezels and a big chin, which screams budget. The 6.7-inch display has a 120Hz refresh rate and a Full HD+ resolution. We found it to be plenty sharp with good color reproduction for both games and regualar app usage. The brightness was the only main sore point here, as it was rather difficult to see outdoors when we reviewed it.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 is only available as a single variant with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage for $299.99. Even though it's sold unlocked, it is compatible with all the major U.S. carriers. Eventually, you should be able to buy it via a carrier, too, at a heavily subsidized price. You don't get a charger in the box (some carriers might bundle one), so you'll have to buy one separately or choose from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-phone-charger">best USB-C chargers</a>.</p><p>The processor in the Moto G Power 2025 is the MediaTek Dimensity 6300, which feels like a downgrade to the Dimensity 7020, on paper anyway. Both are built on the 6nm process, but the 6300 has a higher maximum CPU clock speed of 2.4GHz, and it uses a different GPU. At the same time, the 7020 has a higher memory bandwidth. We'll know how much of an impact the new chip actually makes once we review the phone, but overall, I wouldn't expect much of a difference in daily usage.</p><p>The rest of the specs of the Moto G Power 2025 are similar to last year's model. There's expandable storage, NFC, stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, a side-mounted fingerprint sensor, and a 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired and 15W wireless charging. The camera setup also seems identical. You get a 50MP main sensor with an f/1.8 aperture and an 8MP ultrawide with autofocus, so it can be used as a macro camera. Selfie duties are handled by a 16MP sensor. The image quality of the 2024 Moto G Power was just about average, so I'm keen to know if Motorola has made any improvements here.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 also launched at the same $299.99 price in 2024 for 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM. Motorola is now selling it at a heavily reduced price of $179.99, which makes it much better value compared to its original price.</p><p>It's powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7020, which <em>looks</em> a bit better on paper, and it delivers decent performance for casual games. Do anything more intensive, though, like try running any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games" target="_blank">premium Android game</a>, and the phone will start to choke. We found the battery life to be solid, lasting a full day even with heavy use. Lighter users should be able to go two to three days before thinking about charging it.</p><p>Connectivity features of the Moto G Power 5G 2024 are similar to the newer model, including the presence of NFC. The cameras are also the same, with a 50MP and 8MP rear sensors and a 16MP sensor in the front. The performance of the two rear cameras is strictly okay and good enough for casual use only.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a>, which also runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> with Motorola's unobtrusive customizations. The software experience should be very similar which means you can expect the usual Moto Actions gestures like the double-chop to turn on the flashlight, double-twist of your wrist to open the camera, and so on. The Moto G is slated to get two OS updates and three years of security patches, which should also apply to the G Power.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 ran <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and Motorola has released the Android 15 update <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en-us.support.motorola.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/184137/~/whats-new-in-android-15%3F---moto-g-power-5g---2024">changelog</a> for the phone too. However, it's hard to say if it will get anything beyond this. Motorola doesn't have the best track record when it comes to timely OS updates, even for its premium phones, so we'll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>If you already have a $300 budget, just get the Moto G Power 2025. It has the best water and dust-proof certification, bar none, in that segment. There's wireless charging, and you get a great-looking phone. It also comes with the latest Android version, two promised OS updates, and it's certified to survive falls and drops.</p><p>The only other alternative worth looking at is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">CMF Phone 1</a> by Nothing. For a lower price, you get an AMOLED screen, a customizable back panel, good cameras, and three years of promised updates. Be aware, though, that 5G coverage is a bit spotty in the U.S., and there's no wireless charging, IP rating, or NFC.</p><p>The Moto G Power 5G 2024 wasn't easy to recommend at $300, but at its current $180 price, it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones-under-200">best picks under $200</a>. I would argue that it's slightly better value than the new Moto G 2025 since it has an ultrawide camera and wireless charging.</p>

<hr>
<p>Ever since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-teaser">Galaxy S25 Edge was teased</a> at the recent Unpacked event, we've been waiting to learn more about the elusive device. The most recent leak comes from tipster Anthony/<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_">@TheGalox_</a>, who took to X to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/TheGalox_/status/1888235427917672575?s=19">reveal</a> a spec list of the upcoming device that will likely appear in April this year.</p><p>According to Anthony, the phone will sport a 6.7-inch QHD+ dynamic AMOLED display with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The device will allegedly be 5.84mm thin, as indicated to us in a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/leak-reveals-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edges-thickness-and-battery-size" target="_blank"> previous leak</a>. The tipster goes on to say that the device will feature a fairly meager 3,900mAh battery and a vapor chamber cooling system within, which may be similar to the one featured with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>.</p><p>The rear panel of the device will apparently feature two powerful cameras: the 200MP primary sensor (which has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-slim-could-pack-a-serious-camera-punch-despite-its-thin-profile">previously rumored</a>) and a 50MP ultrawide lens, although there's no mention of the selfie/front-facing camera.</p><p>The phone is said to come with 12GB of RAM and two storage, either 256GB or 512GB. There's no mention of software, another post by avid tipster Yogesh Brar suggests that the phone will come packed with the new One UI 7 out of the box. As such, the phone will have all the AI quirks that will be featured in the Galaxy S25 series.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge- 6.6" dAMOLED, 120Hz display- Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC- 200MP + 50MP (UW)- IP68- OneUI 7- 3,900mAh battery- 25W charging<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1888844172905296347">February 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>However, both leaks have slightly conflicting details about the device's dimensions. This one mentions that it will have a slightly smaller 6.6" display. Brar also adds that the Galaxy S25 Edge will come with an IP68 dust and water resistance certification, similar to the Galaxy S25 series. While the battery specs seem to be the same on both leaks, Brar adds that the device will support 25W charging, with no mention of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-support-qi2-wireless-charging">compatibility with Qi2</a>.</p><p>While we don't have much information on how many colorways this phone will launch with, Anthony says that it will cost around $1100, meaning it will sit somewhere between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>While these leaks paint a slightly clearer picture of what we could expect from this phone, there are still some grey areas that have been left to people's imagination, particularly given potential compromises in the name of thinness.

Similarly, managing editor Derrek Lee feels as though the move is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-reveal-feels-desperate">desperate attempt by Samsung</a> to appear interesting again. Regardless, we anticipate to know more about the phone closer to the device's official release.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube, which is celebrating 20 years, is sharing its four "big bets" for 2025.</li><li>AI is at the center of YouTube's goals, which include using machine learning to estimate a user's age.</li><li>YouTube says TVs are now the primary device used to watch YouTube videos, eclipsing mobile.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube">YouTube</a> turns 20 this year, and while the platform is two-decades old, many of its users are much younger. To celebrate the anniversary, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan outlined the platform's "big bets" for 2025 in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/our-big-bets-for-2025/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, and they involve clamping down on younger users lying about their age.</p><p>"We’re also laser focused on protecting our youngest users," the company says. "And that's why we'll use machine learning in 2025 to help us estimate a user’s age — distinguishing between younger viewers and adults — to help provide the best and most age appropriate experiences and protections."</p><p>It's unclear exactly how YouTube plans to algorithmically estimate the age of its users, but it comes as age verification and requirements for social media platforms becomes a hot topic in the U.S. and abroad. YouTube already offers certain protections for younger users, and parental controls for parents. The platform's official age requirement for individual accounts is 13 years, but younger kids can use the YouTube Kids app with help from a parent.</p><p>Separately, YouTube wants to make the platform better for education by building new ways to learn about topics shown in a video and creating a mechanism for YouTubers to build courses.</p><p>Age verification and protections are just the start of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">how YouTube plans to use AI and machine learning to grow</a> and safeguard the platform in 2025. It's also working on protections against deepfakes on the platform, so creators can control how AI portrays them on YouTube. It's starting out with a pilot program for prominent people, but theoretically could grow beyond that in the future.</p><p>It could become expanded, like YouTube plans to expand auto-dubbing after a small test last year. YouTube says it will soon make auto-dubbing, which automatically translates content to other languages with one press, available to everyone in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>Of course, YouTube is very confident in its place in social media and pop culture as 2025 begins. It says YouTube "will remain the epicenter of culture," and is doubling-down on TV. To that end, YouTube says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv-fantasy-custom-multiview-nfl-sunday-ticket">TV is now the primary device type for watching YouTube</a>, even ahead of mobile.</p><p>"It's remarkable to think that YouTube has been helping people create, learn, connect and more for two decades," Mohan writes. "As we embark on our next chapter, we're committed to empowering creators, fostering community, and continuing to redefine how the world watches, listens, and connects."</p>

<ul><li>Google Maps is rolling out its name change for the Gulf of Mexico, and users will see one of three different names based on their region.</li><li>Users in the U.S. will see the Gulf of America name, users in Mexico will see the Gulf of Mexico name, and users in other regions will see both names.</li><li>The region is set by your device's operating system and SIM provider, so it's hard to change manually.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The Gulf of Mexico is now the Gulf of America on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a>, at least in the U.S. The body of water bordering the southeastern North American coast will now appear differently on Google Maps depending on a user's location, following a change that is rolling out now.</p><p>As <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-to-adopt-gulf-of-america-rename">Google announced weeks ago</a>, the company said it has "a longstanding practice of applying name changes when they have been updated in official government sources," and thus planned to rename the Gulf of Mexico when the U.S. officially completed its name change. That process has been completed, as the Gulf of America is the new name for this body of water in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730" target="_blank">U.S. Geographic Names Information System</a>.</p><p>The move is only indirectly related to President Donald Trump's executive order issuing the name change. This is why the renaming is taking effect on Google Maps now, not when the executive order was first issued. Instead, the reason for the name change in the U.S. is because the U.S. Department of the Interior officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://edits.nationalmap.gov/apps/gaz-domestic/public/search/names/558730" target="_blank">updated the Gulf of Mexico's name in the GNIS by Order 3423</a> issued by Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.</p><p>Of course, the controversial renaming of the Gulf of Mexico was directed by President Trump. The resulting effect on Google Maps is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>United States users will see the name "Gulf of America"</li><li>Mexico users will see the name "Gulf of Mexico"</li><li>Users in all other regions will see both names</li></ul>
<p>"The names you see in the Maps app are based on your country location, which is determined by information from your phone’s operating system (e.g., iOS and Android), including your SIM, network, and locale," Google explains. "If you’re using Google Maps on the web, the names are based on the region you select in your Search settings or your device’s location, if you haven’t selected one."</p><p>Based on these conditions, it is virtually impossible to change the Google Maps name of the Gulf of Mexico/Gulf of America to your preference manually.</p>

<p>Apple Maps plans to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America, too. Other popular navigation providers, like Bing Maps and MapQuest, haven't made a public decision yet.</p>

<p>Much of this frustration started for me when the Android team redesigned the multitasking UI during the Android 9 Pie update. Instead of the vertically-scrolling card interface that showed four or five apps at a time, Google's design team opted to follow the old Palm Pre model of large, horizontally scrolling cards — something that isn't very surprising given the head designer of Android was also on the Palm WebOS team.</p><p>This new design made multitasking very inefficient because only one large app card is visible on the screen at a time, while a sliver of one additional app is shown off to the side. There's no way to tell what app is next in the list until it appears, making it hard to switch quickly between more than two apps at a time. Thankfully, companies like OnePlus, Vivo, Samsung, and a few others have figured out that this UI isn't the best.</p><p>From grids of apps to floating windows, triple-app split screens, and quick app switching, I've picked out my favorite Android multitasking UIs that'll let you get more done in less time. The most efficient way to multitask on a modern Android phone is to use swipe gestures, not the traditional 3-button navigation layout, so many of the gesture-based features I speak about below are dependent on that setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-best-oneplus-2">The best: OnePlus</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wf5WaHFDdp8SXNp8XghBzY" name="oneplus-13-multitasking-ui" alt="Multitasking on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wf5WaHFDdp8SXNp8XghBzY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>OnePlus and Oppo phones let you quickly switch between 10 apps at once with a single swipe and a tap.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>OnePlus has the best default multitasking UI you'll find on any Android phone, but it wasn't always that way. Back when Android 9 Pie came out, OnePlus quickly adopted Google's terrible UI but realized its mistake when its most loyal users were unhappy with the oversimplified UI. Since then, OnePlus' multitasking UI design has managed to bridge the best of every idea, offering a quick way to instantly swap between seven apps at once, run two apps at once, and even quickly hover a third app on the screen.</p><p>From the overview UI, it's possible to choose from the last <strong>10 apps</strong> with a single swipe and a tap. This is thanks to the quick slider at the bottom that shows the icons of each app along with a large card of the app above it. This is the fastest you can switch between apps on any Android UI and it's also available on OPPO phones thanks to the company's merging of Color OS and Oxygen OS code bases.</p><p>Ironically, this UI is very similar to what Apple used to have in iOS 7-9 before the iPhone X came out. I say ironically because the company made multitasking worse by removing the bottom row of icons, but thankfully, OnePlus and OPPO realized their mistake and capitalized on it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i" name="oneplus-13-multitasking" alt="Quickly juggling multiple apps on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WJoYZ6JhzTLKVY3Mzuh27i.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You can also quickly split the screen or make the current app float by dragging your thumb up from the bottom of the screen until the current app card rests in the "floating" or "split" sections that appear on the screen. Some other phones, like Samsung, have a version of this feature but don't allow you to do it in a single swipe.</p><p>The introduction of the Canvas feature from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> was rolled into the Oxygen OS 15/Color OS 15 update for any eligible phone and allows you to run split-screen apps in a "nearly full-screen" mode. This makes it more convenient to use split-screen mode because you can have the prominent app take up 90% of the display while the other rests at the bottom 10%, waiting to be maximized.</p>
<h2 id="runner-up-vivo-2">Runner-up: Vivo</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="t7R7DzvqhBn7Wu4tRGiDLN" name="Vivo-X100-Pro-multitasking-ui-grid" alt="Multitasking on the Vivo X100 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t7R7DzvqhBn7Wu4tRGiDLN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Vivo offers a selection of a grid or AOSP-style card list right on the Overview screen.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Out of the box, Vivo users can quickly select between the traditional single-large-card UI and a tablet-like grid of cards with the tap of a button. On the Overview UI, just tap the icon at the bottom to switch between the two views, making it easy to select from <strong>4 apps</strong> via a single tap and <strong>another four</strong> with a swipe.</p><p>You can find this grid of cards on other phones, but most require you to do something special to enable it. Foldable phones usually only have this UI on the large inner display, and while Samsung phones offer several similar UI options, you have to separately download the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> app from the Galaxy Apps store along with a separate module just to find the option. Vivo makes it available via a single tap on all its phones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SMtf8iaqXSdk5jpkJVbuWB" name="vivo-x100-pro-multitasking" alt="Efficiently multitasking on the Vivo X100 Pro with the grid view option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SMtf8iaqXSdk5jpkJVbuWB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo's UI also features the same swipe-up-and-hold to either split or float the active window that's on OnePlus and OPPO phones. In fact, most phones from China sport this feature, making us wonder why Samsung, Google, Motorola, and others don't implement it.</p>
<h2 id="power-user-option-samsung-2">Power user option: Samsung</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BRWCoDPMyqaeYfBUEfTCeF" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-Ultra-One-UI-7-Beta-2-multitasking" alt="The new multitasking UI in One UI 7 Beta 2 running on a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BRWCoDPMyqaeYfBUEfTCeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung's default stacked cards in One UI 7 offers kinetic scrolling, improving the stock experience, but the real key lies in using one of the many Good Lock alternatives.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Samsung <em>finally</em> got with the program and did something about the terrible stock multitasking UI in Android when it began rolling out the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7 beta</a> at the end of 2024. The new UI looks like a mash-up of Android and iOS designs, sporting the stacked card look of iOS with the four quick icons at the bottom.</p><p>The problem with Samsung's design is that the icons at the bottom aren't based on active apps. They're based on an algorithm Google built into Android that tries to figure out which apps you use most often. That means these icons are almost never the same, and while they can sometimes be helpful, the lack of consistency is more a problem than a help.</p><p>At the least, Samsung's cards "snap" into place, making it easier to focus on each one as it passes by. But you don't have to deal with this nonsense UI if you <em>really</em> want to multitask. Just download Good Lock and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">change basically anything</a> you see on the Overview screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DEccU7R7u5Sb5Gq8xjQbVH" name="samsung-multitasking" alt="Multitasking in One UI with the stacked list and grid options" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DEccU7R7u5Sb5Gq8xjQbVH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With Good Lock, you can select from five different "task changer" UI designs. List is the default option that shows one vertical card at a time. Grid is the one I praised Vivo for including by default, and it shows six app cards on screen at a time. Stack is the new default in One UI 7 and shows one prominent card up front with three cards "peaking" behind it. This one makes it easier to see what app is next in the list but doesn't enhance multitasking as much as the Grid option does.</p><p>The Vertical List option resembles the original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/rJyVNrxGonU?si=dtU5tvwC66KfVGUK&t=34">Galaxy Nexus multitasking UI</a> of vertically-scrolling cards, which makes better use of screen space than the default horizontal list. The last option, Slim List, is the "real" power user option as it offers <strong>seven apps</strong> to choose from immediately.</p><p>Samsung also offers hover and split-screen app options, but you need to open up the Overview UI first, then long-press on a card and drag it to the appropriate action. This is an extra step versus what Vivo, OnePlus, OPPO, and other Chinese brands offer.</p>
<h2 id="honorable-mention-foldables-2">Honorable mention: Foldables</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4232px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="foMdWDkAdjygAHYBSNvT7H" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-04.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold open apps view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/foMdWDkAdjygAHYBSNvT7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4232" height="2381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Book style foldables offer multiple ways to multitask, and most have a pinnable dock that allows for one-tap multitasking.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Technically, book-style foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> and the OnePlus Open offer the best multitasking experience on any phone, but not everyone likes the size of these devices. Most offer a different multitasking experience on the smaller outer display than what's on the big inner display.</p><p>Some foldables, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> below, don't have an option to "pin" the dock at the bottom of the screen. Most other book-style foldables, however, allow you to have this dock present at all times, meaning multitasking is a single tap away at all times.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KEsirm7eEguyEZ82ZcLWrY" name="honor-magic-v3-foldable-multitasking" alt="Multitasking on an Honor Magic V3 using the app dock and grid view Overview UI" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KEsirm7eEguyEZ82ZcLWrY.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OnePlus wins the award for best foldable multitasking UI because its small screen UI is identical to its other phones, including that handy row of app icons at the bottom. When you open the phone, you'll find there's no real reason to ever open Overview, thanks to the app dock at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>While most foldables have this dock now thanks to Samsung and Android 12L, OnePlus one-ups things with its Canvas software that lets you run <strong>three apps</strong> <strong>at a time</strong> on the big screen. You can arrange these in several ways, but it takes multitasking to a new level.</p>
<h2 id="barely-better-than-stock-google-motorola-nothing-honor-2">Barely better than stock: Google, Motorola, Nothing, Honor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GAhzLRJBgQ5DwCmKFVfbMj" name="google-pixel-9-multitasking-ui-buttons" alt="The quick image copy button, screeshot button, and select button on the multitasking UI on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAhzLRJBgQ5DwCmKFVfbMj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many Android manufacturers have chosen to stick mostly to the stock UI but add a few convenience features. Motorola and Google offer quick action buttons at the bottom for taking a screenshot, allowing you to screenshot an app in the Overview UI without having to reopen it. I'm not sure who uses this, but I've never found myself tapping the button other than to see what it does.</p><p>Motorola also offers a button below the cards that locks the app in memory, making it a priority to stay in RAM for quick access in case the phone is running low. This is best for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-2025-review">Moto G 2025</a> that only have 4GB of RAM and might reload apps often. A third button is available from the Overview UI on some Motorola phones when the sidebar gesture option is enabled, allowing apps to be quickly floated with a tap and then moved into a semi-hidden side panel when minimized.</p><p>Google Pixel phones have a screenshot button and a second "Select" button that can extract text from an app tile, but it's far slower and clunkier than just swiping between two apps using the gesture bar at the bottom of the screen. Some cards on the Pixel Overview UI also have a quick "copy link" or "copy image" button, which is actually quite handy on some occasions. Overall, though, the Pixel's Overview UI is overengineered and poorly designed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YeENuJUtk7zdqBrde2Kcq9" name="pixel-multitasking" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with its clunky, slow interface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YeENuJUtk7zdqBrde2Kcq9.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>These companies add something to the barebones AOSP experience but don't fix the core problem of the large card design.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Honor keeps the default giant card UI but enhances things by adding a small button to the top right of each card to instantly float the window. This doesn't help with switching between more than two apps quickly, but it's at least a little better for juggling three apps when you have one floating. Honor also has a quick hover and split-screen action when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen and drag the card to the appropriate action.</p><p>Nothing doesn't add any buttons to the Overview UI but does allow users to quickly float the active app by sliding up from the bottom of the screen until the card gets to the top half of the screen. This will put the app in a floating window for nicer multitasking, complete with clearly marked "minimize" and "close" buttons in the app's floating frame (similar to Motorola), but overall, it's the most basic of all four companies listed here.</p><p>While these four companies do something better than AOSP, they're niche features that you probably won't use all the time. They don't fix the main problem, which is the inefficient single giant card on the screen and no real way to quickly switch to another app without needless scrolling. Additionally, none of them offer the kinetic scrolling Samsung offers, making it more difficult to find the app you want as the card goes whizzing by.</p>
<h2 id="aosp-needs-a-facelift-2">AOSP needs a facelift</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA" name="android-multitasking-ui-oneplus-pixel-nothing-honor-motorola-vivo-02" alt="Showing the different multitasking UIs on six different Android phones" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ku3L7QQJCa5qsiZsGiDrdA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I find it very hard to understand why Google hasn't fixed this UI in the seven years since Android 9 Pie was released. I got excited when the first Pixel Fold was unveiled in May 2023 and showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-fold-multitasking-ui">a grid-like multitasking UI</a>, only to later find out that this UI only appeared on the large inner display, not the outer display that I used most of the time.</p><p>The bottom line is that Android's default Overview multitasking UI needs a huge facelift. The best alternative right now is OnePlus's default design, which takes the large card format and substantially enhances it with a simple icon grid below, making it easy to switch between the last 10 apps with a single swipe and a tap.</p><p>Every other company convolutes this process in some way, with the next-best option falling under the grid format on Vivo and Samsung phones or the vertically-scrolling "slim list" on Samsung's Good Lock app. Any company that opts for stock Android is simply stuck with the worst option possible, making multitasking a chore rather than a joy.</p><p>Google needs to address this with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and it needs to happen ASAP. You have lots of options to choose from, Google. Any of them would be an improvement over what's currently available. Thanks.</p>
