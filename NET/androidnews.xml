I'd love to get her the standard Meta Quest 3, but given that the Meta Quest 3S is <em>half the price</em> of a Quest 3 during Prime Day, our budget will be happier with this choice.</p><p>This deal not only slashes $50 off the price, but it also includes either $45 worth of Gorilla Tag coins or a free copy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, depending on your preference.

First and foremost, it's built by Google with in-house chips and seven years of software support.</p><p>Google's custom Tensor processors are designed with Gemini in mind, featuring tons of amazing features like Magic Cue, Camera Coach, Pixel Journal, a new docking mode, and industry-leading spam filtering and call screening.</p><p>The Pixel 10 series is also the only major Android phone to debut with MagSafe magnets built inside. Google calls the system <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> and it not only allows you to use <em>all</em> MagSafe accessories without a special case, but also to use the new Qi2 wireless charging speeds.

If a smaller phone is more important to you, get the Pixel 10 Pro. It's got the same processor, RAM, storage, cameras, and features as the XL model, all in an impressively small package.</p><p>If a larger screen or longer battery life are your main concern, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is the best pick. That larger display looks simply lovely and gives you plenty of room for gaming or video watching, and the extra-large battery ensures you don't run out of battery even when using it fully for the whole day.</p><p>We've also found that Google's phone transfer process is a seamless experience <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-switched-from-iphone-to-pixel-after-12-years">if you're upgrading from any iPhone model</a>.

Other considerations like fold-flat design and long-lasting battery are good to have, but they're not dealbreakers. I used Bose's QuietComfort Ultra and Nothing's headsets for most of the year, and I switched to Baseus' Inspire XH1 last month.</p><p>What's so interesting about the Inspire XH1 is that it features sound tuned by Bose. This makes a huge difference, and the sound quality is easily among the best of any sub-$300 headset I used. It is lighter than most headsets, blocks ambient noise incredibly well, and lasts over 40 hours between charges. The best part? It <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XH1-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0FLQ3NFGM/">costs just $109 as part of Prime Day</a>; I'm not kidding when I say that this is the best audio deal you'll find.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c0bf85f0-e692-485c-a25c-40394683577d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The Inspire XH1 has fantastic sound, a lightweight fit, battery that lasts 40 hours, fold-flat design that's easy to take anywhere, and excellent ANC.

The value is just the icing on the cake.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if: </strong>You don't need a headset right now (I can't think of any negatives at this price).</p><p>The Inspire XH1 is lighter than the XM5, and the design is very similar to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra ‚Äî which isn't a coincidence. You get a swiveling headband that's comfortable, and the padded leather ear cushions are highly comfortable. I used these for hours on end and didn't feel any fatigue at all.</p><p>The foldable design along with the bundled hard shell case allows you to take the headset anywhere, and you get physical controls to adjust volume, toggle various modes, and music playback. On that note, there's spatial audio, and it makes a difference. The sound quality out of the box is among the best of any Bluetooth headset, much less budget models. That's down to the Bose tuning, with the XH1 holding its own against rivals that cost twice or even thrice as much.</p><p>There is a bit of a bass exuberance, and the treble is harsh at times, but you can tailor the sound to your preferences without too much of a hassle. The headset also does an excellent job tuning out ambient sounds to the tune of 48dB, and it was highly effective on flights. Talking about travel, the 50-hour battery life is more than adequate even for transcontinental journeys, and that's one of the reasons why I switched to the XH1.</p><p>It's available in four color options, and it connects to two devices at once. You get the LDAC codec in addition to the standard SBC and AAC codecs, and the angled drivers have sound quality that lends itself well to any genre.</p><p>All of this is my way of saying that this headset is an outlier, and while it doesn't have the prominence of Sony and Bose's products, it has the sound quality to match. Best of all, it is an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XH1-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0FLQ3NFGM/">unbeatable value at $109</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google has officially launched its AI-powered Try On feature in Canada, giving shoppers a virtual fitting room right on their screens.</p><p>The tool, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/shopping-with-google-virtual-ai-try-on-search-price-alerts-updates">first introduced in the U.S.</a>, uses Google‚Äôs custom image generation model designed specifically for fashion. It‚Äôs smart enough to understand how clothing behaves in the real world, like how fabric folds, stretches, or drapes on different body types.</p><p>Instead of just looking at a shirt or dress on a model who looks nothing like you, you can now upload your own full-body photo and see how it would actually look on you.</p><h2 id="try-it-on-from-anywhere-2">Try it on from anywhere</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FvGe9XPD79pBmt7pHpVey4" name="Try_On_Hero Video" alt="Google Try On AI tool for online shopping" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvGe9XPD79pBmt7pHpVey4.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To try it, you just need to tap the ‚ÄúTry it on‚Äù icon when browsing apparel items across Google Search, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-shopping-highlights-upgraded-ai-clothing-makeup">Google Shopping</a>, or Google Images. Upload your photo, and within seconds, Google shows you a realistic preview of how that exact outfit fits your body. You can switch up colors, experiment with styles, or go on a full-blown fashion trial spree without leaving your couch.</p><p>If you‚Äôre happy with a look, you can save it, share it with friends for a second opinion, or go straight to checkout through the merchant‚Äôs site. The idea is to make the digital shopping experience feel a lot more like being in a store, but with the convenience of doing it from home.</p><p>According to Google, the feature is powered by its Shopping Graph, which indexes billions of apparel items online. That means the Try On experience works seamlessly across countless brands and retailers, not just a curated few.</p><p>This launch is part of Google‚Äôs bigger push to make shopping more personal and interactive through AI. It joins other recent updates like price alerts, all aimed at helping users feel more confident when shopping online.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's a fantastic charger that I still use today, so when I checked to see if it was on sale for this year's Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, I was surprised to see that a better version had been released, and there's already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DGKWTQQC/">a great deal</a> you'll want to take advantage of before the sales event ends.</p><p>Originally priced at $59, the <strong>Anker Nano Portable Charger </strong>(or <strong>Anker Nano Power Bank</strong>) is already a steal for what you get.

I carry one most places I go, and a charger like the Anker Nano Power Bank should be perfect for more users on the go.</p><p>What's great about this particular charger is that it boasts a whopping 10,000mAh capacity, meaning it should be able to charge most phones twice, or provide a full charge and still have juice for extra power later on if needed. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> features a 5,000mAh battery, while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a> boasts a 6,000mAh capacity.</p><p>This particular charger is great because it supports 45W charging. Most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phones</a> charge at just 25W while the premium models top out at 45W, so this should be perfect for most. Even phones with faster charging should be able to get decent charging speeds.</p><p>With a built-in retractable USB-C cable, a separate USB-C port, and a USB-A port, you can charge multiple devices simultaneously while keeping track of your capacity or charging time with the small display. And to top it off, the Anker Nano Power Bank features a loop, making it easy to carry.</p><p>On the other hand, you can always opt for a more affordable option, such as the older and very similar Anker Nano Power Bank that I've been using for the past couple of years. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3">This model is also on sale</a> for Amazon Prime Big Deal Days, although it goes by the same name.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="a8b2abe3-64d7-48ad-ae3a-891311e4b862" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This Anker power bank may be a couple of years old, but the large battery and relatively fast charging make it a worthwhile accessory, especially at this discounted price." data-dimension48="This Anker power bank may be a couple of years old, but the large battery and relatively fast charging make it a worthwhile accessory, especially at this discounted price." data-dimension25="$29.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="qtLR9tUCaNjwvydAJJSATR" name="Anker-Nano-Power-bank" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qtLR9tUCaNjwvydAJJSATR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="1200" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>This Anker power bank may be a couple of years old, but the large battery and relatively fast charging make it a worthwhile accessory, especially at this discounted price.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9CJKCH3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="a8b2abe3-64d7-48ad-ae3a-891311e4b862" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This Anker power bank may be a couple of years old, but the large battery and relatively fast charging make it a worthwhile accessory, especially at this discounted price." data-dimension48="This Anker power bank may be a couple of years old, but the large battery and relatively fast charging make it a worthwhile accessory, especially at this discounted price." data-dimension25="$29.99">View Deal</a></p></div><p>This model has a USB-C cable that doubles as a loop, as well as additional USB-C and USB-A ports.

The order that Google was seeking to gain some leeway with concerned the proposed "changes" U.S. District Judge James Donato delivered in 2024. This is all wrapped up in the Epic v Google case, where the latter was accused of enacting anti-competitive practices via the Play Store.</p><p>As a result, Donato ruled that Google would have to make changes to get away from those anti-competitive practices, so third-party developers could place their apps on the Play Store more comfortably.</p><p>According to the publication, Google's attempt this year was because the company called Donato's previous ruling "unprecedented," as it could spur "security risks" and put it at a disadvantage." CNBC reiterates that Google has been ordered to allow the possibility for third-party developers to place their products on the Play Store for users to download. Additionally, Google was ordered to make its "Play app catalog available to competitors."</p><p>Google is likely chasing a freeze on these issues now because, as CNBC states, this checklist isn't supposed to go into effect until July 2026.</p><h2 id="a-long-and-storied-case-2">A long and storied case</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5" name="top-charts-play-store-s25-ultra" alt="Top Charts in the Play Store on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5bGn34kesYNpYY8YDgL4E5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been down this Epic v Google path for a few years now, and in August, it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/epic-games-for-android-available-google-store-ninth-circuit-ruling">ruled by the Ninth Circuit</a> that Epic Games should be allowed on the Play Store. A jury had found Google guilty of illegally monopolizing "Android app distribution" and "in-app billing." Not only was Epic allowed to bring its Game Store to the Play Store, but the Ninth Circuit further ruled that Google should open its platform up to third-party developers.</p><p>Moreover, Google was "banned" from requiring consumers to go through its Play Billing services. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/now-google-has-removed-fortnite-its-play-store">notable issue</a> brought up throughout this lawsuit.</p><p>While the Ninth Circuit did side with Epic earlier this year, it was reported that Google could seek the "Full" Ninth Circuit to chase a different, likely more favorable, ruling. We've now seen its quest with the U.S. Supreme Court come up empty, so it remains to be seen what else comes of this lawsuit. There are still some things about Judge James Donato's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store-ruling-the-good-the-unfair-and-the-unlikely">previous ruling</a> that might not happen, but more information is likely to come.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Such features include video history search, home automation creation, and more.</p><p>While this seems exciting, it seems this "early access" truly is early, as some users report varying experiences with certain features.</p><p>The user reports that nothing has changed in the Home app. Additionally, "Ask Home" isn't appearing, and Gemini for speakers isn't available yet, either. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1o06cy5/comment/ni784m6/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Another user</a> who signed up for early access also gained entry, and they report that Ask Home is only working from the app. They add that Gemini is coming to speakers "on the 28th" for early access users.</p><p>Others reported that they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1o06cy5/comment/ni8vxg5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">haven't received</a> the promised AI-enhanced camera features; however, it seems that Google added them within the app's menus.

More importantly, many of Google's pre-existing smart home devices are accepted in this early access period, such as the Home Mini (first gen), Home Max, Next Hub, Nest Hub Max, and more.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">announced Gemini for Home</a> at the beginning of October, which is the start of the company's new outlook on smart homes and how to make living a little easier and safer. The announcement started with new products, as the company launched new Nest Cams (indoor and outdoor) and a new Doorbell with upgraded 2K HDR video capabilities.</p><p>The other side of this was the all-new Google Home Speaker, a device that embodies Gemini completely.  Gemini for Home isn't just about its newest products; it's about more intelligent alerts with video previews, Home Brief, the Ask Home AI feature, and more. Some of these features will require a subscription to utilize once this is all completed and available for all users.</p><p>At the time, Google said it would begin an early access period to begin testing Gemini for Home with its current lineup before the Home Speaker launches next year. We're now seeing that slowly beginning now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

User will reportedly be able to choose from several screening levels, including scanning all calls, unknown numbers, spam and scam calls, international numbers, or only hidden caller IDs.</p><p>So far, the automatic call screening feature has only been spotted in the Korean build of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-could-finally-match-google-pixel-update-pace-with-one-ui-8-5">One UI 8.5</a>, but it's likely that Samsung is working on expanding it to English and other languages before launch. After all, the company still has plenty of time to refine the feature ahead of next year's rumored rollout.</p><p>Additionally, Samsung will reportedly allow users to activate automatic call screening while Do Not Disturb is enabled, and to select a preferred language for call handling.</p><p>That said, it's great to see Samsung adopting one of the most useful features from Google's Pixel lineup. Soon, more flagship Android users will be able to enjoy the convenience of letting their phones handle unwanted calls automatically.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But it seems that may not be the case after all.</p><p>In a brief <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHNHZoW-sdI&t=1790s">conversation with The Verge</a>, Google Home's chief, Anish Kattukaran, shared some insight into the future of Nest Hub and smart displays in general. While he didn't explicitly confirm that a new model is in development, his comments strongly suggest that something could be in the works.</p><p>Kattukaran said Google is "definitely committed to smart displays," adding that while the company isn't "announcing anything new now," users should "definitely expect that we'll have news to share there."</p><p>He also pointed out that smart displays present "an incredible form factor to interact with something like Gemini for Home." With a screen, speaker, and microphone, they "complement a voice modality," allowing users to visualize information and interact more naturally. According to Kattukaran, this makes smart displays "almost the ultimate form factor to deliver a really great home experience."</p><h2 id="smart-displays-might-still-have-a-future-at-google-2">Smart displays might still have a future at Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="adf9ScsRYUR85Ycri2redN" name="google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2025" alt="Google Nest Hub 2nd gen with time and wallpaper displayed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/adf9ScsRYUR85Ycri2redN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, while he didn't explicitly confirm that a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-should-build-new-nest-hub-with-gemini">Nest Hub is on the way</a>, his remarks suggest Google hasn't abandoned the idea of a smart display entirely. For now, though, there's no concrete sign of active development on such a device.</p><p>That said, it's been years since Google last released a new Nest Hub. The first-generation model launched in 2018, followed by the second-generation version in 2021. The company briefly introduced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/possible-nest-hub-max-refresh-spotted">larger Nest Hub Max</a> in between, but never followed it up.</p><p>Then came the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Pixel Tablet</a>, which was nothing but a hybrid device that doubled as a smart display when docked, but Google eventually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-future-pixel-tablet-cancellation-rumors">discontinued its next-gen version</a> as well.</p><p>It has long seemed like Google was ready to move on from the smart display form factor, but Kattukaran's comments suggest otherwise. And even though the current Nest Hub lineup is set to gain Gemini integration, it's clear the category is overdue for a true next-generation upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There is something important to note: this will only last until December 9. Students in Canada have from October 7 to December 9 to sign up for the AI Pro Plan free of charge, and this subscription will last them for a full year. Moreover, students must be 18 years old or older.</p><p>After this full year is completed, Google states the AI Pro Plan will charge users CA $26.99 unless you've canceled.</p><p>College students in Canada will receive quite a few features in this AI Pro Plan, such as "expanded access" to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>. Gemini flexes its ability to answer complex questions and even to understand photos given to it by the user. Google states students can query Gemini about their homework and receive writing help "unlimitedly."</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/notebooklm-can-now-help-you-discover-sources-on-the-web">NotebookLM</a> access is another key feature in the AI Pro Plan. This "companion" can turn itself into an "expert" in whatever material you feed it. If you're working on a history paper, NotebookLM can help sift through those lengthy notes and guide you through the most important parts. NotebookLM is also capable of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">creating audio</a> and video overviews for even more assistance.</p><p>There's also no getting around the fact that students in Canada are always creating new documents.

Lastly, Deep Research in Gemini 2.5 Pro helps users go further with their research with "custom research reports" sourced from "hundreds of sites." This also goes hand-in-hand with Google's Guided Learning, which is also available for the AI Pro Plan. With Guided Learning, the AI will help coach students <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/guided-learning/">along with step-by-step explainers</a> on how to solve difficult school problems.</p><p>As previously stated, college students in Canada have from today (Oct 7) to December 9 to sign up for the AI Pro Plan at no cost for one year.</p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/college-students-get-google-ai-pro-plan-free-with-gemini-2-5-pro-announced">made a similar announcement</a> in July, but this didn't concern users in Canada, unfortunately. The original run regarded the U.S., Japan, Indonesia, Korea, and Brazil. College students in those countries could sign up for the same plan and receive the same AI-powered goodies for one full year before the payments begin.</p><p>This announcement also came shortly after Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-2-5-flash-lite-generally-available-fastest-cost-efficient-series-version">Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite model</a> was launched in "general availability."

Still, the intermittent use of the charging case can get users up to 26 hours of playtime, while five minutes of charging will restore about an hour of playback time.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-2025-quick-links-17">Prime Big Deal Days 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

After nearly a year of travel involving six countries, the charger is still pristine, and it continues to deliver the same reliable charging. Best of all, it lets me charge Samsung phones at 45W, making it the right charger to use with my Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>Basically, if you need a new GaN charger this Prime Day, you should just get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Charger-Compact-MacBook-Pixelbook/dp/B0CCVQB7MY/">100W Nexode Pro while it's still on sale at $49</a>.</p><h2 id="your-guide-to-all-the-deals-live-right-now-2">Your guide to all the deals live right now: </h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The package comes with four eartip size options, and Google says it developed the shape of the devices based on 45 million data points from different ears and ear shapes. Additionally, the company notes that the buds' Silent Seal 2.0 design can cancel up to twice as much as the previous generation of Pixel Buds.</p><p>They also offer up to 8 hours of battery life when using ANC, or up to 12 when not using the feature, while utilizing the charging case intermittently can get users up to 30 hours of listening before needing to recharge the case.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A big part of that has to do with the hardware; the brand now offers one of the best hardware packages in its class, and that has led to models like the DXP4800 Plus rivaling sales of established servers, like the DiskStation DS923+ and DS925+.</p><p>The DXP4800 Plus is a 4-bay NAS with 10 Gigabit Ethernet connectivity, Intel's Pentium Gold 8505 platform, 8GB of RAM, a 128GB SSD, and dual M.2 slots. Basically, this is one of the fastest 4-bay models around, and while it usually retails for $69, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">buy it at just $559 as part of Prime Days savings</a>, making it a great bargain.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="0ac94d0e-a5db-47ee-9572-69509ecf8daf" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Newegg" data-dimension48="Newegg" data-dimension25="$559" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eBLhZ6uw96AikhxEmXqtZ7" name="dxp4800-plus-bg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eBLhZ6uw96AikhxEmXqtZ7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>There's a reason why the DXP4800 Plus is the best-selling 4-bay NAS on Amazon.

That makes a difference, as you'll want to use a powerful NAS that's designed to last up to a decade. In my usage, the DXP4800 Plus proved to be highly reliable, and I didn't see any issues whatsoever.</p><p>The software was barebones at launch, but UGREEN rolled out updates to address this. You'll need to use Docker to install utilities like Plex, and that's a good thing. While it isn't as easy to use as DiskStation Manager, it has greater extensibility, and you can even install TrueNAS Scale if you don't like the look of the pre-installed software ‚Äî that's a huge bonus.</p><p>In addition to the four drive bays, you can slot in two M.2 drives, and these can be used to store data. Overall, the DXP4800 Plus is my choice if you're looking to get a 4-bay NAS, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">Prime Day deal bringing it down to $559</a> means this is the ideal time to upgrade.</p> ]]></dc:content>

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds925-plus-review">tested the DiskStation DS925+</a> when it debuted earlier this year, and while I liked the changes to the hardware, Synology's HDD limitation ‚Äî where it disallowed any WD and Seagate drives from being used in the NAS ‚Äî ultimately made it a non-starter. The move meant that you couldn't use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-long-lasting-hard-drives-nas-synology-qnap">best NAS HDDs</a> with the DS925+, and this ultimately hurt the brand, allowing rivals like UGREEN to make considerable inroads.</p><p>Thankfully, Synology is making amends now; the brand is rolling out the DiskStation Manager 7.3 update, which removes the HDD limitation. This makes it possible to use WD Red, Seagate IronWolf, and any other NAS HDD with 2025 DiskStation models. The move also means that Synology's latest models are no longer hobbled, and I'm eager to get my hands on the new launches to see how they hold up against their predecessors. The caveat is that the M.2 drive limitation is still in effect, so you can only slot in Synology's SSDs to create storage pools.</p><p>The 2025 portfolio includes the 2-bay DiskStation DS225+ and DS725+, the 4-bay DiskStation DS425+ and DS925+, and the enthusiast models: DiskStation DS1525+ and DiskStation DS1825+. I tested the DS925+ and have the DS225+ and DS425+ on hand to test at the moment, and will share my opinion on these NAS models shortly.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day ends TONIGHT - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><p>To be clear, this limitation only affected the 2025 DiskStation models; earlier NAS servers didn't have this particular limitation. When I asked the brand about what HDD models it tested with its 2025 portfolio, I was told that DSM 7.3 removes any restrictions in this area, so any HDD will work with the latest NAS models. The best part is that this will extend to value-focused and J series models launching down the line:</p><p>"Synology is collaborating with drive manufacturers to expand the range of certified storage media, delivering more reliable options. In the meantime, 2025 model-year DiskStation Plus, Value, and J Series running DSM 7.3 will support installation and storage pool creation with third-party drives¬π. Together with the existing support for third-party drive migration, DSM will provide users with greater flexibility in managing their storage deployments."</p><p>In addition to lifting the HDD limitations, DSM 7.3 comes with new features in Synology Drive, email moderation in MailPlus, and security updates. To its credit, Synology clearly listened to user feedback by walked back its earlier policy, and the ability to use WD and Seagate drives on its latest NAS models puts the 2025 DiskStation models back into contention.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, Samsung didn't increase the price of its popular flip phone this year, which means that we can look forward to some sleek deals during Amazon Prime Big Deal days, like this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7JTH9GK">23% discount available now</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> normally retails for $1,099, which isn't too bad considering its closest competitor normally costs $200 more. However, at $250 off, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 can be had for just $849. It's not exactly cheap, but it's a great deal regardless, and cheaper than what you'd normally pay for a base Galaxy S25 or Pixel 10.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7K4BRZJ">512GB variant is also on sale</a>, reducing the original price of $1,219 to $919. Power users may want to consider this option, as it lacks support for microSD cards, which would provide expanded storage.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE ‚Äî see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-galaxy-z-flip-7-continues-to-undercut-its-closest-competition-2">The Galaxy Z Flip 7 continues to undercut its closest competition</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="428f8138-f605-4d59-8d5a-f4ae5879cfb6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $849" data-dimension48="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $849" data-dimension25="$849.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7JTH9GK" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb" name="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>This 23% discount on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 brings the phone to its lowest price since launch.

Firstly, at 6.5mm (13.7mm closed) when open, it's much thinner than its predecessor, which goes a long way to making it more pocketable. After all, flip phones become quite thick when closed, which some may find bothersome.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-benchmarked-exynos-2500">Exynos 2500</a> chipset powering the Galaxy Z Flip 7 may not be quite as powerful as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, but Android Central contributor Brady Snyder says that it performed well during his testing.</p><p>The main display is expansive, and the crease is nearly non-existent for anyone who might be concerned about that. Then there's the cover screen. At 4.1 inches, it's quite large, making it ideal for taking selfies, answering notifications, or playing supported games. You can actually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/first-things-to-do-with-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">use apps on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen</a>, although it will require some maneuvering. Still, it's a handy feature that not many people would know about the phone out of the box.</p><p>One UI has also come a long way, and Samsung has a robust feature set. You get access to Google's AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a>, plus Samsung's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> suite. This brings features like AI Select, live translation, image generation, smart replies, and more. And for better privacy, you can opt for on-device AI processing, meaning your data doesn't get sent to the cloud.</p><p>Another big plus is that anyone interested can also pick from an expansive selection of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cases">Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-screen-protectors">screen protectors</a>.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-7">Shop All Amazon Deals ‚Äî Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Eventually, I got sick of dealing with router issues, and just told everyone to get Google Nest Wi-Fi Pro routers ‚Äî that's a true story. They're so easy to use, requiring only two cables and a few taps in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home app for iOS or Android</a> to get started. My parents figured it out while I was across the country, and that's a testament to the Nest Wi-Fi Pro's ease-of-use.</p><p>The software experience gets better as you continue using the Nest Wi-Fi Pro. You can open up the Google Home app to test your entire network's connection, or even a specific access point. It'll let you know when something's not right automatically with a push notification. My Nest router usually lets me know when there's an outage before my internet service provider knows.</p><p>Within the app, you can control everything from the brightness of the status light to the network settings. There's even an option to restart a Wi-Fi access point remotely ‚Äî no more trying to unplug and plug in your router.</p><p>Notably, the Nest Wi-Fi Pro only supports Wi-Fi 6E, not the newer Wi-Fi 7 standard. That's a bit of a bummer, but Google's claimed top speeds of up to 5.4 Gbps will be more than enough for most people. It's over five times the speed of my own internet plan. Additionally, Wi-Fi 6E uses three frequency bands ‚Äî 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz ‚Äî to reduce interference and bring you faster real-world wireless speeds.</p><p>I have a 1-Gig plan, and routinely hit 900Mbps wireless speeds on my Nest Wi-Fi Pro network, which is pretty outstanding. That's exactly what you want to see as an Android user. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Google Pixel 10</a> supports Wi-Fi 6E, and the Google Pixel 10 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> all support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>.

At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-Membership-Porcelain/dp/B0CC63GZ3R"><strong>$109.95 (31% off)</strong></a>, it's a solid entry point to Fitbit insights in a lightweight band, and it can sync with your phone for Google Maps turn-by-turn arrows and YouTube Music controls. Still, we've seen it cheaper before ($99), and you can get a better value below this price from another brand: Amazfit.</p><p>As someone who reviewed the Charge 6 and dozens of other fitness watches and bands, my advice for anyone looking to spend $100 or less is to try the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YNMBX"><strong>Amazfit Active 2 for $80.74 (19% off)</strong></a> instead, or match the Charge 6 deal price with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ"><strong>Active 2 Premium for $109.99 (15% off)</strong></a>.</p><p>The Active 2 (43g) only weighs slightly more than the Charge 6 (31g), and in exchange, you get a 1.32-inch, 2,000-nit AMOLED display instead of a 1.04-inch, 450-nit strip with tiny notifications. Both have built-in GPS, but the Charge 6 only lasts 5 hours to the Active 2's 21 hours, and lacks an altimeter for good elevation tracking. The Active 2 even matches the Charge 6 with blood oxygen and skin temperature readings, while adding a mic & speaker for calls and commands!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="f3b45318-3585-4e87-9e5c-6db304340273" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension48="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension25="$80.74" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YNMBX" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="oxJNscDFhdNsubUbuhTRhh" name="Amazfit-Active-2-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxJNscDFhdNsubUbuhTRhh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazfit-Fitness-Tracker-Resistant-Silicone/dp/B0DT3YMDMZ" data-dimension112="f3b45318-3585-4e87-9e5c-6db304340273" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension48="Also: Amazfit Active 2 Premium: $129.99" data-dimension25="$80.74"><del>$129.99</del><strong> $109.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Not only is the Active 2 one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/amazfit/best-amazfit-smartwatches">best Amazfit watches</a> on the market for sheer value, but it's just a solid all-around fitness watch, with perks like GPS, Bluetooth calling, downloadable routes, and Zepp Coach daily run recommendations that you'd normally find on much pricier <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-running-watches">running watches</a>.</p><p>Its Prime Day price is less than $1 off from its previous all-time low ($79.99).

Most lightweight trackers don't have proper app smarts, let alone Google ones. So I don't mind if you ignore my recommendation and grab one of those instead, prioritizing comfort over better notifications and a more traditional watch design.</p><p>For now, the Charge 6 is an excellent, if limited, device with a small screen that takes getting used to.

Amazfit's Zepp Coaching isn't as polished, but you'll save more money in the long run by avoiding any Fitbit Premium dependence.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel 10 hasn't even been on store shelves for two months, and it's already getting a surprisingly good Prime Big Deal Days discount that we weren't expecting!</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> went on sale on August 28, retailing for $799. I thought that was a reasonable price, given the upgrades that come with it, but this 19% discount reduces the price by $150, meaning you can buy the Pixel 10 for nearly half of what you'd normally pay for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>.</p><p>But if 128GB isn't enough for you, you can still snag the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRK635/">256GB version for $175 off</a>, making it cheaper than the regular price of the 128GB version.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE ‚Äî see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="the-pixel-10-is-cheaper-than-ever-2">The Pixel 10 is cheaper than ever</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="c2debe29-69b1-4e5e-abc4-9508ecdbb4e8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $649" data-dimension48="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $649" data-dimension25="$649" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FFTRPM4K/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf" name="Google Pixel 10" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/roHfB8CwZvHJScuZ8TL6Bf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>We thought $799 was a reasonable price for the Pixel 10, but at 19% off, there's never been a better time to buy Google's latest flagship phone.

You may be tempted to splurge on a "Pro" phone, but the Pixel 10 offers most of what you'd find on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">premium siblings</a>. That includes a large battery, triple camera system with a telephoto lens, Qi magnetic charging, and the new Tensor G5 chipset powering all the new AI features.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">camera quality on the Pixel 10</a> is superb, and it receives a notable boost over the Pixel 9 thanks to the addition of a 5x telephoto camera. This means zoom images are clearer, even at night. New camera features, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-best-take-on-the-pixel-8">Auto Best Take</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-use-camera-coach">Camera Coach</a>, make it even easier to capture the perfect image, whether of you and your friends or of objects around you.</p><p>Beyond the camera, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> offers additional unique AI features and is designed for more proactive and ambient AI capabilities. Magic Cue is one such feature, surfacing recommendations and suggestions based on whatever you're doing or who you're talking to. Does someone need to know the details of an upcoming event? Your Calendar entry will be a click away, so you won't have to dig for it. Need to call the airline about your upcoming flight? Your booking details will appear on your screen so they're ready at a moment's notice.</p><p>And it's made even better thanks to a larger battery that easily lasts you all day. The Pixel 10 is also the first flagship Android phone with magnetic Qi2 charging, meaning you can use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a> without a case. Or, if you wanna protect your phone, there are still plenty of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-cases">great Pixel 10 cases</a> to pick from, including Google's own Pixelsnap cases.</p><h2 id="shop-all-amazon-deals-quick-links-12">Shop All Amazon Deals ‚Äî Quick Links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Not only that, but one color option gets a massive 24% discount on Amazon, meaning you're paying less than $1,000 for one of our favorite foldable phones.</p><p>And while Amazon offers some great discounts, Best Buy appears to be outdoing it with its own deals, with each color option receiving a 24% discount, which is over $300 off.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>Prime Day is LIVE ‚Äî see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><h2 id="my-favorite-flip-phone-just-hit-a-new-low-2">My favorite flip phone just hit a new low</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9afde387-71d5-48fd-8cac-b06cb9966c9a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $984.99" data-dimension48="Price check ‚Äî Best Buy: $984.99" data-dimension25="$984.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F2GR6D1D" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="h8NADmDNduWhr7gwZHd5f5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-official-render-Scarab-5" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h8NADmDNduWhr7gwZHd5f5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 just hit its best price on Amazon, with a 25% discount on the Pantone Scarab colorway, slashing its exorbitant price down to something much more manageable.

The expansive cover screen makes it easy to use all my favorite apps without having to open the phone. It also lets me take the best selfies and lets others preview themselves before I capture a photo.

The Razr Ultra 2025 features a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chip, a massive 18GB of RAM, and a minimum of 512GB of storage (up to 1TB). It's quite the powerhouse! Motorola also managed to stuff a 4,700mAh battery inside to keep it going all day, and 68W charging means you can top it up at no time at all. The specs alone are why you should pick the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-vs-motorola-razr-ultra-2025">Razr Ultra 2025 over the Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>.</p><p>You also get access to Google AI features like Circle to Search and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a>, as well as Motorola's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI suite</a> for image generation, text summarization, and more.</p><p>Pantone Scarab is one of my favorite colors, as it features a beautiful green hue and soft Alcantara fabric that feels absolutely marvelous in the hand.

I use a pair of JBL Stage 2 bookshelf speakers for my vinyl record setup, and have owned various models of the brand's Go, Clip, Flip, Charge, and Pulse wireless portable speakers. After trying them all, I find myself coming back to the Go 3 for its size and affordability.</p><p>It's the smallest of JBL's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">portable Bluetooth speakers</a>, and that means it won't sound as loud or as crisp as bigger and more-expensive models. However, this is meant to be a cheap and durable speaker that can survive bike rides, runs, or beach and pool trips with ease. It can fit in a pocket or be easily clipped onto a bag or electric scooter, making the Go 3 a portability champion.</p><p>As the name suggests, the JBL Go 3 is a Bluetooth speaker designed to be used on-the-go, and it's incredibly handy for doing just that. I'd recommend it for use as a beach or pool speaker, or even for runners and hikers ‚Äî it's small enough to comfortably fit in the palm of your hand.

But this time around, the "Plus" model was skipped over.</p><p>On the bright side, the Tab S10 Plus is still getting basically all of the new software features that Samsung introduced. Really, the only thing you aren't getting is the newly redesigned S Pen that Samsung includes with both the Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

On a related note, the AI can lean on Spotify's music library for users asking about new music from their favorite artists.</p><p>Whatever you ask ChatGPT to do, whether it's surfacing a certain selection of playlists or asking it to create a playlist full of popular Latin artists, it will surface Spotify's results in the app. Users will see what resembles a Spotify widget in the app. The post states users can tap individual tracks, which will toss them into the Spotify app. However, if you've asked ChatGPT to create a new playlist for you, there will be an "Open in Spotify" option, so you can see everything as it is in the app.</p><h2 id="spotify-in-ai-2">Spotify in AI</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm" name="spotify-chatgpt-prompt-example" alt="Spotify in ChatGPT lets users link the music platform to the AI app, enabling playlist creation, recommendations, new music ideas, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mPd3b4VhMPWt8fuWu8Y2Wm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Spotify)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the ChatGPT app, the post states free, Plus, and Pro accounts can utilize Spotify, so long as they're signed in. This feature is reportedly arriving in over 145 countries this week on Android and iOS.</p><p>It seems fitting that Spotify would lend its musical knowledge to OpenAI's ChatGPT app, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-spotify-extension-rollout-detailed">it did the same thing</a> with Google's Gemini.

In the Gemini app, users can tell the AI to play a specific album, playlist, or ask it to play a song by a specific artist.</p><p>On a grander note, Spotify finally (finally) launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-lossless-listening-premium-subscribers-hear-every-refined-note-launch">Lossless Listening</a> feature for Premium subscribers in September. While the music you'll hear will be more refined and rich, Lossless Listening comes at the cost of siphoning even more data, so it's worth expressing caution if you're not listening on a Wi-Fi connection. Lossless Listening is available in private playlists and Liked Songs, as well as DJ, Jam, Mix, AI Playlists, and Daylists.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This means even the new Samsung Galaxy S25 FE, which just launched a month ago, is also seeing a massive price drop, so be sure to grab this<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"> <strong>$150 off deal</strong></a> now!</p><p>The Galaxy S25 FE prides itself as being a device that comes baked with the stable version of One UI 8, even before it landed on the flagship Galaxy S25 series, which is pretty neat as you get the latest UI right out of the box! The device features a large 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a 120Hz refresh rate. And you also get thinner bezels, which means more screen space to binge on your favorite shows or games.</p><p>While the device is the same size as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, which means it's bigger than the standard Galaxy S25, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-fe-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-hands-on">is the slimmest and lightest FE phone from Samsung ever,</a> measuring just 7.4mm thin and weighing 190 grams.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1133px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN" name="Samsung Galaxy S25 FE in Icyblue" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WCq9VRVaWyw99hnrXeEhMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1133" height="1133" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 FE:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1" data-dimension112="16aaeafb-a81d-4884-91ff-6347aa27ebb9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$649.99" data-dimension48="$649.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$649.99</del></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FG1V92LT?th=1"><strong>499.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 FE sports an upgraded chipset, a sleeker design, and a bigger battery with faster charging.

Amazon also upgraded the E Ink display on the new units, improving the refresh rate and adding a color option (which costs even more, by the way).</p><p>The new Scribes come with 32gb or 64GB of storage, while the 2024 model offers a 16GB option for less. If you don't plan on filling it up with a bunch of apps, that 16GB model is just fine.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4" name="amazon-kindle-scribe-2024-lifestyle-render.jpg" alt="Amazon Kindle Scribe 2024 lifestyle render" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5jGLPvBh6GbbpU6qxdWXe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's, of course, thinner and lighter than the old model too, but I think that's where the big improvements stop. The new 2025 Kindle Scribe features smaller, uniform bezels, but I personally don't want that in a digital notebook.</p><p>I love the large side bezel of the Kindle Scribe models on sale because it provides a comfortable place to hold the tablet while writing. Remember, this is a writing tablet by nature, not a smaller device that you're going to be holding up on the beach for hours.</p><p>And if you were thinking of really splurging to get that color Kindle Scribe model, I'd say hold off for reviews before you plunge in. Color e-readers might be cool but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/black-and-white-e-readers-arent-obsolete-yet">they're not necessarily better</a>, as I've found out after testing dozens of them.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

When cellular connectivity drops during a disaster, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">like it did on the Verizon network during Hurricane Helene in 2024</a>, it can impact people in need, first responder communications, and slow relief efforts. Roughly a year after the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene, I got a firsthand look at how Verizon responds to tragedies nationwide and keeps cell service active.</p><p>There's a team within <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/verizon-wireless">Verizon</a> that you might not have heard of called Verizon Frontline. Its purpose isn't to sell you cell phone plans or offer you a trade-in deal, but rather to develop and deploy assets that can help first responders in emergency situations. It's a collaborative effort between government agencies and the Frontline team to share technologies first responders didn't know they needed, and create assets first responders think would be helpful.</p><p>That includes emerging technologies you might not expect to be useful during a disaster, such as AI, robotic dogs, drones, and more.</p><h2 id="new-problems-for-disaster-relief-2">New problems for disaster relief </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ" name="Verizon-Frontline-Truck-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qDzpfWvXjmmFVDnBRazEPZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Climate change is forcing emergency management departments and carrier teams like Verizon Frontline to adjust. Previously, there were narrower locations and seasons where you might expect disasters like hurricanes, wildfires, or tornadoes to strike. The situation is different now, with hurricanes striking in areas not prepared for them, and wildfire season in some areas of the U.S. becoming year-round.</p><p>This partly explains why Hurricane Helene was so devastating in states like North Carolina and Tennessee. In that instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/is-verizon-down-for-you-youre-not-alone">a major Verizon outage coincided with relief efforts</a> that appeared unrelated to the hurricane itself. These situations are where Verizon Frontline aims to fill the gap ‚Äî this team within the carrier has over 600 mobile assets scattered nationwide that can sprout temporary networks and connectivity in an emergency.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U" name="Verizon-Frontline-Large-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KZJtbeMUUYmRZrYsriqJ4U.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One type of asset, called the Satellite Pico-cell on Trailer (SPOT), can be set up in roughly an hour and offers a few different ways of getting people online. The trailer supports multiple low-earth orbit satellite connectivity options, including Verizon's own satellites and Starlink. After the initial setup process, it can support up to 128 simultaneous users over Wi-Fi and also broadcasts cellular service over the Verizon network.</p><p>The small and versatile form factor of the SPOT allows it to be deployed almost anywhere and run for three days on its own power, thanks to a 30-gallon diesel fuel tank.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX" name="Verizon-Frontline-Small-Trailer-1" alt="Verizon Frontline equipment on display at the Philadelphia Roadshow." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9eEk2KSUFXf6uYCrhByFzX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All the Verizon Frontline equipment I saw firsthand prioritizes redundancy, whether it's a small asset like the Rapid Response Connectivity Unit (RRCU) pictured above or a full-fledged trailer. The RRCU, despite being much smaller than the SPOT and quicker to deploy, can still broadcast Wi-Fi and cell signals in areas where traditional towers are unreachable.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/verizon-outage-hurricane-helene-showcase-importance-of-satellite-connectivity">we covered Hurricane Helene</a>, we emphasized the importance of satellite connectivity. It's unsurprising that Verizon Frontline is trusting LEO satellite connectivity to power many of its assets, but the implementation is clever. Aside from the larger trailers, the company is also putting satellite internet dishes and receivers on things you wouldn't expect, like off-road vehicles and robot dogs.</p><div class="inlinegallery

Currently, I'm keeping an iPhone Air in my left pocket and a Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in my right pocket, and the latter has been my daily driver for months. Whatever your stance on thin-and-light smartphones is, a common criticism has been their pricing. It's hard to pay a premium when there are considerable compromises, but now you don't have to thanks to killer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays">Amazon Prime Big Deal Days</a> sales.</p><p>I paid for both my iPhone Air ($1,199) and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge ($1,099) in full, and I regret to inform you that the Galaxy S25 Edge is now at a painfully-low price. My loss is your gain: you can snag a 256GB Galaxy S25 Edge for only $684.99, down from a full retail price of $1,099. To put that in perspective, the discount is over $400 and 38% off, and it's literally lower than the MSRP of a base-model Galaxy S25.</p><p>In other words, if you've been cautiously intrigued by thin phones like the Galaxy S25 Edge, this is your chance to snag one at a major discount with no strings attached ‚Äî here's why you should.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><em><strong>October Prime Day is LIVE - see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-official-render-titanium-silver" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4R8Syy78oyWM3AN6qWAwGf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="3000" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge 256GB:</strong>¬†<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Processor-ProScaler-Manufacturer/dp/B0DYVPJ5KD/r" target="_blank" data-dimension112="769257a5-8b01-405f-9169-6cd9fc4efe39" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099.99" data-dimension48="$1,099.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$1,099.99</del> <strong>$684.99 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review" target="_blank"><strong>Android Central rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê</strong>‚≠ê</a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is the most versatile slim phone on the market today.

The bit of extra thinness, smaller form factor, and interesting camera plateau design makes the Air feel more exciting and different to me. However, I'm well aware that all of those reasons are also reasons why the average consumer probably shouldn't buy one.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> manages to get pretty thin at 5.8mm without feeling much different from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship Android smartphone</a>. It still has a premium AMOLED 6.7-inch display, the best Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset, and a dual-camera system on the back. In my performance and benchmark testing, I've found that the Galaxy S25 Edge is not only faster than the iPhone Air, but also handles thermal throttling and overheating better.</p><p>With One UI 7 out of the box (and upgradeable to One UI 8), the Galaxy S25 Edge isn't lacking in the software department. I won't tell you whether One UI 8 is better than iOS 26 ‚Äî that's subjective, and Liquid Glass is controversial ‚Äî but it's my favorite Android skin from Samsung and comes with seven years of guaranteed software updates.</p><p>The cameras are another separator. I think both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> and Galaxy S25 Edge have great main cameras, but Samsung's thin phone crucially adds an ultrawide lens. Just before I picked up my iPhone Air, I used the ultrawide lens on the Galaxy S25 Edge to take a wide shot at a concert, and realized just how important that secondary camera can be. While there's no telephoto on either, both have 2x "optical-quality" zoom, so Samsung's offering actually has 0.6x, 1x, and 2x options ‚Äî superb for a slim device.</p><p>Overall, it's clear to me that the Galaxy S25 Edge is the more versatile device. At under $700 for a limited time during Prime Day, it's a no-brainer if you're even remotely excited by slim hardware. It's far less than I paid, and I'm quite happy with my purchase, so your deal will be even better.</p><h2 id="october-prime-day-quick-links-12">October Prime Day - quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

It's available in several different configurations, with this deal specifically being for the 12GB/128GB model in the Retro Power colorway.</p><p>That's part of what makes this deal so enticing, as AYANEO's Retro Power colorway is usually highly sought after and difficult to acquire. This has been a continuing trend for years, including the upcoming dual-screen AYANEO Pocket DS, which shares the same chip as the Pocket S.</p><p>Since reviewing the Pocket S, it remains a staple in my arsenal of Android gaming handhelds, as the premium design is genuinely enjoyable to use. If anything, my biggest complaint is that I wish the ergonomics were a bit better, but AYANEO does offer a grip case that alleviates some of those issues.</p><p>In the event that you <em>really </em>want handheld with better ergonomics and an OLED panel, the AYANEO Pocket EVO is also on sale. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/AYANEO-Pocket-Android-Handheld-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHVKTJ3F/">8GB/128GB model is down to $429</a>, which is even less than what the Pocket S is going for.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Audio accessories like Bluetooth speakers and headphones for your PlayStation 5 might be on the list. I'm here to tell you to save your money and spend some spare pocket change on something better.</p><p>Sony doesn't allow you to connect any first-party or third-party audio accessories to the PS5 via the console's Bluetooth. There's actually a good reason for that, but more on that later. The most crucial bit of information is this: you don't need to splurge hundreds of dollars just to get a dedicated Bluetooth speaker or pair of headphones that'll rely on an adapter or cable anyway!</p><p>Instead, you can get the UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 and use any of your existing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-speakers">Bluetooth speakers</a>, headphones, or earbuds with your PlayStation 5. It doesn't even reduce the audio quality, because this super affordable dongle has the latest specifications that allow for high-quality audio playback. You can get it for even cheaper with this Prime Big Deal Days offer, saving you $8.40 so you can grab the dongle for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7CKV1J8/"><strong>$21.59 at Amazon</strong></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="fdbcd0bb-b0b8-43cc-bd76-56de90722445" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 üì∫The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is a simple bridge between your PlayStation 5 and all your Bluetooth speakers and headphones.

The answer can be found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.ie/electronics/support/articles/00302454">Sony's own support forum</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>Well, the reason the PS5 doesn‚Äôt support Bluetooth Audio connections is because of possible latency performance and bandwidth. Bluetooth is a wonderful technology with an ever-increasing potential, but it currently comes with important limitations when gaming.</p></blockquote></div><div><blockquote><p>As your wireless controller connects through Bluetooth to the PS5, it already takes up Bluetooth bandwidth, and adding wireless audio might lead to minute audio delays, impacting your gaming experience. The same applies to Bluetooth speakers. That‚Äôs why gaming headsets such as the Sony INZONE models use a USB dongle (or are wired).</p></blockquote></div><p>As frustrating as it may sound, wired headphones aren't always an option. Not everyone has a pair, and not everyone is looking to buy one just to use with their gaming console. I found myself in this conundrum, wishing to use the spectacular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/four-months-with-the-marshall-kilburn-iii">Marshall Kilburn III</a> with the PS5.</p><p>Sony recommends Bluetooth adapters, and I was looking for a quick solution. That's when I came upon this excellent dongle from UGREEN. The price is too good to pass on, even without the Amazon Prime Big Deal Days discount.</p><p>The UGREEN USB-C Bluetooth Adapter for PS5 is stupidly easy to set up and use. I was skeptic at first, I'm not going to lie, but the product worked just as smoothly as advertised. I highly recommend investing in one of these if you're in the same fix as I was.</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sony quotes up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge, and I can also verify that I generally only have to charge the XM4 about once per week.</p><p>The sound quality delivered by the Sony XM4 is immersive and balanced too, as I have used these cans for everything from acoustic folk and death metal albums to staff meetings and Red Dead Redemption 2.¬†</p><p>Sure, there are newer models to consider ‚Äî and both the XM5 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">XM6</a> might be better wireless headphones overall ‚Äî but for me, the Sony WH-1000XM4 hit that sweet spot. If you can afford them, go with the newer generations of Sony headphones, but if you're looking to save some cash this Prime Day, this is easily my favorite headphones deal of them all.</p><h2 id="prime-big-deal-days-quick-links-7">Prime Big Deal Days - Quick links</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Deal hunters are skipping the smaller discounts and going for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 at $149.99</strong></a>, an all-time low according to Camelcamelcamel, and you can bet stock will run out before Prime Day ends.</p><p>I've been covering Samsung deals for years, so I know that last year on Black Friday, the Galaxy Watch 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-6-hits-all-time-low-week-before-black-friday-2024">bottomed out at $149</a> before Samsung sold off its stock for good and pivoted to the Watch 7.

It's due to receive more software support, and its One UI Watch build has smooth software and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-galaxy-watch-8-tiles-are-best-part-of-one-ui-8-watch">best Tiles</a> of any Wear OS watch.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazonprime" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon Prime 30-day FREE trial: Most deals are Prime-exclusive</strong></a></li><li><strong>See all the Prime Day deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank"><strong>USA</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>UK</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/" target="_blank"><strong>Canada</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank"><strong>India</strong></a></li><li><strong>Rival sales:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/electronics/top-deals/pcmcat1563299784494.c" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/shop/deals" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://deals.dell.com/en-us/category/top-deals" target="_blank"><strong>Dell</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.newegg.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Newegg</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop" target="_blank"><strong>HP</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.target.com/c/top-deals/-/N-4xw74" target="_blank"><strong>Target</strong></a></li><li><strong>Phone deals:¬†</strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all" target="_blank"><strong>Walmart</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1" target="_blank"><strong>Amazon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/" target="_blank"><strong>Verizon</strong></a><strong>¬†|¬†</strong><a href="https://www.att.com/" target="_blank"><strong>AT&T</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Thankfully, three universally-loved BoboVR headstraps are on sale for Prime Day, with the classic style coming in at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR"><strong>an incredible $39.99</strong></a> out the door. This sale ends October 8, 2025, so be sure to jump on the deal ASAP before it's gone!</p><p>BoboVR's headstraps are stupid comfortable and all come with a brilliant hot-swappable, magnetically detachable, rechargeable battery pack that'll add about 2 hours to your headset's playtime. Since you can hot-swap these, it's easy to grab a few additional batteries and lengthen your sessions, or just drop a battery on if you somehow forgot to keep your headset charged.</p><p>All three of these amazing headstraps <strong>will work on a Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S</strong>. Here's how to choose between the three options this Prime Day:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/primebigdealdays"><strong>Prime Day is BACK October 7th and 8th - see the full list of deals</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="48b8cedc-8551-4c18-aa13-b847dab8549a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="üîã - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension48="üîã - BoboVR charger + extra battery: $39.99" data-dimension25="$39.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CJLG9SBR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm" name="bobovr-m3-pro-render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMFieoeEuwBoQyxT3tmpMm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>The classic BoboVR headstrap design is also known as a "halo-style strap" and includes a plush forehead pad and angled, flexible plastic strap that wraps another plush cushion around your head. It's fully adjustable and can even be angled to fit any head shape or size, making it the best choice for most people.</p><p><strong>‚úÖRecommended if: y</strong>ou hate the pressure VR headsets can put on your face. This headstrap design removes all the weight from your face and evenly distributes it around your forehead and the base of your skull, instead.</p><p><strong>‚ùåSkip this deal if:</strong> you play a lot of active games or workout in VR. Since it doesn't pull the headset tightly onto your face, it can wobble a lot if you're flinging your head around constantly.

If you're looking for an option that has hot-swappable batteries, there's simply no better choice. Each battery pack is 5,000 or 10,000mAh in capacity, which will double or quadruple your Meta Quest 3 or 3S's playtime, respectively.</p><p>Those battery packs are all recharged via a simple USB-C port, so any old phone charger you have lying around will work. Each headstrap type comes with one battery, but you can always order extra to keep the fun going for longer. Check the blocks for each product above, as I linked the correct battery for each headstrap type.</p><p>Remember that while the batteries might be model-specific, all three of these straps work for either the Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S, so you can game in comfort even if you opted for the more economical Quest 3S model!</p><ul><li>For more on Prime Day 2025, check out¬†<a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-prime-day-ultimate-shopping-guide" target="_blank"><u><strong>our ultimate shopping guide</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This is because unlike the rest, the ROG Tessen can actually collapse and fold in half, making it great for throwing in your bag.

ASUS might've been able to push things a little further, but seeing as the Tessen connects to your phone using USB-C, it just wasn't possible.</p><p>With that USB-C port, it not only ensures ultra-low latency for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">mobile gaming</a>, but the ROG Tessen also allows for passthrough charging.

Sure, a color TV show or movie was an obvious upgrade from black & white from a fundamental perspective, but the quality of early color content simply didn't match the contrast of black & white programming.</p><p>Things were made worse by a lack of standards and difficult-to-use equipment. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskOldPeople/comments/v04vgr/comment/iaee72x/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">One Reddit user</a> remembers having to "twiddle knobs to decide whether the people would be orange or green."</p><p>In a way, color e-readers can suffer from similar problems but for very different reasons. I've been using the Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II as my main e-reader since the middle of August, and I've been extremely impressed with the unit.

The design has been refined to feel more comfortable in the hand, and the OS features new capabilities enabled by the updated display.</p><p>But anyone coming from an older black-and-white e-reader will immediately notice the graininess of the new color display. Flat white backgrounds now have an almost "old film" quality, giving the picture a distinct character that isn't present on digital stock. The same feeling can't be said for reading, where this grain can be distracting for some.</p><p>Text on the black-and-white Boox Page looks smooth and clean. Even when viewed through a macro lens, the Page's letters appear to be printed ink. However, the color screen has a distinct digital pixel look to each character.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-letters" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a few letters on screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fkz3xcNqwbQwY73Bfbyo89.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-white-background" alt="Comparing the screen quality of a white background between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5n3nCpRJ8XBpGkt3tPWE59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59" name="onyx-boox-page-vs-go-color-7-gen-2-icons" alt="Comparing the screen quality between the Onyx Boox Page and Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GjfUMuMPibK7oiWLr66U59.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some people, this won't be a big deal.

That's made up for by the addition of color and a substantially better refresh rate, making it more versatile.</p><p>I also love the design changes, from the new button layout to the rough paper-like feeling on the back. At 7 inches, it remains a Goldilocks size for an e-reader since it's about the size of the average novel and is more comfortable to hold long-term than having to fold back a spine. Overall, a fantastic choice for an e-reader upgrade, so long as you don't mind the less paper-like display.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2fbefb4e-c054-44de-9deb-eaccc59c4ce9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P3dSym2GfCmLD7t3pS4XzS.jpg' alt="An official product render of an Onyx Boox Go Color 7 Gen II with a colorful sketch on the screen"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Onyx Boox Color Go 7 Gen II</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>E Ink is already gorgeous, but when you add color to it, things get really impressive.

Your phone is optimized to do as much as it can while using as little power as possible, but it's still a very energy-hungry piece of electronics. We drain our battery so quickly because we use our phone excessively. If we use it less, we will have to charge it less.</p><p>Having said to horrible part out loud, there are things that can make a difference. For some of us, every tiny difference matters, so here's what you can do <em>without</em> putting your phone away.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-adaptive-brightness" alt="Enabling Adaptive Brightness on a Samsung Galaxy S24 FE" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kPyRVpvHn369kWqB9awZp3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Dim your screen:</strong> Most of us probably use some sort of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-even-dimmer-brightness-tile-spotted">adaptive brightness setting</a>, which can help, but I know at least a few of us have that display cranked up all the way all the time. That's a good way to tank your battery (and your eyes). The best approach would be to set it to a manual setting and adjust it to be as dim as possible, while still being readable. Second best? Use the adaptive brightness feature that came with your phone.</p><p><strong>Choose a short screen time-out:</strong> Your phone's display shuts off after a set period of inactivity. You can set this time yourself in your display settings. The shorter the better, but I'd advise at least 30 seconds or less. It's easy to unlock your screen when you need to see it.</p><p><strong>Disable Always-On Display (AOD): </strong>While convenient for checking the time and notifications, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-will-finally-bring-always-display-its-phones-year">Always-On Display</a> constantly uses a small amount of power. Turning this off is a simple way to save a significant amount of battery over the course of a day.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7" name="airplane-mode.jpg" alt="Airplane mode toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Only use the wireless radios you need:</strong> There is no reason to leave Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or GPS on if you know you won't need them. All these use battery, and you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-quick-settings-your-notification-drawer-android-pie">easily toggle them on and off</a>.</p><p><strong>Turn off a poor connection:</strong> If you're somewhere with Wi-Fi and your network connection is poor, shut it down. Activate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-why-use-airplane-mode-during-flights" target="_blank">Airplane mode</a> or turn off mobile data, then manually enable Wi-Fi. The cellular radio uses more energy than most people realize, and a poor connection consumes significantly more of it.</p><p><strong>Check your location settings:</strong> Your phone will scan for nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth access points to assist in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whats-difference-between-precise-and-approximate-location-android-12">getting a more precise location</a>, and that can use some of your precious battery juice. Note that <strong>these scans occur even if Wi-Fi is turned off</strong>, unless your location settings are configured correctly. Yes, things aren't as accurate, but they're usually precise enough.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Check your apps: </strong>We all want the apps we use to be ready instantly, and that means that many of them work in the background, at least some of the time. That's fine if it's an app you actually use, but what about all that garbage that came with your phone that you'll never open? Uninstall them if possible, disable them if not, and if you're forced to leave them running, remember this the next time you choose which brand of phone to buy.</p><p><strong>Uninstall any apps you installed and never use:</strong> The same reason above applies here. Apps that came with your phone can usually do a lot more than ones you installed yourself, but those can still drain your battery. If you don't want it, trash it.</p><p><strong>Use your phone's battery management features:</strong> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/youre-using-ai-all-the-time-and-might-not-even-know-it">Your phone utilizes AI</a> to "learn" which apps you use most frequently and which ones are most critical to its functionality. These apps are left to do mostly their own thing, but the rest of them are throttled down to use a lot less battery. It really does work. While you're in there, be sure to set your phone to enter battery-saving mode when the percentage drops below a certain point.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX" name="UGREEN-Uno-2-in-1-Magnetic-Wireless-Charger-15W-lifestyle-4.jpg" alt="UGREEN Uno 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charger 15W" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CHdefhY9i6jJTV9GQ2AGdX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3299" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate to say it, but these tips really won't make a huge difference. The best thing to do is find a phone that can do what you need it to do, as long as you need it to do so. Phones get better every year, and the battery life of a phone in 2025 is miles better than one from just a few years ago.</p><p>One last tip from me that many people overlook is the use of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-wireless-chargers">wireless chargers</a>. A wireless charger can charge your phone from zero to full, but it's best used another way: to maintain the charge. When my phone isn't in my hand or pocket, it's sitting on a wireless charger. Since making this adjustment, I can't remember a time when my phone died before I expected it‚Äînot counting the Pixel 4, because, well, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-phones-pick-new-features-start-june">if you had one, you know</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>
