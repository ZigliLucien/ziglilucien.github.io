And while it's great being able to play games right on your phone, it's not the most comfortable experience. Even just playing games for a few minutes usually ends up with me either being annoyed that my fingers are in the way or my wrists start to bother me. Thankfully, I have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a> at my disposal, and now you can get one too, as it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN/"><strong>dropped to its lowest price ever</strong></a> as part of Amazon's Big Spring Sale.</p>

The GameSir G8 Plus manages to do just that, offering a comfortable mobile gaming experience that I've yet to be able to replicate with anything else. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bluetooth-Controller-iOS-Wireless-Joysticks-Minecraft/dp/B0D8JJRCJN/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1ca339df-7101-4a63-b94e-b53f138634ae" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="GameSir G8 Plus: $79.99" data-dimension48="GameSir G8 Plus: $79.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Heading into 2025, things were looking pretty bleak for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Android emulation</a> scene. Nintendo took down multiple Switch emulators, and there just wasn't much progress being made for other platforms. Fast forward to today, and while things are looking slightly better on the Switch front, it's also now possible to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3</a> AND Windows games right on your phone.</p><p>Of course, after you get everything set up, using the on-screen controls isn't exactly ideal. This is just one of the reasons why I always recommend picking up a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-controllers-android">game controller</a> that you can use to create a Switch-like mobile gaming experience.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While there's definitely no shortage of options to choose from, the GameSir G8 Plus is always the first controller I recommend. For one, it works with practically every device that I have, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a> with its enormous 14.6-inch display.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is going to use a tablet of that size to play games, but it does speak to the versatility offered by the G8 Plus. Speaking of which, one of the big reasons why I prefer the G8 Plus over the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">G8 Galileo</a> (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/GameSir-G8-Galileo-Controller-Joysticks/dp/B0CM3C9HRG/">which is also on sale</a>) is that I don't have to worry about the USB-C port getting in the way. This way, I can slot in my phone, start playing, and then stop playing just as quickly.</p>

<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> is gaining a few new features on Android that make customizing your personalized radio stations and playlist cover art easier. "Ask Music," a feature that lets users create custom stations based on their mood using simple prompts, can now be further refined after the first try. It's rolling out this week for YouTube Premium subscribers in supported regions.</p><p>The process for creating <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-testing-letting-you-build-custom-radio-stations-using-ai-prompts">Ask Music</a> starts with a prompt that describes their mood, like the examples YouTube provides of "upbeat workout tracks" or "relaxing jazz." From there, you'll get a custom radio station that helps with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">discovery of the streaming service's 100-million-track catalog</a>.</p><p>What's new with YouTube Music's latest update is the ability to further refine Ask Music radio stations after the initial prompt. Users can tweak their personalized radio stations by either typing or speaking additional prompts. The app will show chips with suggestion prompts to help YouTube Music users come up with ideas, such as "more upbeat," "just jazz songs" or "only female vocals."</p>

<p>Right now, YouTube says that Ask Music is only available for YouTube Music Premium subscribers in the following supported regions: U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. It'll work on both the Android and iOS mobile apps, too.</p><p>YouTube Premium subscribers in the U.S. will get one more exclusive feature, and that's AI-generated titles for My Mix playlist. Based on the songs included in the My Mix playlist, YouTube Music's AI will come up with a title that represents the mood and feel of the playlist.</p><p>Finally, YouTube Music is adding new support for custom cover art for playlists. There are two new AI-generated cover art themes — "Workout" and "Instruments" — that can be used to create unique artwork. Additionally, custom playlist thumbnails, which were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-custom-playlist-thumbnails">first available on the web</a>, are now supported on the Android app. They'll be launching on iOS in the coming months, per the company.</p><p>These updates are rolling out this week on the YouTube Music app for Android.</p>

It's not the lowest price we've seen the Pixel Watch 3, which dipped to $279 during Black Friday, but I can manage the $10 difference. Wear OS is largely devoid of good cheap smartwatches, so any discount is always worth looking at.</p>

<p>So why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>? Aside from it being one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>, my mother has been asking for new watch bands for her Fitbit, and being the loving son that I am, I would much rather upgrade her device instead. She has some fitness goals she's working toward, and a new smartwatch that integrates Fitbit and has access to her favorite music streaming services feels like a win.</p><p>Plus, she and I can have matching smartwatches. I've been using the Pixel Watch 3 since it launched in October, and I love this smartwatch. It's fluid, designed extremely well, and has a surprisingly impressive battery life. I also find the AI-generated workouts to be quite useful and a good motivation.</p>

<p>While I can't always get my mom the latest tech gadgets, she always appreciates when I can, and she always trusts my judgment. That's why I want to get her a couple of additional trinkets that I noticed are on sale for the Amazon Big Spring Sale.</p><p>She really enjoys listening to music whenever she's out and about, but she has bad luck choosing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a> that work well or fit her ears comfortably. That's why the Soundcore Sport X20 caught my eye, as they feature the ear hook design that she prefers.</p><p>They also have long battery life, IP68 water and dust resistance, and ANC, which is honestly pretty sweet for earbuds that you can get for just $64.</p>

<p>I'm also going to grab her the Anker Nano Power Bank. This is something I always like to point out whenever it's on sale because of how much I love this product. I carry it around with me all the time, and the built-in cord with the loop design comes in clutch!</p><p>With the 10,000mAh capacity, she'll have enough juice to power up her phone, new earbuds, and even my little brother's phone if he's been playing too many games on it. And the little display will always let her know how much power it has left or how long it will take to charge up a device.</p>

<ul><li>Pixel users took to Reddit to report a truly problematic issues regarding scheduled alarms.</li><li>Users state their alarms have surprisingly deactivated themselves, leading to many waking up late for work the following morning.</li><li>There's no clear cut culprit behind the problem; however, some think the March feature drop is the problem while others blame Gemini.</li><li>Another series of issues were reported earlier in March following the latest feature drop.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A surge of reports all contain users voicing issues with Google's recent Pixel flagships and alarms.</p><p>Many Google Pixel users took to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/all_of_my_alarms_turned_themselves_off_over_the/">respective subreddit</a> to begin reporting issues with their previously set alarms not going off as intended (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/google-pixel-failed-alarm-clock-reports/">9to5Google</a>). Posted two days ago, one user states their alarms on their Pixel never went off. In fact, they had set four alarms, and all four were "turned off," not dismissed. The user did some testing and stated they turned their alarms off and on, which seemingly worked the following day.</p><p>However, each alarm soon deactivated itself after that on the following day.</p><p>Users are scrambling to figure out what the issue is as others in the thread note a similar problem. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jir4tz/comment/mjha9mf/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states</a> they wonder if it has anything to do with a Gemini notification. Their post reads, "My initial assumption was that I told Gemini to stop a timer that was going off and it canceled all my alarms."</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today/?rdt=57617">separate thread</a> gives a little more clarity on the affected devices, as the original poster states their alarms didn't go off on a Pixel 9. The user states the alarm that was deactivated was for work throughout the week and had been "working for years until now." Several more users with a Pixel 9 series device report the same issue.</p><p>Curiously, other users state they've encountered these issues <em>after </em>downloading the latest March 2025 feature drop.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1jg2nz3/my_alarm_did_not_go_off_today">My alarm did not go off today.</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This is a truly strange problem going around. As always, even if you haven't experienced issues, please check your Pixel phone's alarms before you go to bed. Moreover, Google hasn't made a statement about this issue, but these user reports may get its attention and will (hopefully) lead to a future fix.</p><p>Users highlighting these alarm issues after the March feature drop makes sense <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">when you consider the struggles</a> some have been going through. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">update arrived</a> on March 4, but shortly after, users started reporting annoying brightness problems, audio issues, and inconsistent vibrations. The problem affected users with devices ranging from the Pixel 7 to the Pixel 9 series.</p><p>There were some band-aid fixes mentioned for the brightness and vibration issues, though. Similar to what we've seen reported with the Pixel alarms, another patch is expected to help give these users some relief.</p><p>Google's latest feature drop was packed with new features like scam detection in the Messages and Phone apps. The company also expanded its Satellite SOS support to more regions like Canada and Europe. Additionally, the Pixel Watch 3 gained Loss of Pulse and menstrual cycle tracking.</p>

<hr>
<p>Amid a little One UI 7 rollout confusion, Samsung is now bringing clarity to the specifics behind its next OS debut.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1904787401488080960">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the company has posted a detailed schedule of its One UI 7 rollout for several past-gen Galaxy devices (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/26/samsung-one-ui-7-schedule-dates/">9to5Google</a>). Samsung's Czech Republic website has posted the dates for which devices should begin expecting the major OS upgrade. The post states April 10 will mark the beginning of One UI 7's arrival on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-hands-on">Galaxy S24</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Flip 6</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Fold 6</a> in the region.</p><p>Officially, the Czech Republic's post states "a week later" (potentially April 17), the Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Flip 5, and Fold 5 will receive the update. This will then be followed by One UI 7's arrival on the S23 FE and the S22 "in the coming weeks," which is speculated to be late April.</p><p>Samsung's post lists its eligible Galaxy tablets separately, beginning with the Galaxy Tab S10 series, which should see One UI 7 in mid-April. Lastly, the Tab S9 and S8 series will grab it in late April.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Czech Republic: One UI 7 Rollout Schedule 📅 April 10 – Galaxy S24, Z Flip6 & Z Fold6 📅 Week Later– Galaxy S24 FE, S23 series, Z Flip5 & Z Fold5 📅 Late April – Galaxy S23 FE, S22📱Tablets🔹 Mid-April: Galaxy Tab S10 series 🔹 Late April: Tab S9 & Tab S8 pic.twitter.com/njPZeHwmBo<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904787401488080960">March 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>These dates could seriously matter for users in the U.S. since One UI 7's initial launch in the Czech Republic <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/one-ui-7-update-comes-to-galaxy-phones-on-april-10-in-us">lines up with ours</a>. Samsung announced the U.S. will see the OS launch three days <em>after </em>its global release on April 7. However, it seems the Czech Republic has received this same date, which could mean the U.S. will see similar dates for the OS upgrade for consumers with eligible devices.</p><p>In that announcement, Samsung didn't state the reason behind the small delay for those in the U.S. The good news is the company confirmed a date for us eagerly awaiting the update after the Galaxy S24 series picked up its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/the-galaxy-s24-ultras-new-one-ui-7-beta-is-crushing-bugs-before-its-april-debut">fifth One UI 7 beta</a>. The update cleaned up some glitchy lock screen notifications, small widget icons, and more.</p><p>However, Galaxy device owners should take this Czech Republic schedule with caution for the U.S. release, given <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">the strange confusion</a> with its blog post. The U.S. One UI 7 announcement post disappeared over the weekend before reappearing a day later. While speculation leans toward there having been a slight glitch on the website, others have noted Samsung's U.S. X account links to a "page not found" site.</p><p>We'll likely have to play things by ear (and eye) as we approach the extremely hopeful April 10 release date.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is due to release its next set of foldables sometime later this year at a summer Unpacked event, according to several rumors. While we don't have confirmation of the launch yet, several leaks seem to be dropping like hotcakes.</p><p>This time, the leak showcased alleged cases for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and the Galaxy Z Flip 7. Firstly, in a post on Weibo, avid tipster IceUniverse posted several images of the alleged Galaxy Z Flip 7 (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/samsung-phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-design-just-teased-in-new-cases-leak-and-the-outer-display-is-huge" target="_blank"> Tom's Guide</a>). These images show the device sporting different-colored cases from all angles.</p>

<p>The images show off the renders of the phone, cased in eight different colors, but what's more interesting is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-z-flip-7-shows-up-in-another-leak-with-starkly-familiar-camera-design">images back previous rumors </a>of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 — that it might indeed see a redesign and come with a larger 4-inch cover display.</p><p>It also appears to ditch the "folder-like" cover display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-review">Galaxy Z Flip 6</a>'s 3.6-inch display for a more end-to-end, seamless one — much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Motorola Razr 2024</a>. The renders also show us the rear cameras on the cover display that is expected to be a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens.</p><p>Additionally, IceUniverse posted four additional pictures on X that showcased real-life protective films and cases of the upcoming foldables. The Galaxy Z Flip 7 cases both black and clear seem to support the larger cover display it is said to come with, additionally, you see bumps for volume controls and the power button.</p>

<p>As for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">leaks indicate</a> that it could come with larger inner and outer displays, with a 6.5-inch cover screen and an 8.2-inch main screen. Samsung also gave us a major <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">hint at this year's MWC</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7"> </a>where it demoed a "nameless" foldable placed next to the Galaxy Z Fold 6.  This prototype showcased a display with nearly no fold crease whatsoever.</p><p>The images of cases from IceUniverse also seem to back the rumor of a large screen for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, and the case also looks slightly narrower according to the publication.</p><p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt, as we're still quite a few months from the potential launch of Samsung's next foldable phones.</p>

Others are coping and making excuses for the whole mess while posting responses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1iw7go6/samsung_blames_google_for_delay_in_one_ui_70/" target="_blank">from Samsung Customer Care, blaming Google</a> for the rollout issues.</p><p>The third group? They don't care as long as things still work right now and won't break when they're told to update their software. I think everyone is right and everyone is wrong, all at the same time.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-starts-to-roll-out-in-select-markets">originally promised</a> to deliver the One UI 7 update to eligible Galaxy S phones in Q1 2025, which isn't going to happen. It will get here eventually — the latest says it's coming in April — but that doesn't address the real problem: writing software is hard, and unless you have done it, you have no idea how hard it can be.</p><p>Of course, seeing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> released with the update makes it especially hard for consumers to swallow.</p><p>I'm saying the real problems with the rollout of One UI 7 are all about communication, transparency, and setting expectations. It has nothing to do with features or options or anything technical.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3733px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-One-UI-7-welcome" alt="One UI 7 welcome screen on the Galaxy Z Flip 6, sitting in front of colorful plants" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rx8GrebHaZcAUbk2bPTbGU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3733" height="2100" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You may think using software another company makes for you, like Android (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">from Google</a>) or Windows (from Microsoft), is easy, but it's not. It could be if every company used the exact same configuration of hardware specifically designated by the company that wrote it, but then you'd have a more Apple-like situation where you can't choose what product fits you best. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not for everyone.</p><p>Android is especially difficult because it's so ... "loose." However, as long as you follow some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it" target="_blank">rules from Google</a>, you can do a lot with it to make it look and act like something completely different — enter One UI 7.</p><p>Samsung executives and project managers have a vision of what each version of One UI will be. They decide how it will look, what features will be improved, which new features are needed, and what features will be removed. They base this on the feedback you give while using your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Samsung phone</a> via data collection. The next version of One UI will be a mix of things that Samsung knows users like to interact with.</p><p>This isn't done in a vacuum. Managers, engineers, marketing, and even carrier representatives are involved in the decisions that go into the update and its release schedule. One side wants everything, and they want it now, while others are more timid and want more time. A compromise is reached, and a timeline is built. Then, the chaos and "crunch time" begin.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm" name="Galaxy-Unpacked-Samsung-Google-partnership.jpeg" alt="Samsung and Google execs stand on stage together at Galaxy Unpacked." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yGgesVgwjpdeBv98iQNoHm.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The folks tasked with developing the ideas given to them from people up the chain need to find a way to do it all and try to do it by a given date. Samsung has historically been terrible at this, and I can't blame anyone at the company for it. Neither should you. It's a communication breakdown between the people making the promises and the people trying to fulfill them.</p><p>When you want to try and do too much, you need too much time. Integrating a new (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">though now a year old</a>) version of Android with a slew of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">AI parlor tricks</a> and a reinvented notification idea that will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-third-party-app-now-bar-support-report">include sports scores</a> and the kitchen sink is too much.</p><p>To top it all off, much of it will be discarded once a better way is introduced that's more integrated with Android. Split windows and one-handed mode come to mind. Samsung wants to be first, so it will race forward with an idea instead of waiting because that's a good way to sell more phones. If you are reading this on a Galaxy S phone, it probably worked on you.</p><p>None of this is a bad idea or anything you should be upset about. If you're upset, it's because you were told one thing and delivered a different thing. The overworked developers doing it aren't the people who told you what you would get and when you would get it. Welcome to marketing.</p>

<p>It will be here when it gets here. That's it; there is nothing more we need to know about it.</p><p>We <em><strong>want</strong></em> to know a lot more, though. We want to know a date and what to expect. We want to know that it won't have issues or be filled with bugs. We want it all, and we want it now. This goes for software updates from every company, not just Samsung.</p><p>I hate to break it to you, but it didn't get here when you wanted it, and once it does, there will be bugs. You may get angry and complain on the internet, and I can't blame you. Please complain about it the right way — Samsung needs to be more transparent and develop better communication with its customers before it tries to do anything else. The company has made great strides in software development over the past 10 years, and it's time to work on other things.</p>

<ul><li>Google reportedly "confirmed" to a publication that it will move to "privately" develop its Android OS and slow down its AOSP releases.</li><li>The main purpose of this is to "streamline" its process, as Google won't have to worry about "merging conflicts" with the AOSP as often.</li><li>Google is still expected to release its open source code on the AOSP as usual, but with a small change to its cadence.</li><li>Android 16 recently achieved Platform Stability ahead of its expected Q2 2025 launch.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A curious report on the future development plans of Android from Google has surfaced, detailing its potential impact.</p><p>A report by Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-android-development-aosp-3538503/">Android Authority</a>) supposedly "confirms" Google will shift to privately developing the Android OS as soon as "next week." The claim that Google's audible to a "private" focus only seems to facilitate a more "streamlined" approach to its OS development. According to Rahman, this more privatized way of developing Android will have a "minimal" impact for end-users who await these updates once completed.</p><p>Additionally, developers, both those who create custom ROMs and others who contribute to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/aosp">AOSP</a>, will also see little impact.</p><p>Rahman claims this change will more directly impact Google and the AOSP (Android Open-Source Project). The company will allegedly "change the frequency of public source code releases for specific Android components." Rahman states that, with Google's normal public source code releases for the AOSP, the company needs to "spend time and effort merging patches."</p><p>The "merging" part is key as Rahman states conflict often arises between the two branches and the involved code. To avoid getting too technical, Google is required to patch these issues between its internal branch and the AOSP through its normal public source releases. Making its development more private will slow things down to help this happen less often.</p>

<p>Rahman alleges nothing will change for developers looking forward to Android 16 as its open source code will see an expected release when it's ready. This makes sense as the entire purpose of the AOSP is for other developers to create their Android OS skins, like One UI from Samsung. However, since Google may take Android's software behind closed doors for longer (and more often), tipsters/leakers could find it harder to see what's coming.</p><p>Nothing has been directly confirmed yet from Google. The report alleges the company will make an official statement about this development change "later this week," so we'll see what happens.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">achieved an important milestone</a>: Platform Stability. Beta 3 rolled out for enrolled Pixels, bringing with it additional accessibility tools for low-vision users via Text Outline. The patch also includes "Local Network Protection," which lets users control what apps can access their device. Platform Stability is the last step before Android 16's grand rollout for users.</p><p>This step should consume the rest of March and April before the software drops in Q2 2025.</p>

<p>For years, Samsung has crafted some of the finest displays ever made by humankind. Ching Wan Tang and Steven Van Slyke might have created OLED technology at Eastman Kodak back in 1987, but it was Samsung who popularized its use in mobile devices with the launch of the original Samsung Galaxy line in 2010.</p><p>Over the years, however, Samsung has been slipping. Of course, you'd never know this by looking at smartphone display rankings on websites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dxomark.com/smartphones/#sort-display">like DXOMark</a>, where 9 out of the top 10 smartphone displays are all made by Samsung. Look a little deeper, though, and you'll start to understand the real problem: these displays are built to rank at the top of charts by using some nasty tricks that cause users <strong>real pain</strong>.</p><p>It's a similar "cheating" concept we saw years ago when smartphone manufacturers would specifically <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-cheat-android-benchmarks">tweak their phones' performance profiles</a> to push harder during a benchmark to achieve a top-rank score. The difference now is that it's not a company's pride on the line; it's our eyes.</p>

<p>HDR standards have been around for a long time and are commonplace on spec sheets. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/cmf-phone-1-review">Even $200 phones</a> support the HDR10 standard, but not all of them achieve 10-bit color naturally. Rather, many phone displays — including the $1,300 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> — only ship with a screen that can display 8-bit color.</p><p>As you might imagine, a pixel can't just magically jump from being able to display 256 shades of red, green, or blue up to 1024 shades unless it was built to do so. That's four times the number of each of the primary shades, which takes a significant engineering effort to create.</p><p>So, how does an 8-bit phone display achieve 10-bit color? By using something known as dithering, or more often known on displays as Frame Rate Control (FRC). You'll often see this on a spec sheet as "8bit + FRC" to represent the shift from 16.7 million colors — that's the total number of colors in an 8-bit palette — all the way up to 1.07 <strong>billion</strong> colors for 10-bit.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU" name="pixel-dithering-example" alt="An example of color dithering happening at the subpixel level on a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ChK2zpLgKyiqsp5DsAVNfU.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="281" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If you look closely at the above image I captured of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display through a microscope, you can see FRC dithering in action. An 8-bit panel, like the one on this Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra pictured above, will quickly flash between two different hues to "create" a color that doesn't exist. I captured this video at 480FPS with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which makes it possible to see the pixels flash more easily.</p><p>This phenomenon is possible thanks to the way our eyes work when they see a "moving" image. In video, pictures are often shown at 24 or 30 still images per second (frames per second), creating a smooth-looking movement. Likewise, color dithering flashes two colors to create a nonexistent color to our eyes, similar to spinning a color wheel.</p><p>For many people, this works to help create a sense of deeper or more vibrant colors. It's one of the ways Samsung ended up adding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-washed-out-display-is-intentional">a more vibrant color option</a> to the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, and it's present on the S25 Ultra this year.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Tricks like PWM dimming and FRC color dithering are used to top display quality charts by fooling eyes and calibration equipment into seeing something that doesn't exist.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>I spoke with Michael Hamilton, ISF calibration instructor at AVPro South, who helped explain why companies should try to use native 10-bit panels in premium products instead of resorting to 8-bit with FRC dithering.</p><p>"8-bit with Frame Rate Control does not do a very good job of preventing 'banding' and can still exhibit flicker or dithering (like in sky scenes where gradient transients are very subtle)," Hamilton explained.</p><p>"Additionally, when an 8-bit panel with FRC rapidly flashes, 'temporal' artifacts manifest such as a judder-like appearance to motion, or 'floating,' which areas of the image appear to be in motion [when they should not be] and directly adjacent areas are not, such as long-range shots of trees where some appear to be moving in a breeze while others are not, or an expansive water surface moves unnaturally and even the shoreline may appear to be moving.</p><p>Since they are not visible with a static image or patterns, a viewer may see ghosting or motion blur or otherwise motion glitches, and then, to confirm, they pause the video, and the anomaly subsides."</p><p>Hamilton works exclusively on TV calibration, where banding is more noticeable because of the size of the panel. Because of its size, it's unlikely you'll ever notice banding on a smartphone screen, but that hasn't stopped some Redditors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25Ultra/comments/1ihdwwx/banding_on_25_ultra_is_non_existent_in_irl_it/">from pointing it out</a>.</p>

<p>This methodology is clever from an engineering perspective, but it presents two problems. First off, Samsung is cheating you out of your money by using an 8-bit panel on a $1,300 phone. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a> uses a true 10-bit panel that doesn't need to dither to show all 1.07 billion colors for the HDR10 standard and provides the same seven-year software update commitment as Samsung.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 does the same thing for even less, even if it <em>only</em> gets six years of software updates. Despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-galaxy-s25-ultra-needs-to-fix-four-major-s24-ultra-display-problems">all the display problems</a> with the Galaxy S24 Ultra last year, Samsung is still using the same M13 AMOLED panel on the Galaxy S25 Ultra, just with a few software hacks to mask the problems it's having with display manufacturing quality.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Second, and maybe most egregiously, Samsung's use of color dithering causes some users real pain. This is a similar effect to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a>, another problem Samsung displays suffer from. Samsung uses low-Hz PWM dimming to save money and achieve a very specific display metric at different brightness intervals.</p><p>Hamilton also explained a few reasons companies use PWM dimming on TVs, although the same concept transfers over to phones:</p><p>"By rapidly flashing the backlight LEDs on and off, a less expensive power supply may be used. The byproduct of this is 'flicker,' which tends to vary depending on the picture mode. Some viewers detect this strobing and flashing, and with fast-moving objects, blurring or 'comet tailing' can be seen.</p><p>Uniformity issues tend to be exacerbated by fewer backlight zones due to cost reduction, and the image can look unevenly illuminated and unnatural in some scenes. These issues can be overcome: just 'bring money.'"</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>The end is the most illuminating aspect here. Samsung is putting profit margins ahead of the health of its users, particularly the ones most susceptible to the ill effects of display flicker.</p><p>The rest of the industry knows and understands the problems that color dithering and low-Hz PWM dimming can have on some users and has enacted positive change for everyone.</p><p>There's a reason companies like BOE and Visionox — which are found on phones from companies like Nothing, OnePlus, Honor, Motorola, and more — are making OLED panels with native 10-bit reproduction and support for both DC-dimming and significantly faster PWM dimming when needed.</p><p>The Honor Magic 7 Pro is capable of 4320Hz PWM dimming at low brightness while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra uses 480Hz dimming at all brightness levels. There's a clear spec difference here on multiple levels, and Samsung isn't winning any awards for having the best hardware. Just the best tricks to achieve a specific goal.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L all the way back in 2014, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Aside from pure profit margins, companies like Samsung Display choose to use PWM dimming and dithering on OLED screens because of how the tech works. Because OLED response time is in nanoseconds, unlike LCD, engineers have learned that dialing in the display calibration can achieve near-perfect scores on display quality tests. In other words, Samsung is designing its displays for measurement and calibration tools, not the humans who actually use them.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/dylan-raga/">Dylan Raga</a>, a display reviewer at XDA Developers, explained it very well. Speaking on the subject of calibration and color matching, he told me that "the best current strobeless solution would be for native 10bpc panels with multiple well-calibrated voltage states, using pixel-level dimming in-between them with active spatial DPU dithering."</p><p>In other words, Samsung is doing <em>exactly</em> what's needed to achieve the best scores on display tests, and therein lies the problem.</p><p>Raga went on to say that "a true 12-bit DAC would be ideal, but we’re not really near having those on consumer displays. Our only options that maintain reference picture quality involve using a higher base power for better signal control and modulating it down by some means."</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Many display companies have acknowledged the problems that color and light flickering can cause, but, as usual, Samsung, Google, and Apple seem oblivious.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>At this juncture, it seems we're presented with two main solutions to this problem: make displays more like BOE and Visionox or provide users with accessibility options that allow them to disable any "display quality" features that cause them physical harm.</p><p>These other OLED manufacturers have slowly improved their display quality over time while offering eye-friendly options like DC-dimming, which can lower display quality on OLEDs at some brightness levels but always reduce eye strain.</p><p>However, until companies like Google, Apple, and Samsung acknowledge the problem, we're stuck with phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and Galaxy S25 Ultra. Both of these phones top the charts for display quality because of the tricks they use to achieve these metrics. Thankfully, plenty of other companies have acknowledged these problems, but, as usual, it's the big three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">that refuse to accept the science</a>.</p><p>Google added colorblind modes to Android L <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-l-includes-new-display-modes-color-blind-users">all the way back in 2014</a>, and there's no reason the company can't add a way to disable color dithering or display flickering at the system level. Google has the power to set these accessibility options for users at the operating system level, but the company seems clueless about a problem that most of the industry has actively acknowledged. What's it going to take, Google? Samsung? Apple? The ball is in your court.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>You need an all-flash NAS with powerful internals, good thermals, and ultra-fast connectivity. <br><br><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You want the best software features.</p>
<p>The best part of the F8 SSD Plus is that it isn't anywhere as bulky as traditional NAS servers. As it doesn't need to house 3.5-inch drive slots, TerraMaster managed to create a design that's about the size of a router, but you still get eight M.2 slots with good passive and active cooling. You get thermal pads in the packaging to mount over any SSDs you install, and they do a good job ensuring the drives don't overheat. <br><br>There are no issues with connectivity either; the NAS has a 10GbE port at the back, and you get a solitary USB-C port alongside dual USB-A and an HDMI port. The NAS is powered by an 8-core Intel Core i3, and it has 16GB of RAM out of the box; clearly, this is overkill as a Plex server, and it does an outstanding job with 4K media and concurrent streams.<br><br>The only issue is that the software doesn't have the most polished set of features, but you can easily switch over to TrueNAS and install it if you wish to do so. Overall, the F8 SSD Plus is the best of the all-flash NAS models around, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F8-SSD-Plus-NAS/dp/B0D9HWLDX5">at $699</a>, it is a better value than its rivals.</p>

<p>I don't regret being late to the Wear OS party, missing years of buggy updates and terrible battery life. But my colleagues keep bringing up the gorgeous Moto 360 like it's the smartwatch holy grail. Now, I'm waiting impatiently for Motorola to follow in OnePlus and Xiaomi's footsteps and jump back on the Wear OS train.</p><p>I haven't spent that much time with Motorola phones, aside from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-review">Razr Plus (2023)</a> that I used to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/only-one-android-phone-could-tempt-my-partner-away-from-her-iphone">tempt my now-fiancee away from her iPhone</a>. I enjoyed the foldable gimmick, but it's hard to stay too invested without a compelling Motorola smartwatch to pair with one.</p><p>Since I joined Android Central, Motorola has stuck with cheap squircles like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/new-moto-watch-40-budget-fitness-tracker-announced">Moto Watch 40</a> and budget-minded circular models like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motowatch.com/moto-watch-120/">Watch 120</a>, with the generic health tracking, week+ battery life, and basic smarts you'd expect in the $70–140 price range.</p><p>I don't blame Motorola for leaving the old version of Android Wear behind. But 2025 should be a transformative year for Wear OS, and even if a new Moto 360 will provide a very <em>stock</em> Wear OS experience, I think it's important for the brand to offer a more complete device package if it wants to stay competitive.</p>

<h2 id="what-motorola-did-right-and-wrong-with-the-moto-360-2">What Motorola did right (and wrong) with the Moto 360</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:745px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6u5MD9XUqpi5dRwSzThxe4" name="Moto-360-side-view" alt="The Moto 360 smartwatch sitting on a desk, the angle emphasizing the rounded metal edge and side button." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6u5MD9XUqpi5dRwSzThxe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="745" height="419" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto 360 (2014) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Phil Nickinson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My Moto 360 perspective is entirely second-hand, as no one on staff has one anymore. But our original <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/moto-360-review-0">Moto 360 review</a> gushed about its traditional round look at a time when the LG G Watch and Samsung Gear Live were square; this watch and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/two-years-original-huawei-watch-still-one-best-android-wearables">original Huawei Watch</a> helped define "round" as the default <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watch</a> look.</p><p>It was far from perfect. It had a chin bezel for the ambient light sensor, a lower PPI than other watches at that time, battery life that required nightly charges — a full day wasn't a guarantee — and the limitations of early Wear software across brands.</p><p>The 2nd-gen Moto 360 (2015) added a crown, slimmed down the bezel (though it kept the sensor chin), improved the battery life, and stuck to the style and sensors that stood out among Wear watches.</p><p>Then Motorola bowed out of the smartwatch game, licensing out the Moto 360 (3rd Gen) to be made by a company called eBuyNow. It had a thick steel design (see below) that didn't quite stand out among Wear OS watches the way its predecessors did. It relied heavily on Google Fit software and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/moto-360-2019" target="_blank">reportedly</a> had poor battery life and connectivity issues.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HTnSu8TYhMBCgCZLndAuB" name="Motorola-Moto-360-2020-3rd-generation-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Moto 360 (3rd generation, 2020) Wear OS smartwatch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HTnSu8TYhMBCgCZLndAuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Moto 360 (3rd Gen) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I believe the biggest issues were outside of Motorola's control. It depended on Qualcomm's Snapdragon Wear hardware and Google's Android Wear software, both of which had significant and documented issues in that early era.</p><p>While I don't have any insider account on Motorola's Wear perspective, we know 2020 was around the time OnePlus's CEO said they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-ceo-says-hes-trying-work-google-improve-wear-os">tried to "work with Google to try to improve"</a> Wear OS for "better device interoperability" between phones and watches, but it gave up and used a proprietary OS for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-watch-review">first OnePlus Watch</a>.</p><p>You also have Xiaomi trying out Android Wear on the Mi Watch in 2019, then leaving it behind until its Watch 2 Pro in 2023.</p><p>The common thread is that Google's 2021 Wear OS partnership with Samsung — and much-improved <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> hardware — righted a sinking ship and brought OEMs back into the fold. But Motorola remains a missing link.</p>
<h2 id="motorola-is-too-big-to-depend-on-cheap-rtos-watches-2">Motorola is too big to depend on cheap RTOS watches</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Z6v4VkKxkNVaMthZVwR3FV" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-review-05.jpg" alt="The Android Bot next to the Motorola Razr Plus 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z6v4VkKxkNVaMthZVwR3FV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4005" height="2253" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Out of the Android OEMs that made Wear watches but haven't used Wear OS 3+ — ASUS, Huawei, LG (RIP), Motorola, OPPO, and ZTE — Motorola feels like the most natural fit with unfinished Wear OS business.</p><p>Parent company Lenovo owned a substantial 5% of the global 2024 smartphone market (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/worldwide-smartphone-market-2024">Canalys</a>), while Motorola, Honor, and Huawei were the "fastest-growing OEMs among all the top 10 brands" in 2024 (per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insight/post-insight-research-notes-blogs-smartphone-market-recovers-in-2024-after-two-years-of-decline/">Counterpoint</a>).</p><p>Assuming Motorola phones aren't <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-phones-could-be-banned-in-the-us-what-would-that-mean-for-the-market">banned next month</a>, they'll keep their substantial footprint. Foldables like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a> are catnip to Android power users, but I suspect they get most of their business from well-made budget phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a>.</p><p>Either way, these users are stuck choosing between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watches</a> with exclusive features that won't work on Motorola phones, fitness watches without proper messaging, or cheap Moto Watch models that still rely on Google Fit and the most basic health tracking. Only one, the Moto Watch 120, has Bluetooth calling with no LTE and only supports a passthrough version of Google Assistant from your phone.</p>
<h2 id="why-now-s-the-time-for-motorola-to-dive-back-into-wear-os-2">Why now's the time for Motorola to dive back into Wear OS</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1575px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jvaidPNTXeRmNVmZyFY4iQ" name="moto-watch-40-press-image.jpeg" alt="A render of the Moto Watch 40 in front of dozens of different possible watch faces." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jvaidPNTXeRmNVmZyFY4iQ.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1575" height="886" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Fewer Moto Watch squircles, more Moto 360-esque smarts, please! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Moto 360 watches were held back by the crappy hardware of their time. Now, picture one with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon chip likely coming this year</a>, enhanced with newer cores and AI capabilities, with battery life that consistently lasts a couple of days per charge.</p><p>Then pair it with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> — since Google and Samsung will probably keep <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 6</a> to themselves until 2026 — and give Motorola users access to proper wearable apps, with the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade">Gemini-on-Wear-OS update</a> arriving soon after.</p><p>And now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/googles-new-partnership-could-be-the-cure-for-wear-oss-health-data-headaches">Masimo is handling biosensing tech for Wear OS</a>, Motorola could dive right into the ecosystem with a higher standard of health tracking rather than having to play catch-up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB" name="Motorola-Adaptive-Display-MWC-wearing-05.jpg" alt="The Motorola Adaptive Display concept phone at MWC 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QmFCxFKoGPbvD6xfoqSZLB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Better a Motorola Wear OS watch than this thing </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Most OEMs wouldn't be interested, but Motorola still relies on Google Fit for its RTOS watches, even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-has-set-a-deadline-to-shut-down-the-google-fit-api">API shuts down this year</a>. I think if Motorola had the option to let Google handle the fitness software and could focus on wearable tricks, it would.</p><p>As it is, Motorola is spending a lot of R&D toying with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/motorola-adaptive-display-concept-best-for-sci-fi-not-real-life-use">wearable phones</a> like the ones above that are fun to try out but very impractical and not anything you'd call stylish. It's the exact opposite of the principle that defined the original Moto 360: stepping away from the squarish watches of the time and blending in with traditional accessories.</p><p>Instead of trying to reinvent the wheel, I'd be perfectly happy to see a budget Moto Wear OS watch. It could follow the template of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">OnePlus Watch 2R</a> and Galaxy Watch FE, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-smartwatch-android">cheap Android watches</a> that would appeal to the same group that buys $200–400 phones. In particular, the 2R has that multi-day battery life that practical Moto fans love.</p><p>Motorola, give us a stock Moto Wear OS watch with Google software that unleashes more smarts, health insights, and fitness tools to Motorola users — and evokes a classic round watch look. Until we get<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-fashion-problem-hybrids-are-the-answer"> more hybrid smartwatches</a>, we need this brand to come back and fill Fossil's niche, bringing a little more style and class to Wear OS.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Maps has been getting all kinds of fun abilities in the recent past— be it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-weather-related-road-hazards-report-options">ability to report weather-related disruptions</a> or Live Updates of your trip<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates"> via Android 16 Beta 2</a>,  Google is trying to make Maps more informative and user-friendly.</p><p>However, it falls short of providing all the information that the user needs at one glance. As of now, Google Maps on Android shows only three complications: traffic, distance to the destination, and time taken to travel. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-maps-more-details-in-route-overview/">Android Police tipster Moshe</a> spotted that Google Maps will soon be able to show you additional information on whether or not you'd have parking spots at the destination— indicated by the "P" icon, a fuel-efficient route, and also the exact time users would reach their destination.</p><p>All these details will show up within the first Google Map Overviews window, giving the users a better sense of what the situation at their destination looks like, and helping them plan their trips accordingly— as seen in the screenshots below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="taB8ZU3QNiWb2VVy7qSVcU" name="Google-Maps-Overviews-more-info" alt="New overviews page on Maps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/taB8ZU3QNiWb2VVy7qSVcU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Maps shows information on parking, fuel efficiency and also ETA  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Police)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As of now, to view fuel-efficient routes on Google Maps, users have to swipe up on the panel at the bottom to see route options, including those marked with a "leaf" icon for fuel efficiency. When a fuel-efficient route is available, Google Maps will display it alongside the fastest route, giving the option for users to pick between the two. It holds the same for information on parking and ETA (estimated time of arrival) as well.</p><p>While we aren't sure when this feature will roll out to people at large, the publication added that the tipster likely "got early access due to his high-tier Local Guide status on Google Maps." It seems like this feature is currently being tested on a small scale and will likely show up in the upcoming app updates.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="K8iG34nKWfg5mUiww8CZ4k" name="google-maps-navigation-1-hero-wide.jpg" alt="Google Maps navigation." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/K8iG34nKWfg5mUiww8CZ4k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Central has reached out to Google for a rollout timeline about the same and we will update this article once we have more information.</p><p>In other news, earlier this month <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/a-google-maps-bug-is-wiping-out-timeline-history-for-some-users">Google Maps users ran into an issue</a> where their entire Timeline history disappeared on the web version. Even though their Timeline is enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is showing a "No visits for this day," pop-up on their screens. This could have something to do with Google’s recent move to store location history directly on devices instead of in the cloud. This could also mean that Google is steering away from the web version and keeping fresh updates exclusive to the app.</p>

These earbuds are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09DT48V16">back down to $25 as part of Amazon's Big Spring Sale</a>, and that's a steal considering the sound quality they offer. Clearly, I'm not the only one who agrees that these are a terrific deal — the earbuds have racked up over 10,000 sales in the last month on Amazon alone, with a score of 4.4/5 from over 70,000 ratings on the platform.</p>

<p>There isn't much in the way of a distinctive design, but the X08 is available in eight color options, so you can pick up the buds in your favorite color. The case has an LED at the front that shows the charge level of the buds, and it is a nice addition. Battery life is pretty great, with the buds lasting just under six hours between charges. <br><br>They have a lightweight design and a comfortable fit that ensures there's no fatigue even with extended use. The IPX5 water resistance makes the X08 a good choice while running or working out, and there are zero issues with connectivity — I used the buds with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, and it maintained a rock-solid signal. <br><br>The sound quality is the real differentiator; the X08 just doesn't sound like most budget earbuds, delivering a vibrant and engaging sound with plenty of vigor. <br>Basically, these are the best-sounding budget earbuds I've ever used, and I tested over well over a hundred earbuds over the last half-decade.</p><p>There are gesture controls as well, but they tend to be a little finicky at times. Outside of that, I didn't see any problems with the X08. Their retail price in itself is a good deal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof/dp/B09DT48V16">but at $25</a>, there's just no reason not to get these earbuds.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a smartwatch with a wide range of health and sleep monitoring features; having a long battery life is important to you; you have other Google and Pixel devices and want a highly integrated ecosystem.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you want a hyper-accurate GPS watch; you need something super durable; you're looking for a watch with industry-leading OS updates.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a> is our top pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-for-wear-os">best Android smartwatch with Wear OS</a>, and there's more than one reason why. Perhaps most of all, we love the Pixel Watch 3's large 1.27-inch AMOLED display and the easy-to-use Wear OS. Whether you're a casual user or you're looking to watch your health more closely, this smartwatch has a broad range of health, sleep, and fitness monitoring features that buyers appreciate.</p><p>It's worth noting that while this watch does include GPS, it's definitely not as accurate as those with multi-band GPS, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 or one of Garmin's many GPS watches. Pixel Watches also come with one fewer Wear OS update than those of Samsung's Galaxy devices, which could be a deal-breaker for some buyers who want something as future-proof as possible.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/amazon-big-spring-sale-2025-best-deals-for-android"><em><strong>See our guide to the best deals for Android users during Amazon's Big Spring Sale</strong></em></a></p>

<ul><li>Google announced increased safety measures that will roll out soon to its Play Store.</li><li>In an attempt to create a safer Android Ecosystem, Google will expand Play Protect to “target malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</li><li>It will start adding more verified badges to help users identify and validate genuine apps — “Verified” for VPNs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/keeping-google-play-safe.html"> announced today </a>that it will be extensively working on making its Play Store a safer platform for both app developers as well as users. In a lengthy Android Developers' blog post, the company chalked out protection plans for 2025 that will make it easier for developers to build safe apps right from the get-go, which will help users recognize "real" apps from fraudulent ones.</p><p>To start, Google Play Protect, which has its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/new-real-time-protections-on-Android.html" target="_blank">live threat detection</a> in place, is  expanding its protection to target more "malicious applications that try to impersonate financial apps."</p><p>Recently, the Google Play Store was impacted by a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-mass-app-deletion-underway-confirmed"> massive ad fraud</a> that made users download "vapor apps" disguised as genuine popular apps. These ran recurring ads, making it difficult for users to delete and generating tons of revenue for fraudsters. After that, Google had to take down 180 apps from the platform.</p><p>Google started warning users when it detected an unsafe app that originated from sources outside of Google Play. The tech giant will also be expanding its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.googleblog.com/2024/02/piloting-new-ways-to-protect-Android-users-from%20financial-fraud.html" target="_blank">financial fraud protection pilot</a> to additional countries where it has seen "higher levels of malware-based financial fraud."</p><p>The blog further adds that the company's most recent analysis found over "50 times more Android malware" from sources outside the Play Store like internet browsers and messaging apps, likely from users clicking on scam texts or links.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7" name="Google-Play-Store-hero-AC.jpg" alt="Google Play Store homepage" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PwTCf9vyKJxtkDf6YBFTF7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"This year we’re working on ways to make it even harder for malicious actors to hide or trick users into harmful installs, which will not only protect your business from fraud but also help users download your apps with confidence," the blog stated.</p><p>Furthermore, the company is going to add a "verified badge" on specific VPN apps to help users discover more secure VPNs and will expand this to other app categories in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN" name="Google-Play-Protection" alt="Stats of developers using Play Integrity APIs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e8REYWW3YVxzJzLKLWVfKN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Developers Blog)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>App developers will also see tools to help protect their apps/businesses from fraud. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/google/play/integrity" target="_blank">Play Integrity API</a> tool, which helps keep fraud, bots, cheating, and data theft at bay, will see “stronger protection for even more users” that will help them "re-identify abusive and risky devices in a way that also preserves user privacy." Google is also working on self-help tools that allow users to solve issues "for when they're using a tampered version of the app." These features will be rolled out to developers as early as May.</p><p>Lastly, Google is leaning in on the importance of feedback from developers through new features in Console and Android Studio. The Google Play Developer Help Community will also include more languages, such as Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and Portuguese, catering to a wider audience.</p>

<ul><li>Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out publicly through a Google Play Store update now.</li><li>The update, which could take weeks to appear for everyone, doesn't seem to have any new features.</li><li>An APK teardown of the update hints at Gemini features coming to Android Auto screens soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android Auto 14.0 is beginning to roll out to users as an update in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play">Google Play Store</a>, as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/android-auto-14-0-update-gemini-preparation/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. Although the Android Auto 14.0 update does not appear to include any new features or behavior changes, there are a few signs included within that hint at Gemini soon replacing Google Assistant.</p><p>This shouldn't come as a huge shock, since Google revealed earlier this month that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Gemini would officially replace Assistant on most devices</a> by the end of 2025. There are already hints that Gemini could eventually reach Google TV, Android Auto, and Nest hardware. Now that Android Auto 14.0 is stable and rolling out, there are more code strings that preview how Gemini could take over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a> screens.</p><p>One prompt in particular, hidden in the Android Auto 14.0 APK, reads "Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car."</p><p>9to5Google also revealed the following code strings in Android Auto 14.0 that hint at future Gemini features, prompts, and survey questions:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers language-" language="" ><code><string name=”assistant_education_tooltip_gemini_upgrade”>Gemini is now the personal AI assistant in your car</string>
<string name=”assistant_summarization_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was the message summary content?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_gemini”>How satisfied were you with Gemini in Android Auto today?</string>
<string name=”csat_survey_question_voice_subjourney”>What was your primary goal for using voice interaction in Android Auto today? Select the task that had the biggest impact on your satisfaction.</string>
<string name=”gemini_quick_feedback_prompt”>How was your Gemini experience?</string></code></pre>
<p>Aside from the code strings, there are also various images for both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> and Gemini Live included in the Android Auto 14.0 update. However, these strings aren't live, so don't expect to use them after updating to the latest version of Android Auto. At the time of publishing, you can't use Gemini in Android Auto just yet.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd" name="Android-Auto-Mercedes-Waze-map.jpg" alt="Android Auto running split-screen with Waze in Mercedes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9CjKbkmiF9o3kcwsXYsbTd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, it appears that Google is gearing up to make the big switch from Assistant to Gemini on Android Auto soon. We've already seen that Gemini features can be manually enabled, and the latest image assets and code strings in Android Auto 14.0 are yet another sign that the transition could occur imminently.</p><p>It's unclear when exactly the Gemini experience will become available for Android Auto users.</p>

<ul><li>An APK teardown reveals that Google could be working on letting you upload up to ten images onto Gemini.</li><li>As of now, users can only upload one image and additional images get replaced with the one that has been uploaded onto the chatbot.</li><li>This feature showed up on the beta version of the Google app v16.11.32.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been making several improvements to Gemini's capabilities, bringing more features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-new-gemini-live-experience-with-saved-audio-recordings">Gems, Gemini Live and screen recording </a>to the free tier. However, the most basic ability to upload multiple images on to the AI chatbot seems to be missing—but this could change soon.</p><p>An<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-multi-image-upload-apk-teardown-3538149/"> APK teardown</a> performed by folks at Android Authority via Assemble Debug seems to have revealed a hidden feature that allows users to upload multiple images with a limit of 10 pictures at once.</p><p>Currently, users can upload only one image per prompt. If they try to upload more images, Gemini will ask if they'd like to replace the already uploaded file with a new one. This limits the user's need to give Gemini more information to get an all-around analysis of several images in one go.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JKQM9qqFLeyoVqeJXhaV5A" name="Gemini-multi-image-upload" alt="Gemini APK teardown shows multi-image feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JKQM9qqFLeyoVqeJXhaV5A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The publication added that, with the Google app <em><strong>v16.11.32 beta</strong></em>, they were able to activate the ability to upload multiple images for analysis in the Gemini app. They assume that this feature was already tested and made functional for users but has been hidden for the masses to be released through an update in the future.</p><p>Once this feature was enabled during the teardown, they were able to attach up to 10 images onto Gemini's app within a single prompt, and Gemini was able to analyze all the images in one go, describing what those images contained. This feature would significantly reduce the time it takes for users to upload one image in each prompt and then wait to upload the next for the chatbot to interpret, as seen in the screenshot above.</p><p>While we don't know if and when this feature will roll out to users on a larger scale. However, since it seems pretty functional, this rollout could happen in the near future.</p><p>Furthermore, Google has just released its most advanced AI model — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a>,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-5-pro-is-googles-latest-ai-model-with-thinking-and-multimodality-built-in"> </a>starting today to its Gemini Advanced subscribers. The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models, moving to enable complex problem-solving abilities and serve as context-aware AI agents</p>

<p>Trade in an old or broken device at Samsung and you'll get up to $500 off the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus, one of the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> ever made. Don't have anything to trade in? Skip that process altogether and you'll still be guaranteed to receive a $150 discount, the exact same price drop that you can find at Amazon right now. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/tablets/galaxy-tab-s10/buy/galaxy-tab-s10-plus-256gb-moonstone-gray-wi-fi-sm-x820nzaaxar/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="252a65a8-548f-43ae-80f1-b61a67f400c5" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Plus 256GB: $999.99">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus is all about balance, coming complete with a gorgeous 12.4-inch 120Hz display, powerful MediaTek Dimensity 9300+ with 12GB of RAM, and all of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> software features. The versatile device also comes with an S Pen stylus, 4K UHD video recording, and outstanding battery life that could rival any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">best Android tablets</a> in the biz. </p><p>Even if you skip the trade-in process, I&apos;d still recommend buying the tablet at Samsung so you can take advantage of those free subscriptions — it&apos;s over $150 of free stuff, none of which is currently being offered by Amazon. You can also pair the purchase of the tablet with the Galaxy Watch 7 to save 38% on the watch, or grab an accompanying keyboard book cover to get 50% off.</p><p>Needless to say, there are a ton of money-saving opportunities all over the web this week, but before you buy that Galaxy device from Amazon, take a look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/"><strong>Samsung&apos;s deal page</strong></a> to make sure you aren&apos;t missing anything special. </p>

The post states the update was initially rolling out for enrolled testers in South Korea, but the publication claims it's been spotted on "international variants," too. Interestingly, Beta 3 brings the April security patch to the foldables.</p><p>Marked as version ZYCG, the tipster states the update is roughly 1.2GB in size.</p><p>The publication provided a look at its changelog for English users, which shows "new features" for the foldables, like the ability to "press and hold the side button to launch the digital assistant." The devices gain call recording summaries (in text), webpage summaries, and natural-language search in Settings.</p><p>A couple of larger Galaxy AI features via One UI 7 include the ability to "edit video sounds" and custom image and sticker creation. As the post notes, these are referencing Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-use-audio-eraser-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Audio Eraser</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Sketch to Image</a> AI features. The patch finishes with a few bug fixes for widget errors, overlapping problems, and media card issues in One UI 7.</p>

<p>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai-sketch-to-image-multimodal-updates-teased">teased a few advancements</a> coming for its AI-based Sketch to Image in One UI 7 back in January. The company stated the changes were centered around making the feature more "multimodal." Its upgrades let users utilize their S Pens, as well as the option of text descriptions and voice commands. One of its goals was to make Sketch to Image more available to users who'd rather use other means to generate an image.</p><p>More importantly, users can combine a rough sketch with their text/voice descriptions to make a more complete idea for the AI to polish up for you. While not explicitly stated in the patch notes, it appears that these One UI 7 upgrades have fallen onto Samsung's latest foldables in Beta 3.</p>

<p>It might make some users happy, considering One UI 7's AI features <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">demand a lot from a phone</a>. An interview with Samsung's EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, highlighted that not every past-gen Galaxy device will see <em>every </em>AI feature. Some tools, like its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-personal-data-now-bar-highlighted-report">Personal Data Engine</a>, require stronger internal hardware, like Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. As such, many "deeper AI experiences" will be left out of the software's debut on older phones.</p><p>The Flip 6 and Fold 6 started receiving <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">the first beta</a> at the beginning of April. The initial download was roughly 5GB and packed many AI features and improvements that the Galaxy S24 first received in its Beta 1. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">was expected</a>, but we are still awaiting One UI 7's grand rollout for users without a Galaxy S25. One UI 7 is expected to arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-us-deletes-april-10-one-ui-7-announcement-post">officially on April 10</a> for the Galaxy S24, Galaxy Z Flip 6, and Fold 6.</p>

<hr>
<p>Nothing is pushing an update for its recent budget phone duo that introduces a new Essential feature and cleans up a few messes.</p><p>Kicking off the March 25 update for the Nothing Phone 3a Series is Essential Key compatibility with the Camera app. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/29173-nothing-os-31-update-for-3a-series">community post</a>, the company states this update for the new physical button concerns the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and its 3a Pro</a> sibling. The Nothing OS 3.1 update features a quick video of how this will work for users.</p><p>In short, opening the Nothing camera app and pressing the Essential Key will take a photo, but save it to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">Essential Space</a> area on your device. Users can then attach a written note to remind them of what the photo signifies.</p><p>Alternatively, long-pressing the key when in the camera app lets you add a voice memo.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda" name="nothing-phone-3a-pro-essential-key-camera-demo" alt="The Nothing camera app receives support for the Essential Key on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sAu6w484CGfXudommoGmda.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nothing)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 3a and the 3a Pro will also receive a series of camera improvements once more. The changelog states the update brings more "intuitive" camera zoom interactions. The update "enhances white balance" for the rear cameras, improves "clarity and tone" for portraits in backlit scenarios, and improves the responsiveness of the camera.</p><p>Additionally, Nothing states it's fixed a strange "reddish skin tone issue in front-facing camera selfies." The Phone 3a Pro gets one specific camera change, which improves the focusing accuracy when utilizing 2x focal length.</p><p>The remainder of the patch notes for the 3a and the 3a Pro is as follows:</p>
<ul><li>Optimised Essential Space experience and performance</li><li>Improved AOD (Always-On Display) transition animations</li><li>Various bug fixes and stability improvements.</li></ul>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-back-03" alt="Comparing the transparent backs of the grey Nothing Phone (3a) Pro with the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P8q6NDMBoxMRVbjBh6BUiU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update has started rolling out; however, Nothing urges patience with its users, stating the patch is "gradually" making its rounds. Users can manually check if they have the update by hopping into <strong>Settings > System > System Updates</strong>. What's more, the company detailed its upcoming plans for the Essential Space, including Smart Collections, Focused Search, and Flip to Record.</p><p>Technically, this is the second update for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">the 3a Pro</a>, as the first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-phone-3a-pro-gains-first-update-ahead-of-release">was a pre-launch OTA</a> that dropped right as the phones launched. There were a wealth of camera updates to improve its clarity in macro mode and performance for better photo quality. Moreover, Nothing's update helped its Essential Key and Space features, adding widgets and improving the button's interactions.</p><p>Aside from that, Nothing started emailing consumers in a few overseas areas <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-pro-pre-order-shipping-delay-email">about a shipment delay</a> for pre-ordered Phone 3a Pros. The email mostly concerned those in Europe, as the company states devices pre-ordered will now "ship before April 15."</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's latest AI model, Gemini 2.5, is rolling out starting today, March 25, with an experimental release of Gemini 2.5 Pro, it announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-model-thinking-updates-march-2025/#gemini-2-5-thinking">blog post</a>. Gemini 2.5 is Google's "most intelligent AI model" yet, per the company. The experimental version of Gemini 2.5 Pro backs up that claim, ranking first on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/?leaderboard" target="_blank">LMArena's leaderboard</a> — ahead of Grok 3, GPT-4.5, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek R1</a>.</p><p>Google has been ramping up its AI development, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">releasing the Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking model</a> last month. It can conduct multi-step reasoning and use certain techniques to reach a conclusion, all while the end user can trace its reasoning process in real time.</p><p>This time around, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 models</a> are thinking models, and are "capable of reasoning through their thoughts before responding, resulting in enhanced performance and improved accuracy."</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro sits atop many of the benchmarks and leaderboards for large language models (LLMs), and Google says it achieved this feat by "combining a significantly enhanced base model with improved post-training."</p>

The company says it is building thinking capabilities into all its Gemini 2.5 models moving forward so that they can solve complex problems and serve as context-aware AI agents.</p><p>Gemini 2.5 Pro also performs well in knowledge, science, and math benchmarks.

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly "planning" to introduce several third-party apps into the fold for One UI 7's Now Bar.</li><li>Many are still unknown; however, rumors state Kakao T, Naver Sports, YouTube, and YouTube Music could be on the way.</li><li>A rumor from mid-March claimed Samsung was looking into "forced" third-party support and more customization options for the Now Bar via Good Lock.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors are surfacing again about Samsung's apparent interest in expanding app support for a key One UI 7 feature.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.etnews.com/20250324000350?">ETNews</a> (Korean) claims Samsung is "planning" to introduce several third-party apps to users with Now Bar compatibility (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/25/samsung-now-bar-third-party-apps-report/#more-666321">9to5Google</a>). The Korean OEM is reportedly going to bring these additional apps to One UI 7's Now Bar with "cross-app actions." As the post notes, this is one of the key features of the newest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-galaxy-s23">Galaxy S25 series</a>, so it seems there's a chance Samsung wants to keep this consistent even with third-party additions.</p><p>Regarding what Samsung could bring, there's speculation from an alleged industry source that the Now Bar could add Kakao T and Naver Sports. The former is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kakaocorp.com/page/service/service/KakaoT?lang=en">transportation app</a> in South Korea responsible for taxis, driver bookings, and scooter sharing. The post states the addition of Naver Sports could be similar to the likes of Google Sports.</p><p>There is more to be expected; however, the report didn't express what those could be. However, it curiously highlights YouTube and YouTube Music, stating those apps are "not yet installed." It seems Samsung is moving to bring those into the Now Bar (which would be nice), but nothing's clear just yet.</p>

<p>Rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-now-bar-module-rumored">surfaced a week ago</a> about Samsung's alleged plans for the future of the Now Bar, which includes third-party apps. Though a small mention, a tipster claimed Samsung was moving along with an update that would bring "forced support for all third-party apps." Fortunately, this new South Korean report gives us a better idea of what <em>might </em>show up for the Now Bar if all goes well.</p><p>The core of that previous rumor was the new customization features the company is supposedly working on. Speculation states the Now Bar will receive a dedicated Good Lock module that'll let users change its color, size, and animations.</p><p>Meanwhile, that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-lock-screen-now-bar-update-rollout">Google Sports update</a> for the Now Bar dropped earlier this month. The patch essentially made it easier for users to see the scores they want and keep up with their favorite teams in a streamlined way. Users can browse through "Following" and "Recommended" sports/team tabs, as well as a full list of available organizations. That update for One UI 7 made it even easier for users to manage their notifications, too.</p>

<p>With the Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/every-android-flagship-should-steal-this-ai-feature-on-the-samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series </a>out of the way, we've been seeing some insane Galaxy S26 leaks coming in. The most recent one brings more input on the high-end Ultra model's cameras.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/wild-galaxy-s26-ultra-rumor-hints-at-insane-camera-upgrades/">SammyGuru</a> spotted a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SiddhantGeek/status/1904490741394473052"> post on X,</a> that revealed extensive specs of the cameras that the Samsung Galaxy S26 could come with. Siddhant B, claims that these specs were first put out by avid tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve" target="_blank">@Jukanlosreve,</a> known for leaking Samsung-related news.</p><p>The post by Siddhant claims that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with a variable aperture, on its primary wide 200MP lens. This means, that the user could change the aperture of the lens while taking a picture. The aperture could vary anywhere between f/1.4 and f/4.0. This would allow users to manually pick the desired f-stop based on the primary light they have while shooting pictures. In retrospect, the Galaxy S25 Ultra's wide lens comes with an unchangeable f/1.7 aperture setting.</p><p>Aperture is measured in f-stops, which determines how much light enters the lens providing better-quality images. For instance, a wider opening of the lens allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter image in low-light settings. While smaller lens opening allows for less light to enter the lens, which is ideal when shooting outdoors on a sunny day(aka, f/4.0 could be the aperture setting in this situation).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the X post states that while the Galaxy S26 Ultra will keep its predecessor's 200 MP wide lens, it will also be taking the 50MP ultra-wide camera along as well, which has a 1/2.52-inch sensor with 0.7µm pixels, 13mm focal length, and an f/1.9 fixed aperture.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims that the Korean OEM will be ditching Galaxy S25 Ultra's 10MP telephoto lens for a larger 50 MP lens with a 3.5x optical zoom, which has a 1/3.15inch sensor, 80mm focal length that will have a F/2.4 aperture. The other telephoto lens won't be left behind, since it will get an 8x zoom, an upgrade from the 5x optical zoom on its predecessor. This 50MP lens will have a 184mm focal length, and a  1/2.76-inch sensor, with an f/3.0 aperture.</p><p>As of now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi's 14 Ultra </a>showcases variable aperture, alongside <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-50-launch">Huawei's Mate 50 Pro</a> and if these rumors were even close to being true, then the Galaxy S26 Ultra could come with a much-needed camera upgrade that will allow users more control over clicking photos on the device. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s26-ultra-stagnant-hardware-changes-rumored">another rumor claims </a>that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will come with subtle hardware changes like thinner bezels, and could see charging capabilities between 45W to 50W. While additional leaks are expected to keep coming in throughout the year, here's what we expect to see from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">next Galaxy flagship series.</a></p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/do-airpods-max-work-android-phones">AirPods Max</a> might be the most controversial pair of headphones on the planet. At $549, they are ridiculously expensive and feature controversial design decisions — like a heavy aluminum construction and no power button. On March 24, Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2025/03/lossless-audio-and-ultra-low-latency-audio-come-to-airpods-max/" target="_blank">announced</a> that AirPods Max (USB-C) will gain support for lossless, wired audio and low-latency Bluetooth audio in an update next month.</p><p>But is that enough to move the needle for AirPods Max, an expensive and flawed pair of over-ear headphones?</p><p>Make no mistake: the AirPods Max should've supported wired audio from the very beginning. In fact, the older Lightning version of AirPods Max <em>did</em> support wired audio, albeit with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MXK22AM/A/lightning-to-35-mm-audio-cable-12m-white" target="_blank">$35 proprietary cable</a> that's no longer sold by Apple. However, when the company refreshed the headphones with a USB-C variant, that feature was seemingly dropped.</p><p>Now, Apple is bringing wired audio back to the AirPods Max, this time using the USB-C to USB-C cable that comes in the box. It's also selling a USB-C to 3.5mm cable for the new AirPods Max separately for other audio sources. At face value, this update — when it reaches AirPods Max (USB-C) owners in April — seems like a big upgrade. That is until you realize that almost all of Apple's competitors already supported wired audio on their over-ears.</p>

<p>Two of my favorite AirPods Max competitors for Android, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-ace-review">Sonos Ace</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/dyson-ontrac-review">Dyson OnTrac</a>, shipped with wired audio capabilities from day one. Sonos includes a USB-C to USB-C and a USB-C to 3.5mm cable in the box, while Dyson sells a USB-C to 3.5mm cable separately for $20. The same goes for other excellent over-ear headphones, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">Sony WH-1000XM5</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">Bose QuietComfort Ultra</a>.</p><p>Put simply, all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones">best wireless headphones</a> already support the feature Apple is just adding to the AirPods Max next month — it's not exactly groundbreaking.</p><p>Even Apple's own Beats headphones have worked with wired inputs for years. The current generation of Beats Studio Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-solo-4-review">Beats Solo 4</a> both support wired use, not only with a USB-C to USB-C cable but also with an inbuilt 3.5mm jack. That means the Studio Pro and Solo 4, both of which are Apple-made headphones costing a fraction of the price of AirPods Max, are actually more versatile.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK" name="beats-solo-4-usbc-aux-ports.jpg" alt="Beats Solo 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2GVxL8kxeA2fWn5PHetDjK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Beats Solo 4 cost under $200 and have two wired audio ports: USB-C and 3.5mm. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update heading to AirPods Max (USB-C) units in April was long overdue. Despite the headphones costing a fortune, they weren't truly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/this-tiny-dongle-brings-aptx-lossless-to-any-phone-and-its-fantastic">"lossless" or "high-fidelity"</a> due to their reliance on wireless connection. When AirPods Max get the ability to use a cable, they'll finally unlock 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio.</p><p>Aside from the sound quality boost, there are a few practical benefits to using a cable. For instance, most airlines still rely on the 3.5mm jack for inflight entertainment. Unless you want to be using the cheap, tinny earbuds flight attendants pass around instead of your $549 headphones, you'll want them to support wired audio.</p><p>That's why I'm glad Apple finally got onboard — every pair of over-ear headphones should have a wired audio option.</p>
<h2 id="airpods-max-still-aren-t-a-great-buy-2">AirPods Max still aren't a great buy</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j" name="Apple-AirPods-hero-240909_big.jpg.large_2x" alt="AirPods lineup, including the USB-C AirPods Max." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XgnvFNbWprf8irnWmbTi6j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1960" height="1102" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's the thing: AirPods Max are still an incomplete product, even with the latest set of upgrades. When Apple upgraded the AirPods Max, it added USB-C and new colors and not much else. To that end, the $130 AirPods 4 are using newer chips and audio technology than the $549 AirPods Max. The same goes for the $249 AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2.</p><p>With the incoming update, Apple is touting that AirPods Max (USB-C) will support ultra-low latency audio over a wireless connection with Apple devices. But as it turns out, AirPods Max won't support wireless lossless audio with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/apple-vision-pro-vs-meta-quest-3">Apple Vision Pro</a>. Of course, there aren't that many Vision Pro owners out there, but with that being said, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-pro-vs-airpods-pro-2">AirPods Pro 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-review">Powerbeats Pro 2</a> both support this feature thanks to their newer H2 chip.</p><p>It underscores that this feature drop for AirPods Max doesn't change the fact that they are lacking not only compared to competitors but also to Apple's own products. AirPods Max (USB-C) should've supported wired audio from the beginning. Even when it does, plenty of alternatives—like the QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and Sony WH-1000XM5—will still be a better option at roughly half the price.</p>

<hr>
<p>A new rumor claims that Qualcomm might scrap the "Elite" branding for its next chipset and go with Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead.</p><p>According to leaker Digital Chat Station on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pk8WP9umB" target="_blank">Weibo</a>, Qualcomm is gearing up to introduce the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 next month (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Not-Elite-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-4-leak-outs-launch-info-and-key-details-of-the-Snapdragon-8s-Gen-3-successor.986339.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). We’ve already got some early specs floating around thanks to recent leaks, giving us a sneak peek at what this chip is packing under the hood.</p><p>Keeping up with Qualcomm’s chip lineup isn’t easy, but the flagship series is a bit more straightforward. Qualcomm typically launches a top-tier SoC along with an “s” variant for budget-friendly flagships each year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> getting some pretty positive market feedback, all eyes are now on the upcoming sub-flagship chipset.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8s-elite-cores-power-leak">Contrary to earlier speculations</a>, DCS says Qualcomm is ditching the Snapdragon 8s Elite name in favor of Snapdragon 8s Gen 4.</p><p>The name change likely comes down to architecture. Unlike the Snapdragon 8 Elite with Qualcomm’s custom Oryon cores, the the 8s Gen 4 is sticking with off-the-shelf ARM designs.</p>
<h2 id="power-and-efficiency-mix-2">Power and efficiency mix</h2>
<p>According to DCS, the chip, designed as SN8735, will pack a 3.21GHz Cortex-X4 Prime Core, backed by three 3.01GHz Cortex-A720 cores and two 2.80GHz Cortex-A720 cores for heavy lifting. For better efficiency, it's expected to also include two 2.02GHz Cortex-A720 cores.</p><p>On the graphics front, the new chip is expected to rock an Adreno 825 GPU. They're from the same next-gen family, but leaks suggest Qualcomm might be trimming down the core size a bit. This means you'll still get great mobile gaming performance; just don't expect it to quite match the absolute top-tier 8 Elite's graphical muscle.</p><p>In a separate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/Pka9pm13K" target="_blank">Weibo post</a>, the leaker says the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 will use the same ISP as the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Plus, at least four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> are already in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm/the-first-snapdragon-8s-elite-phones-could-launch-next-month-leaker-claims">the works with this chip</a>, including the Redmi Turbo 4 Pro, iQOO Z10 Turbo Pro, Xiaomi Civi 5 Pro, and Oppo K13 Pro.</p><p>Reports suggest Qualcomm will launch the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 in April.</p>

<p>Samsung is reportedly working on another XR gear that will launch alongside its XR headset via Project Moohan. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20250321000270">ETNews</a>, the Korean OEM is working on launching its first pair of XR smart glasses dubbed Project "HAEAN" which loosely translates to the sea coast or seashore according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-could-soon-be-able-to-explain-its-translations-better">Google Translate</a>.</p><p>According to the publication, the company is working on finalizing what these glasses will set out to do. Much like the XR headset, it could be powered by Galaxy AI, and will be much smaller than the head-mounted XR gear.</p><p>"They display information or images on the glasses like the lenses of glasses and transmit sound from the frame," the publication added.</p><p>These glasses will likely be pitted against <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">Meta's RayBan </a>smart glasses, which can be worn outdoors and interact with the surroundings, possibly with the help of AI. Previous<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-smart-glasses-unpacked-2025-glimpse-tipped"> leaks</a> indicated that they could weigh around 50 grams, have multiple cameras, and be coupled with the ability to make payments and respond to gestures and facial recognition.</p><p>It is also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-android-xr-smart-glasses-haean-3537694/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJO3yZleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHcTasEBO75KHlBx9GeyYRLuDyhb1cFulna83N_CnGHnirRlseB3swMJWKw_aem_lLsEiYPhvF8INj5anR-i8g">claimed</a> that these glasses could carry a Qualcomm chipset, and an NXP chip will be used as the auxiliary processing unit.

<p>ETnews adds that Samsung is making sure that these glasses are comfortable to wear and is "putting a lot of effort into a design tailored to the human body."</p><p>Last year, Samsung even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses-trademark-approval-spotted">trademarked</a> its smart glasses at the Intellectual Property Office in the U.K. It was filed under the “Virtual reality headsets; Augmented reality headsets; Headphones; Smartphones; Smart glasses” categories.</p><p>An industry insider to ETnews, “With Apple’s Vision Pro already on the market, Samsung’s focus will be on providing a more advanced user experience.” While we don't know when these XR glasses could see the light of day, the publication very confidently says that it will be launched alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">XR headset </a>which is expected to launch later this year, after Samsung showed it off more vividly at the MWC 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>OnePlus has a new accessory for its users to charge their phones effortlessly and that too in a smaller form factor.</p><p>Dubbed OnePlus Slim Magnetic Power Bank, it will be available for purchase through the OnePlus website for the U.S. market for $70. As the name suggests, the latest power bank is quite slimmer measuring 0.88cm in height at its thinnest. It further measures 9.6cm in length and 6.9cm in width.</p>

<p>On the whole, it will weigh around 120 grams. It is believed to be done by using high energy density battery cells, next to N52M magnets, and “a body composed of aluminum alloy to reduce overall thickness and weight,” OnePlus shares in an accompanying press release.</p><p>Additionally, the OnePlus Slim power bank packs in a decent 5000mAh battery capacity that provides USB Type-C charging next to supporting wireless charging, which claims to charge two iPhones at a time — since it is MagSafe compatible. There aren’t faster wireless charging speeds as they are limited to 7.5W for iPhones and 10W for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. Even in the wired charging case, the power bank is limited to 10W wired charging.</p>

<p>Other perks of the power bank comprise NTC intelligent temperature control, which promises to ensure that the battery does not overheat when charging. It is a four-bar LED power status indicator to give you an idea of the juice left in the power bank.</p><p>To ensure safer travel, OnePlus Slim is in compliance with international air transport regulations, meaning it can be easily carried in planes and bullet trains to keep your devices charged at all times.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo stated at the end of last year that it would debut a mixed reality headset, and at the Boao Forum for Asia, the Chinese manufacturer showcased the design of the Vision. The design looks to be a sleeker version of the Apple Vision Pro, but at this point, there's no mention of what the headset weighs, and the materials used in its construction. <br><br>Vivo says it will debut the prototype in mid-2025, and other than that, it didn't divulge much in the way of information around the headset. The MR headset is a part of Vivo's strategy to "strengthen its real-time spatial computing capabilities for future applications in consumer robotics," and coinciding with the design showcase, Vivo is announcing the establishment of a new robotics laboratory in China.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2666px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.04%;"><img id="qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n" name="Vivo Vision Discovery Edition" alt="Vivo Vision design reveal" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEMDHu27ACujqUyCdvSM8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2666" height="4000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Vivo will leverage the lab to build the "brain" and "eyes" of robots, utilizing its skillset when it comes to "AI large learning models and imaging." Vivo clearly is no stranger to doing a great job with imaging, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> is currently the best camera phone to beat. So it will be interesting to see how the brand can translate these proficiencies to robotics. <br><br>Switching back to phones, Vivo has announced that it will unveil the X200 Ultra in the month of April. The manufacturer teased the camera modules last week, and earlier leaks gave us a better understanding of what the device will be able to deliver in this area, and having tested the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> as well as the X200 Pro, I can't wait to get my hands on the X200 Ultra and see how Vivo manages to outshine the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> from last year. <br><br>However, it is likely the X200 Ultra may not debut outside China — much like its predecessor. We should know more about the device in the coming weeks, along with details on the Vivo Vision.</p>

<p>Motorola’s next-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable flagship</a> is already making moves, popping up in certification filings ahead of launch, and a new regulatory listing hints at some serious hardware upgrades inside.</p><p>A new listing on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://zd.taf.org.cn/#/equipmentDetail?code=34JfIVH%2BvTrlMf8jYpLKnS3dxml4OPYSqQZKXiv6M0hgV5NTK9C621FDd6Y0%2F9AtLR7k9WyZIlDX3aQ4d%2BWDSw%3D%3D" target="_blank">TENAA</a>, China's telecommunications certification authority, sheds light on a new device called the Motorola Razr 60 Ultra, which is expected to be the global name for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr Plus 2025</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_razr_60_ultra_appears_on_tenaa_with_huge_battery_increase-news-67071.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>).</p><p>According to the listing shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/ZionsAnvin/status/1903651511759986956" target="_blank">Anvin on X</a>, the Razr Plus 2025 packs a dual-cell battery with rated capacities of 1,090mAh and 3,185mAh, totaling at least 4,275mAh.

<p>The next-gen Razr Plus may keep the 2024 model’s design, but Motorola is clearly making some big moves under the hood.</p>

<p>The new battery marks a big jump from the previous model’s 4,000mAh. Plus, Anvin reports 68W fast charging, a notable upgrade from the current 45W on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Razr Plus 2024</a>.</p><p>Beyond the bigger battery, the Razr Plus 2025 is set to keep the same 6.9-inch inner foldable screen and 4-inch pOLED cover display. It’s also expected to pack dual 50MP rear cameras, a 50MP selfie snapper, and a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, with up to 18GB of RAM and 2TB of storage.</p>
<h2 id="standard-razr-shrinks-and-switches-the-processor-2">Standard Razr shrinks and switches the processor</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the regular Motorola Razr 2025 is rumored to pack the new MediaTek Dimensity 7400X chip and 12GB of RAM. In a surprising twist, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/" target="_blank">XpertPick </a>suggests it’ll shrink to a 6.7-inch display, down from the 6.9-inch screens used in previous models, including the 2024 Razr.</p><p>The regular model could also arrive in three colors: Pantone Gibraltar (blue), Pantone Lightest Sky (silver), and Spring Bud (green).</p><p>Motorola usually launches its Razr foldables in China first before going global, so chances are the company will stick to the same game plan this time.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-92">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>An OPPO-branded phone (PKX110) just cleared 3C certification, likely the OnePlus 13T or 13 Mini.</li><li>The listing reveals an 80W charging speed, but everything else is still a guessing game.</li><li>The phone is expected to rock the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and a 6000mAh battery, just like the OnePlus 13.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh leak has shed light on the key specs and features of OnePlus’ upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact flagship</a>, the OnePlus 13T.</p><p>A mysterious OPPO-branded device, labeled PKX110, just passed 3C certification in China (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/03/23/oneplus-13t-3c-certified-snapdragon-8-elite-compact-phone-spotted-with-80w-charger/" target="_blank">Gizmochina</a>). While the certification doesn’t reveal its official name, reliable leaker Digital Chat Station speculates it could be the OnePlus 13T or possibly the OnePlus 13 Mini (as others like to call it), based on clues shared on Weibo.</p><p>The only thing the certification disclosed is the device’s 80W fast charging, while everything else is still under wraps.</p><p>Even though the listing doesn’t reveal much, earlier leaks and rumors suggest the device could sport a 6.3-inch 1.5K flat OLED display. Now, whether that counts as "compact" in 2025 remains debatable. Some may call it pocket-friendly; others may say it's just average-sized.</p><p>Previous leaks also suggest the OnePlus 13T will pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, along with a 6000mAh battery, matching the larger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 13T is rumored to feature a 50MP main sensor and a 50MP telephoto lens with 2x optical zoom. Details on the front camera are still under wraps. As for the rear camera setup, it’s not confirmed whether it’ll be vertical or horizontal, but leaks suggest a vertical layout.</p>
<h2 id="the-return-of-oneplus-t-series-2">The return of OnePlus' T-series</h2>
<p>The upcoming phone marks the revival of the brand's T-series, the first since the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022. Pricing is still a mystery, but with the OnePlus 13 starting at $899 and the 13R at $600, expect the 13T to land somewhere in that ballpark.</p><p>Leaks suggest the OnePlus 13T will stick with an optical fingerprint sensor, keeping in line with previous OnePlus flagships instead of switching to the ultrasonic tech used in the OnePlus 13.</p><p>The exact launch date is still up in the air, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-compact-flagship-phone-may-finally-have-a-launch-date">reports point to a China release in May</a> or late April.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have rear mesh openings that, if blocked, can "greatly affect" sound quality.</li><li>You can clean the Pixel Buds Pro 2's rear mesh by using a few household items.</li><li>The company warns against using things like Q-tips or liquid chemicals, which can make matters worse.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Truly-wireless earbuds are notoriously difficult to clean, and Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 are no exception. This month, Google published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/thread/330665949/mesh-cleaning-tips-for-pixel-buds-pro-2" target="_blank">support document</a> detailing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-clean-your-headphones-earbuds">how to clean the Pixel Buds Pro 2 safely</a> to improve sound quality (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/pixel-buds-pro-2-clean-mesh/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Specifically, the guide explains how to clean the rear vent mesh on the earbuds, which can help resolve "audio issues or unwanted noise."</p><p>When the earbuds are placed in your ear, the rear vent mesh is located at the top of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a>. The mesh can be blocked by things like earwax or dust over time, and so can the small opening on each earbud. Debris blocking Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh or openings "can greatly affect the audio quality," per the company.</p>

<p>Luckily, it's easy to clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a few household items. You'll need an extra soft toothbrush, a paper towel, tap water, and Micellar water. The latter, Micellar water, is a type of water infused with small particles that can soak up debris like dust, dirt, or earwax. You can find it online or at grocery stores.</p><p>The following are Google's step-by-step instructions for cleaning Pixel Buds Pro 2 mesh:</p>
<ol start="1"><li>Pour regular water in a cup and micellar water into another.</li><li>Dip the toothbrush in micellar water and swish around so that the bristles are saturated. Hold your earbud in one hand and brush the mesh in deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Blot the earbud on a paper towel to dry the earbud mesh. Repeat steps 2 and 3 twice.</li><li>Rinse your toothbrush by dipping it in micellar water and then dip it in regular water. Swirl your toothbrush in the water to make sure the bristles are clean from earwax.</li><li>Brush the mesh one last time with deep circular motions for 15 seconds.</li><li>Give your Pixel Buds Pro 2 at least  2 hours to air dry and make sure they’re completely dry before use. You can blot the earbud on a paper towel to gently, yet thoroughly, get rid of any residual water.</li></ol>
<hr>
<p>Additionally, Google notes some things you shouldn't do when trying to clean your Pixel Buds Pro 2. That includes using Q-tips, which the company says could push dust, dirt, or earwax deeper into the earbuds' mesh. Additionally, the support page warns against using detergents, sprays, and alcohol, since they can break Pixel Buds Pro 2 components. Finally, you shouldn't clean Pixel Buds Pro 2 while charging them.</p><p>While this new guide covers the rear mesh specifically, Google has a complete Pixel Buds cleaning guide available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelbuds/answer/9112670" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support is beginning to roll out.</li><li>At least one user has gained access to the advanced features, which were showcased as part of Project Astra.</li><li>Google confirmed the live video and screen sharing features are rolling out for Gemini Advanced subscribers now.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Gemini Live's real-time video and screen sharing support is rolling out now for Gemini Advanced subscribers. The move is a long time coming for Google, which previewed this functionality as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">Project Astra</a> as far back as Google I/O 2024. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1jh42op/you_can_now_share_your_screen_mobile_to_gemini/" target="_blank">user on Reddit</a> first spotted the features' availability on a Xiaomi device, and Google later confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634480/google-gemini-live-video-screen-sharing-astra-features-rolling-out" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that they are beginning to roll out.</p><p>At <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, Google showcased the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a> features and revealed that they would <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">become available in late March</a>. Now, the ability to share live video and your phone screen in real-time is slowly rolling out, so the company is hitting its target. With this functionality, you can show Gemini Live what's around you — or what you're seeing on your phone — and ask questions about it with natural conversation.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard/comments/1ji04ja/a_short_demo_of_project_astra_share_screen_with">A short demo of Project Astra (Share screen with Live)</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bard">r/Bard</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Currently, if you activate Gemini, you may see an <strong>Ask about screen</strong> option. When the new Gemini Live capabilities fully roll out, you'll also see a <strong>Share screen with Live</strong> option if you're a Google One AI Premium subscriber. The former only takes a screenshot to share with Gemini, while the latter starts a real-time screen share that continues as your conversation with Gemini Live progresses.</p><p>Users will need to pay for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium</a>, which costs $20 per month, for access to Gemini Live with video streaming capabilities. With that being said, new Pixel phone purchases come with free trials of varying lengths, so Pixel 9 series owners may get the Gemini Live's video and screen sharing support for free.</p><p>While the new Gemini Live functionality is expected to come to various Android devices, Google specifically noted that newer devices would gain access first (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/22/gemini-live-astra-rollout-start/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). Alongside the Samsung Galaxy S25 launch, Google said Pixel phones and the Galaxy S25 lineup would be “among the first to get Project Astra capabilities like screen sharing and live video streaming.”</p>

<hr>
<p>The new Motorola Razr 2025 series seems to be showing up on<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href=""> multiple leaks lately</a>, considering it could be released sometime in June this year, much like its predecessors. In the most recent leak, the alleged we get to see the first look of the alleged Motorola Razr 2025, also referred to as the "Motorola Razr 60" from all angles, a new colorway, with major specs also tipped off (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/motorola-razr-2025-display-battery-colors-leak/">via 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The most recent leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/motorola-razr-60-specifications-colour-options-design/">Xpertpick</a>, which showed off renders of the alleged phone from all angles, including a new colorway that hasn't been a part of any recent leaks. The new color, dubbed "Spring Bug," showcases the device in a vibrant green hue, along with the other rumored colorways, such as dark blue and light grey colors dubbed “Gibraltar Sea" and  “Lightest Sky,” respectively.</p><p>Xpertpick further notes that their exclusive report is in collaboration with a "trusted source" that states that the Motorola Razr 2025 will see a smaller display of 6.7 inches when compared to 6.9 inches on the 2024 model. It will also support "wet touch functionality," enabling the user to use the screen even with wet hands.</p>

<p>At its core, the phone will reportedly be powered by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-dimensity-7400-7400x-ultra-efficient-gaming-ai-chips">MediaTek Dimensity 7400X</a> chipset and will arrive with 12GB RAM (up from 8GB in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>) and internal storage of 512GB (up from 128GB). Other than that, the device is rumored to get a battery boost of 4,500mAh battery with support for 30W Turbocharging.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, the device is said to get a 50MP ultra-pixel primary sensor, an ultrawide+macro lens (unknown pixel count), and a 32 MP selfie camera.  The phone is rumored to keep its 3.6-inch cover display and run on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> out of the box with Hello UX on top and the company’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/motorola-moto-ai">Moto AI</a> suite included.</p><p>In<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-plus-2025-wooden-finish-video-leaked"> other news,</a> the Motorola Razr Plus 2025 also showed up in a leak last week, showcasing a wooden finish. The device is said to stick to a 6.9-inch pOLED foldable display and a 4-inch cover screen. Other rumors claim the OEM will give the Razr Plus 2025 a 68W wired charging support.</p><p>That said, these are still leaks and should be taken with a grain of salt, while we wait to see what the actual device holds, here's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025#section-motorola-razr-plus-2025-price-availability">what we think will show up</a> on this year's Motorola Razr series.</p>

<p>The year 2025 is off to a fantastic start as far as budget and mid-range smartphones go. We've already got a pretty eclectic range of options to choose from, our current favorite being the Nothing Phone 3a. As a successor to the highly popular Phone 2a, the 3a offers a useful third telephoto camera, slightly quicker charging, and a brighter OLED display. It's not easily available everywhere, like in the U.S., which is where the Moto G Power 2025 comes in.</p><p>Motorola's offering is cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a</a>, more readily available in the U.S., and has stronger waterproofing. It's also a solid and dependable phone with equally lean software, a decently long update commitment for its price, and you get wireless charging. Deciding between the Nothing Phone 3a vs. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025</a> can get tricky, but that's where we come in.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr" name="nothing-phone-3a-back-01" alt="The transparent back of the white Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXRHuUBssdJd2SwshEXHr.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a follows the company's signature look of a transparent glass back panel with neatly laid out components. The side frame is plastic but it's matte so there's good enough grip when you hold it and it doesn't look cheap. We have the programmable Glyph lights too around the camera module which are a fun addition. The phone is slim but a bit weighty at 201 grams. Nothing has given it an IP64 rating for dust and splash resistance. While this is better than the 2a, it's not great for a mid-range phone in 2025. The 3a comes in white, black, and blue, but the latter is limited to select markets.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a's display is nicely specced with a large 6.77-inch AMOLED display and 120Hz refresh rate. It's a Full-HD resolution only but the pixel count is well above 300 ppi, so images and text look sharp. Nothing has chosen Panda Glass for scratch protection, which held up well when we tested it. Brightness levels are also pretty great with up to 1,300 nits when using it outdoors and up to 3,000 nits of peak brightness.</p>

<p>The Moto G Power 2025 has slightly taller dimensions but similar thickness and weight as the Phone 3a. The design is now similar to Motorola's more premium phones, which gives the G Power better street cred. We also liked the tough build quality of the phone which earns it a MIL-STD-810H rating. The back panel is made of faux-leather instead of glass but it still looks and feels quite premium. The lack of glass also means there's no worry of any shattering if you drop it. The G Power 2025 comes in a striking Leaf Green colorway and also Slate Gray.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 doesn't have a very captivating display as the Nothing Phone 3a, but it gets the job done. It's a 6.8-inch IPS panel with a similar resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and Gorilla Glass 5 scratch protection. The display worked fine in all lighting conditions during our review period, and we didn't face any issues.</p><p>The one design feature that really makes this phone stand out if the IP68/ IP69 rating. IP69 is something that's not available even on most flagship phones, so to see this on a $300 phone is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The Nothing Phone 3a is only available in the U.S. via the beta program, which means you need to jump through a few hoops in order to get it. As of writing this, Nothing's website says the 3a is sold out and new stocks are only expected in two months. Only the top-end variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is listed for $379. Nothing does sell a base variant too with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage in other markets for less. Apart from availability, there are compatibility issues right now with AT&T and Verizon's networks, but T-Mobile works just fine.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a> processor, which is a budget SoC optimized to improve AI performance. Sadly, gaming performance is actually worse than its predecessor, which is a step down. We noticed lower FPS in games like Minecraft on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">Phone 3a vs. the 2a</a>.</p><p>Thankfully, battery life is very good for a phone of its class. The 5,000mAh capacity will easily carry you through more than a day before you'll need to charge it. The 50W wired charging also ensures the battery is charged quickly, although you'll need to buy the charger separately. Wireless charging is a bit of a miss, something that the Moto offers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4027px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD" name="Moto-G-Power-2025-review-11" alt="Honkai Star Rail on the Moto G Power 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jQHoQi76jvswKMGjfKBzpD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4027" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Moto G Power 2025 delivers equally good battery life with the same capacity as the 3a. Charging speed is slower at 30W and you'll need to buy the adapter separately. There is 15W wireless charging, which is pretty good for a phone of its class.</p><p>The G Power 2025 only comes in a single variant with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage for $299. This makes it more affordable than the Phone 3a. Being a Motorola, you'll also easily find it online or at offline stores in the U.S. and it's compatible with all the major carriers. What's not so great though is the performance. Somehow, Motorola picked a worse SoC than the 2024 model for the new G Power and that shows even in everyday use. Even with 8GB of RAM and a clean UI, we noticed intermittent lag and sluggishness when using it. It's certainly not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-gamers">best phone gaming</a> and performs worse than the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>With the Nothing Phone 3a, you get three OS upgrades and six years of security patches. The phone ships with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and includes all the latest AI features like<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been"> Essential Space</a>. This feature is still in beta but the dedicated button makes it very easy to fire up some of the apps like voice memo or note-taking, when needed. More smart features like Smart Search, Smart Collections, and Focus Search are expected to come in a future update. The interface is clean and bloat-free, which is something we really like about Nothing's software approach.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2025 has a similar near-stock Android-like experience. You get Android 15 out of the box but only two major OS upgrades after that. Motorola hasn't had the best track record of issuing timely updates either so we'll take this promise with a bit of salt for now. As we mentioned above, the interface does get sluggish at times even if you're not doing anything taxing. There aren't many AI features either as that isn't really the focus of this phone.</p>

<p>Nothing debuts a telephoto camera on its phones for the first time in the Phone 3a (and 3a Pro). The 3a boasts an impressive 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom and 30x digital zoom. There's also a 50MP main camera and an 8MP ultrawide. In our testing, we came away impressed with the image quality from all the cameras, which is a big improvement over the Phone 2a. The phone can also do 4K 30fps videos, which is pretty respectable.</p><p>The cameras on the Moto G Power 2025 are serviceable under good lighting, but that's about it. You only get a 50MP wide and an 8MP ultra-wide sensor on the back, both of which deliver okay image quality. The same goes for the 16MP selfie camera, which is no match for the 32MP sensor in the Phone 3a.</p>

<p>If you live in a region outside the U.S. where the Nothing Phone 3a is easily available, you should 100% buy it over the Moto G Power 2025. It might cost a bit more, but you'll be getting a vastly better-looking phone as well as excellent cameras, good performance, slick software with a longer update cycle, and quicker charging. Apart from the weaker waterproofing and no wireless charging, there's no major con going against it. The Nothing Phone 3a Pro is also worth considering if you need better telephoto and selfie cameras.</p><p>For those living in the U.S., the Moto G Power 2025 is still a good buy at $300. If your priority is battery life and a phone that can survive a dishwasher, there's nothing better in this segment. You should be able to find the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a> for around $329 online as an alternative to the Moto. The Pixel gets you much better cameras, an OLED screen, an IP67 rating, and software updates till early 2028.</p>

<p>The iPhone vs. Android debate is as old as time but sometimes, the decision is not that simple. In the case of the iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R, those coming from an older number series iPhone might hesitate to get a new iPhone with just one camera and an older design. That's where the OnePlus 13R poses a real threat as it's a pretty compelling alternative to the 16e at the same price.</p><p>The biggest strength of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16e-review">iPhone 16e</a> is that it uses (nearly) the same chipset as the latest 16 series and it supports Apple Intelligence. It's compact, has great battery life, and supports wireless charging (although, no MagSafe). The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">best cheap phones</a> to buy. It has proper flagship specs that give the 16e a run for its money, on paper. But it's not the easiest to get a hold of in all countries and not everyone wants to carry around a massive slab of metal and glass in their pockets.</p><p>Putting aside the whole iOS vs. Android preference for a second, let's see if the 16e makes a strong enough case against the 13R.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-design-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WEYLGyVXsFFWuYqNHJx5Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e is the spiritual successor of the iPhone SE but thankfully, Apple has finally done away with Touch ID and the thick bezels of that series. Instead, the 16e looks very much like the iPhone 14 with flat sides, front, and back. The bezels around the display are thicker than the iPhone 16 but that was to be expected. The phone sports Face ID in the old-style Apple notch and the mute switch has been replaced by the Action Button. You don't get the Camera Control button from the 16, which is fine.</p><p>The 16e gets a glass back, a USB-C port, and only eSIM support in U.S. models. Sadly, there are only two colors to choose from, white or black. My guess is Apple sort of knew that the 16e would not be that popular at launch, given the reduction in features and higher price than the SE, but we could see more colors added later in the year or with next year's revision based on how well it sells.</p><p>What you'll love with the iPhone 16e is the amazingly compact size and low weight. Compared to the 13R, the 16e is just 167 grams and measures only 7.8mm in thickness. That's a pretty slim and light phone, something that we don't see too many of in the Android world. The 16e is also IP68 rated which again trumps the IP65 rating of the 13R.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ScxcJvU3f2NQKUqcMUSY3e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is a massive phone compared to the 16e in dimensions and weight, but manages to be nearly as slim. It is built well with aluminum and glass all around and it looks like a typical Android flagship. You only get two colors here, Nebula Noir and Astral Trail, similar to the 16e. The 13R bears a lot of resemblance to the flagship OnePlus 13, just without the Hasselblad branding.</p><p>The 13R features the signature OnePlus slider for quickly changing alert modes, which is something the 16e's Action button can also be configured to do. There's USB-C with 80W fast charging, an IP65 rating, but no wireless charging.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-display-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jGr6Vb26huSnTYSorwu9Zo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e has a pretty good display for a budget iPhone. It's a 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED panel with a greater than Full-HD resolution, P3-color gamut support, and 1,200 nits of peak brightness for HDR content. Sadly, all non-Pro iPhones are still stuck with a 60Hz refresh rate and no always-on mode despite being an OLED screen. I guess it's going to take a lot more courage to add this than it did to remove the headphone jack. Thankfully, the display works just as well indoors as it does under direct sunlight, and we were quite happy with its performance when we tested it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R absolutely decimates the 16e's display with top-notch specs. It's a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED panel with a higher 2,780 x 1,264 resolution, and a refresh rate that can vary from 1Hz to 120Hz. For scratch protection, there's Gorilla Glass 7i, and it has a rated peak brightness of 4,500 nits. The sheer size of the display makes viewing any sort of content infinitely better. The cutout for the selfie camera is also unobtrusive, unlike the 16e's notch.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-hardware-and-battery-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Hardware and battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sg365XFeSSLidRTc9qft9e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e starts at $599 for 128GB of storage, $699 for 256GB, and $899 for 512GB. All variants feature 8GB of RAM since that's the minimum needed for Apple Intelligence. The base model is probably something most buyers would consider as paying anything more doesn't make sense for such compromised specs. The good thing is that you can easily get this via your carrier in the U.S. for a small monthly fee.</p><p>The iPhone 16e has the same A18 SoC found in the iPhone 16, but with one GPU core disabled. As a result, benchmark numbers are a bit lower but you'll barely notice any performance hit in real-world usage. All games run well and multitasking is a cakewalk for the 16e.</p><p>Battery life is also one of the big highlights here as the new in-house Apple C1 5G modem proves to be more power-efficient than any of the Qualcomm ones in other iPhone models. Coupled with a fairly large 3,961mAh capacity, you should easily get a full day's worth of usage out of it, or even more. There's fast charging but it's only 20W, which isn't really considered fast in 2025. The 16e does support wireless charging at 7.5W but nothing higher like you get with other iPhones with MagSafe charging.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13R is available as a single variant with 12GB of RAM and 256GB storage for $599.99, in the U.S.. It's not widely available from online retailers as of this writing, so your only option may be OnePlus.com. You'll also have to buy this unlocked only in the U.S., as none of the carriers offer any subsidies on it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R uses the powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 from Qualcomm, which can easily handle the most stressful apps and games without breaking a sweat. Unfortunately, eSIM is one feature we found missing from the 13R, but the SIM slot can accept two SIM cards.</p><p>Battery life is on another level thanks to the beastly 6,000mAh capacity. In our testing, the OnePlus 13R easily lasted two full days on one charge, which is pretty insane. That's almost twice as long as the 16e lasted. It misses out on wireless charging, but I don't think anyone will miss it since there's support for 80W charging. Plus, you get the compatible charger in the box, which is not the case with the 16e.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-cameras-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Cameras</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to believe it but the iPhone 16e has just a single camera on the back. Apple calls it a "2-in-1" camera system where the 2x zoom mode crops in on the sensor for a zoomed-in view, without having to use digital zoom. It's a trick Apple has been using on its iPhones for a while. Zooming in any further though reveals visible noise in photos, as we found out in our review. Despite its budget stature, the 16e can still record Dolby Vision videos at 4K 60fps. The front 12MP camera is similar to the iPhone 16. The 16e misses out on some camera features like Action mode and Cinematic mode, which are present on the 16.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R has an upgraded 50MP main sensor, which does a superb job of capturing fine details in still photos. Unlike the 16e, you get an ultrawide and telephoto camera on the back. We didn't find the secondary cameras to be too impressive, though. The telephoto, while nice to have, can only do 2x optical zoom, so anything beyond that is still digital. The 16MP selfie camera is also strictly okay.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-software-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e" name="Apple iPhone 16e" alt="Apple iPhone 16e review against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u4vj4uieypnqPF7tvBLr6e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16e is primed to get several major iOS versions for at least the next four years. Not to mention, you'll always get a new update along with every other iPhone on day one. The 16e is majorly about getting Apple Intelligence into the hands of more users and while many of the AI features are still in beta, we found some useful ones when we tested it. Visual Intelligence for instance works similar to Google Lens, and is able to look up locations and objects easily by simply pointing the camera at it.</p><p>The OnePlus 13R ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features" target="_blank">OxygenOS 15</a>, which is based on Android 15. OnePlus has pledged four years of OS upgrades which is decently long, but not great. The redesigned interface is slick and there are plenty of options to customize the look and feel to your liking. OnePlus isn't selling its AI features as aggressively as others, but there are a few useful ones baked in like AI Unblur and Reflection Eraser.</p>
<h2 id="iphone-16e-vs-oneplus-13r-which-should-you-pick-2">iPhone 16e vs. OnePlus 13R: Which should you pick?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo" name="OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13R review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SyXHkHQrvwWPstiejLpNVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13R is the more powerful and feature-rich phone of the two, and is the one I'd recommend to most buyers. Even in the U.S., if you don't mind putting down $600 in one go, you should get the 13R over the iPhone 16e. It has a vastly better and bigger display, a great set of cameras, excellent performance, superb battery life, and slick software. The lack of wireless charging and the lower IP rating is not that big of a blow if you ask me.</p><p>The iPhone 16e is a great starter iPhone for Apple Intelligence once the price drops closer to $500. At full price, you might as well look for a good deal on the iPhone 15 instead which has an ultrawide camera and MagSafe charging. The Pixel 9a also makes for a good alternative and is worth checking out. If you're coming from a really old iPhone like the last SE or the Xr, then the 16e is a good upgrade, but only during sales.</p>

<p>The feature may require a bit more setup to get going. If you don't have cross-device services setup, then you will be prompted to set this up to allow other devices to connect to your Pixel. This will take you through each Google email associated with your phone, and you can choose which devices to allow in a device group.</p><p>Make sure you have the other Pixel phone you want to use added to your device group. Once the group is set up, make sure to <strong>tap</strong> <strong>Add</strong> on the other Pixel when you receive the notification to join the device group.</p>

<p>Once it's all set up, it's time to try out Connected Cameras and see all the cool things it can do.</p>
<p>1. Once on and in a compatible app, you will find the floating <strong>Camera Picker</strong> option. If you leave this feature on all the time, simply touch and hold the Camera Picker in the app and drag it to the “X” at the bottom of the screen if you choose not to use it.</p><p>2. <strong>Tap the floating Camera Picker</strong> to view connected devices.</p><p>3. If you want to use a Pixel device, select <strong>Add Pixel</strong> as your remote camera. You will need to allow permissions on the secondary device to get started. (If you want to use a GoPro, go to <strong>Bluetooth, Connected Devices</strong>, and <strong>Pair new device</strong>, then put the camera in pairing mode and connect.)</p>

<h2 id="other-details-to-note-about-connected-cameras-2">Other details to note about Connected Cameras</h2>
<p>You can connect any of the supported devices to function as your remote camera with the Connected Cameras feature. However, the devices need to be signed into the same Google account. Only one remote camera can be connected at a time. If you want to use a different device, disconnect the first camera and connect the other.</p><p>When recording, audio comes from the camera that is currently in use, so keep this in mind to ensure you get favorable sound to complement your video. Also, note that if you use a Bluetooth audio source, it can degrade the streaming quality of your video.</p><p>Connected Cameras is a useful new feature with the Google Pixel 9 series devices, which count among <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>. It’s both convenient and fun for content creators looking to up their game or just experiment with recording and capturing moments in unique ways without having to own a complicated camera rig.</p>

<p><em><strong>Alex asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I saw the news about Google not complying with the EU regulations and I was wondering what would happen if Google just ignored it?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Can Google be banned in Europe? </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks </strong></em></p>
<p>Howdy Alex and thanks for such a great question!</p><p>Usually, I spend my thinking time wondering how Google will find ways to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/eu-commission-finds-that-google-search-and-play-store-fail-to-comply-with-dma">comply with laws and regulations</a> and still keep an advantage, and never thought about Google just saying no.</p><p>I've no doubt that's what it <em>really </em>wants to do: just laugh and keep on truckin' without a care. That's a way to make lots and lots of money, after all. But I don't think Google will. I also think the EU wouldn't go as far as kicking Google out of the continent (so to speak).</p>
<p>Normally, laws and regulations are set up as a compromise. A good example is how countries want factories to make goods but don't want them to just churn out pollution. A common ground must be found that benefits both sides and, in a best-case scenario, also benefits the citizenship. What we are seeing right now in the U.S. and elsewhere isn't quite normal, so it's easy to forget how it's <em>supposed</em> to work.</p><p>I think the EU's DMA (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-is-digital-markets-act">Digital Markets Act</a>) is a really good idea. It's not perfect, but no set of regulations will ever be perfect. I also agree with the rulings that Google is violating and want to see the company forced to do the right thing, even if it costs them a little bit of money in the end.</p><p>I say I think they will find a solution, but let's explore what happens if they don't.</p>
<h2 id="two-worst-case-scenarios-2">Two worst-case scenarios</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3" name="google-my-ads-center-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Google My Ad Center on a Chromebook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uCyqjgRgv6aNdMgFBZcHE3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1389" height="781" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>If Google were to just ignore the DMA rulings two very bad things could happen.</p><p>The first is that the company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-canada-trade-ban">banned from doing business</a> in the EU. While Google may be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-its-good-that-companies-like-google-face-antitrust-cases">unfairly using its status</a> to exert more control over things like payments and ads, a lot of people and companies are making money through the company. If Google were to be "banned," that means more than not being able to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-google-tv-streamers-best-feature-comes-to-more-streaming-devices">TV Streamers</a>; it means not being able to sell ad space or services like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-workspace-feature-drop-rolled-out-with-gemini-inclusion">Google Workspace,</a> and plenty of companies depend on those services.</p><p>Taking Google out of the picture would mean a mad scramble for companies to find replacements that might cost a lot more and could drive many of them out of business. EU regulators and Google both know this, and that's why I don't think this would ever happen — it would have a terrible effect on the very people the EU is claiming to protect and Google claims to want to serve.</p>
<p>Another possibility is even worse: Google says no, and the EU does nothing about it.</p><p>If Google were to just keep on doing business the way it always has, even though the DMA has ruled it can't, and <strong>nothing</strong> happens, it would open a floodgate. Other companies would see this and know that they might be able to ignore the law, and Google would 100% go further.</p><p>Imagine a trifecta of corporate greed consisting of Google, Meta, and Amazon, knowing they can do whatever they like without any repercussions. Executives would have visions of swimming in a pool filled with gold like Scrooge McDuck.</p><p>The reasons the DMA was enacted would then mean nothing, and companies would try to use any practices, fair or otherwise, to gain an advantage. Then they would use it.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-probably-happen-2">What will probably happen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ" name="Verizon-att-t-mobile-bribe.jpg" alt="Illustration of carriers taking money from someone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The EU is going to continue to make demands, and Google is going to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-beats-eu-antitrust-case-avoids-dollar17b-fine-for-ad-monopoly">continue to fight them</a>. This is normal behavior between two sides with different goals. It's a shame so much money will be spent to try to find common ground, but it is what it is.</p><p>Fines will be levied, which Google will appeal and protest. In the end, the rulings will be "bent" slightly, so Google wins a little bit, and the company will pay some money for being so stubborn about it. We're talking traffic ticket level of justice here, not something like execs facing jail time or anything. There will be no re-enactment of Bastille Day or guillotines involved.</p><p>This will also send the right message to others: we (the EU) will find a way to enforce our laws and reign you in; we're not afraid to fight it out. Then Google will find another way to skirt the rules until it gets caught. There is too much money to be made for it to go any other way.</p>

This is definitely a good thing, considering that it's really the only alternative to Google and Samsung.</p><p>Earlier in 2024, we saw the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/mobvoi-ticwatch-pro-5-enduro-review">TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro</a> released, and now, the TicWatch Atlas is here. Mobvoi must feel like it struck gold with the design of the TicWatch Pro 5, as the company has basically released three smartwatches that are almost identical, including the TicWatch Atlas.</p><p>Despite the name change, is the Atlas really all that different from the Enduro? Or is Mobvoi just trying to release something new for the sake of it?</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-price-and-availability"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Price and availability</span></h2>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-1" alt="TicWatch Atlas sitting in dirt and rocks" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9poxd2GLo8jT45v2U8bo7T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mobvoi announced the TicWatch Atlas in October 2024, arriving almost six months after the Pro 5 Enduro. It's still only available in one size, but there you can choose either the Black or Silver color way. The Atlas is priced at $349. It's currently available from Mobvoi directly, Amazon, and a few other online retailers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-what-i-like"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: What I like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-3" alt="TicWatch Atlas on wrist showing secondary screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M7xMiGGr8kB9uvj9qaT42T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On paper, there's really not much to write home about when it comes to what the TicWatch Atlas has to offer compared to the Enduro. In fact, the specs are identical, with the only difference being in the markings on the bezel surrounding the screen.</p><p>You might be wondering why I would include this in this section, and it's simply because Mobvoi's taken a "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" approach. Currently, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Plus Gen 1</a> is still the "newest" wearable SoC from Qualcomm. So I can't really give Mobvoi grief here, as it's not like the company has the capital and infrastructure to develop its own chip.</p><p>Plus, I have yet to deal with anything like stutters or slowdowns whenever I interact with the watch itself. Everything that the Atlas offers, just works, so I just really haven't found much to complain about.</p>

<p>It also helps that the Atlas continues Mobvoi's reign as the "battery champ" for wearables. Well, at least those that don't cost more than $500. I love being able to have a smartwatch that lasts for two to three days at a minimum but usually lasts even longer.</p><p>As I've said in my previous TicWatch reviews, I'm a big fan of the size, even if it isn't for everyone. Thankfully, for me, at least, that trend continues with the Atlas, as the watch just rests nicely on my wrist. Although I do have to point out that I wish there were more 24mm bands to choose from, that's not Mobvoi's fault.</p>

<p>This is all made possible by Mobvoi's dual-screen display, combining a 1.43-inch OLED screen with an Ultra low-power display. Just like previous iterations, this secondary screen basically operates as the "always-on display" but shows more information than just the time, date, and battery life.</p><p>You'll also find all of the "normal" stuff at your disposal, such as sleep tracking, a variety of workouts, blood oxygen monitoring, and more. There's even a new "Heat Map" feature, which Mobvoi says will keep track of "where you're most active" during a game. It's an interesting addition, but it isn't something that I actually tried because I don't play sports anymore unless you count the "run to keep my son from falling and bumping his head" game.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: What I don't like</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="tegawp8PXfrN5a8dhZNQuS" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-7" alt="Side profile view of TicWatch Pro 5 Enduro and TicWatch Atlas" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tegawp8PXfrN5a8dhZNQuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the one hand, I want to give Mobvoi some kudos for releasing the TicWatch Atlas with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-4">Wear OS 4</a>. And while I want to give the company grief about the lack of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a>, it's tough to do so when Google itself is dealing with rollout struggles for older hardware.</p><p>But there's one thing missing, literally one thing, that's making me go right back to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> as soon as I'm done with this review — Google Assistant/Gemini. I don't care (all that much) that Wear OS 5 isn't available yet, partially because I've just accepted the fact that it'll probably be another year before it comes to the Pro 5, Enduro, or Atlas.</p><p>It's great being able to download and install apps from the Play Store while enjoying them on the Atlas's big OLED screen. But that fun starts to fade away when you expect (or at least hope) that the basic functions of similar smartwatches are just not there.</p><p>Searching for Assistant in the Play Store on the Atlas pulls up a bunch of results that don't matter. And while I've read about a few workarounds, I haven't tried them simply because I shouldn't have to. So, as much as I have truly enjoyed what Mobvoi has done over the past couple of years, I just can't get over this hurdle.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-4" alt="TicWatch Atlas next to Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra and Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6zqBc6gYeCRLLeQBPwmg3T.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that I've started to notice is that my wrist will vibrate. I'll look at the watch, and there's nothing. Nothing on my phone, nothing hidden in the notification tray, just nothing.</p><p>It seems that this might not actually be a problem with the Atlas specifically, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/galaxy-watch-7-ghost-vibrations-user-reports">Galaxy Watch 7 owners</a> have reported similar issues. Since Samsung's latest wearable uses Wear OS 5, it's not like we can point to Wear OS 4 as the source of the problems.</p><p>Another gripe that I have is that I don't fully understand Mobvoi's wearable strategy. Going from the Pro 5 to the Pro 5 Enduro made sense, as the latter was just an iteration of the original. But here's the thing: the Atlas is just an iteration of the Enduro.</p><p>For some reason, Mobvoi opted to start an entirely "new" lineup of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> with the Atlas despite only including very minor and subtle changes. While I'm not advocating for some type of drastic redesign, I think Mobvoi might have been better suited to go with the "TicWatch Pro 5 Atlas" instead. Or even use a different word, reserving "Atlas" for a different lineup.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-mobvoi-ticwatch-atlas-competition"><span>Mobvoi TicWatch Atlas: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-run-activity.jpeg" alt="The main run activity data screen on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tpd5FVeGcDAeu3mAesDZd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This would have been the year for the Atlas to really compete with the Galaxy Watch Classic. However, Samsung opted to ditch that version entirely this year, opting instead to go with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Watch Ultra</a>. So when it comes to price, the Atlas is more of a competitor to the Watch 7, seeing as it's just $50 more.</p><p>That being said, Samsung's latest wearable wins out thanks to having <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> out of the box, along with the ability to actually use Google Assistant. Plus, since Samsung uses smaller band sizes, you have many more options to choose from if you want to swap out the included band for something else.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> is another viable competitor, although neither of Samsung's or Google's offers are going to be quite as durable as the Atlas. For the first time, Google offers two different sizes with the Watch 3, solving one of my big annoyances with the Pixel Watch and Watch 2.</p><p>Although Google is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-1-and-2-users-will-have-to-wait-for-wear-os-5">dealing with issues</a> surrounding the Wear OS 5 update for its first two smartwatches, that's not the case with the Watch 3. Even still, you get to enjoy <em>all</em> of the luxuries that Wear OS has to offer, without worrying about making any sacrifices.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC" name="oneplus-watch-3-battery-modes" alt="The two battery modes of the OnePlus Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c4Z2Qxc2HNYK7fALtXxBQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> seemingly came out of nowhere to challenge the Atlas for the title of "Battery King." The Watch 3 is rated for up to six days on a single charge, which can be stretched to seven if you turn off AOD and sleep tracking. But it also has the added benefit of super-fast charging, with a 20-minute charge adding "about 75% to the battery, and another 20 minutes will bring it to a full charge."</p><p>That's not to say the Watch 3 is perfect. Those in North America can't use the built-in ECG, and like the Atlas, it lacks LTE connectivity and is only available in one size. But along with being less expensive, OnePlus has already committed to two software updates and quarterly security patches.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="edzrvhsrH8iSWMx945KmuS" name="ticwatch-atlas-review-2" alt="TicWatch Atlas on wrist showing primary display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edzrvhsrH8iSWMx945KmuS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the best battery life in a Wear OS smartwatch.</li><li>You want a rugged smartwatch for under $400.</li><li>You don't care about having the latest version of Wear OS.</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to be able to use Google Assistant.</li><li>You already own the TicWatch Pro 5 or Pro 5 Enduro.</li><li>You're on a budget.</li></ul>
<p>Maybe it's because I've already used and reviewed both the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ticwatch-pro-5-review">TicWatch Pro 5</a> and Pro 5 Enduro, but I just haven't found a reason to be super excited about the Atlas. There are very few differences between the Atlas and the Enduro, with the exception of the slight design changes to the case. With that in mind, if you already have the Enduro or even the Pro 5, you're probably better off just waiting to see what the next Mobvoi release brings.</p><p>I'm even having a difficult time recommending the Atlas even if you <em>don't</em> have the Pro 5 or the Enduro, simply because the Enduro has been discounted to $279. But unless you <em>really</em> like the differences in the casing, save yourself a few bucks and get the Enduro.</p><p>Hopefully, Qualcomm will release a new wearable chip, giving Mobvoi the opportunity to go back to the drawing board. Heck, if it could re-release the Atlas with a new chip and Wear OS 5, I'd be happy. Well, as long as it meant that I could finally use Google Assistant.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly working on adding Veo 2's video-generation capabilities in its Gemini app.</li><li>The model could give users a way to create short video clips, which will leverage Veo 2's high-quality generation software.</li><li>Google highlighted Veo 2 in December with its high-quality 4K resolution and its ability to understand a user's complex descriptions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A report claims Google is working to bring a little more video-generation magic to Gemini in an upcoming update.</p><p>As spotted in an APK dive by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/gemini-app-veo-video-generation/">9to5Google</a>, the company has reportedly started adding code to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini app</a> in preparation for Veo 2. The post claims development has been ongoing over the "past several weeks," but the recently spotted code gives a little more to chew on. The publication discovered a description reading that states users will be able to "describe" their idea and "Veo 2 will bring it to life with an 8-second video."</p><p>After generating, similar to having the AI make an image, users may be able to download their AI-generated clip. Additionally, code evidence lends the publication to believe there will be a video player, as well (which would make sense).</p><p>Elsewhere, the post highlights the potential for Google to impose a "limit" on how many videos users can create in Gemini using Veo 2. One string states "You’ve reached your video generation limit until tomorrow." Another mentions the existence of a "monthly limit," too. More information on this is still in the dark, though there's speculation Google could push Veo 2's access behind <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini's paid tier</a>.</p><p>How this feature will exactly look and work for the end-user wasn't readily available as Google is still likely a bit early on in its development.</p>

<p>In December, after Veo's introduction at I/O 2024, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">debuted Veo 2</a>, which was an updated version of the model that would let users generate "incredibly high-quality" videos. The company stated users could use their imagination and create videos covering a wide range of styles and subjects. The max resolution of Veo 2's videos were reportedly 4K and the AI model even has the capability to understand your complex queries/descriptions.</p><p>Since December, Veo 2 has been placed in Google Labs' VideoFX test and remains there still. Rumors of video-generation arriving in Gemini <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-might-be-prepping-ai-video-generation-for-a-future-update">started in February</a>. The early code was much more barebones than what we're seeing reported today; however, it seems Google is still on track to deliver it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google has been slowly stepping more and more into video generation, especially when you consider <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/made-by-youtube-2024-ai-hype-updates">YouTube's interest in Veo</a>. A Made by YouTube update in September highlighted the platform's interest in Google's DeepMind AI video-generation software to help its creators. It showcased work toward placing Veo's capabilities in Shorts creation.</p><p>This would generate a six-second clip for creators to use in their Shorts to enhance them with new concepts. Moreover, Google recently rolled out an update for its Vids app, which lets it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-vids-can-now-generate-ai-voiceovers-for-your-videos">create AI-generated voiceovers</a> for your projects. This can be utilized through the Vids app's "Help me create" prompt for its AI assistance. It's worth noting that this is rolling out for Workspace customers in a wide range of tiers and plans.</p>

<p>Google’s lineup of phones is becoming bloated, and I think the company should have merged the Pixel 9 and 9a into one phone and changed specs and pricing options.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/pixel-9a-arrives-with-a-fresh-new-look">9a launched on March 19,</a> coming with a new design and ditching the usual pill-shaped aluminum camera bar for a flat rear panel. Priced at $499, the phone comes with AI features, including Gemini Live, Add Me, Magic Editor, the Tensor G4 chip, and seven years of OS and security updates. <br><br>So, with all of these great features at a fantastic price, why should anyone bother buying the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a" target="_blank">Pixel 9</a> (starting at $799) when it seems the 9a has similar, if not better, features and is $300 cheaper?</p><p>Like my colleague, Andrew Myrick, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/there-are-too-many-pixel-phones">wrote last year</a>, it’s time for Google to rethink its lineup of devices and streamline its offerings.</p><p>And it turns out I'm not the only one who thinks Google needs to revamp its Pixel lineup. So does Android Authority <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-needs-to-rethink-pixel-phones-3535200/">in their recent article</a>. That said, I don't know if I agree that Google should take the iPhone route with its lineup.</p>

<p>I asked Google if there were really enough consumers to justify releasing a Pixel 9 and a 9a, and I was told there was.</p><p>“When we look at our devices, the goal is really to deliver the core Pixel experience and deliver on that incredible camera, the incredible Google AI, and then access to the latest version of Android. [Pixel] 9 is leveling off of those experiences. So there’s a significant boost in image quality, based on the sensors we use in 9, and the capabilities of that camera are quite better than what we have in the A series.”</p><p>“Similarly, from a charging perspective, we find that the 9 serves a user that may be looking for that faster charging experience. And then finally, the display on our 9 devices tends to be of a higher quality than what’s on our A series,” said Shenaz Zack Mistry, senior director of product management for Pixel.</p><p>Google says that there is a user that might want a little more and that from their “portfolio perspective…we have just as many users on that premium tier as we do in our entry tier. So we do believe there’s users in both of those categories.”</p>

<p>The Pixel 9 launched in September 2024, giving consumers at least six months with a phone that has very similar features to the new 9a.</p><p>Per this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-pixel-9">Pixel 9a vs. Pixel 9</a> comparison chart, you can see that there are several features that the 9a has that are similar to or even better than the 9, but the phone launches much later than the 9. This means consumers will have to wait for a cheaper phone with Pro-like features and specs.</p>

<p>Senior editor Andrew Myrick made a point when the Pixel launched its 9 series that the company has too many Pixel phones, saying that it might be “a bit overwhelming to some.” Making a similar argument that the A series is priced much lower than the regular base Pixel.</p><p>So, I think Google should have merged the 9 and 9a and offered a much better phone at a reasonable price point somewhere between the two, which would allow Google to still get a great ROI.</p><p>The Pixel 9 is able to perform well because of the higher RAM, and as a result, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> features work seamlessly and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-on-device-ai-processing-is-important">on-device</a>, a lacking feature in the 9a. I think the blended phone should have a higher RAM to offer the features the 9a isn’t able to do so, but at the same time, it should still offer the other compromises that keep the phone from performing at a Pro level and, therefore, keeping the price down.</p><p>I personally do not think that many people care about wireless charging, so maintaining wireless charging at the 9a level, in my opinion, is fine and, as a result, does not require more expensive components to increase the cost of the overall phone.</p><p>The blended phone would have the 9a battery size and the same camera features as the 9, but if Google wanted to save on some cost, then using cheaper sensors might be smart, for example.</p><p>Since the processor is the same for both phones, you know the blended phone will still be of top quality.</p><p>The most important thing here is the price of the phone. This merged phone would cost around $600 or $650; the perfect in-between while still keeping it fairly affordable. In fact, if Google needs an example of how to make an affordable flagship-like phone, it only needs to look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-vs-oneplus-13r">OnePlus 13R</a>, which offers incredible value and specs for the price.</p>

<p>I know that my reality of what I want from Google may not happen. However, I do think that Google needs to figure out its strategy between the two phones.</p><p>Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, agrees.</p><p>He said in 2024, Pixel shipments grew 5.9%, and in the year prior grew 55.4%. I’m going to guess the increase in sales in 2023 was because of the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8">Pixel 8 series</a>, which included Google’s suite of AI features for the first time in a lineup of phones.</p><p>Urbani notes that the share of the Pixel A series has generally been shrinking for the past few years and accounted for 32.1% (almost a third) in 2024. Meanwhile, the share of base Pixel has only trended down slightly while the Pro and Fold versions have gained a share, he said.</p><p>That said, Ubrani notes that while the A series market share is shrinking, there still is a need for the A series because it represents a significant share of Pixels in markets. Assuming the A series continues to shrink in share, Ubrani says that then, in the next few iterations, it may make sense to discontinue it.</p><p>“However, it’s important to realize that the A series doesn’t just bring in a different customer due to the significantly lower price point, it also provides a healthy bump to overall Pixel brand marketing during the year when there’s usually a bit of a slump in the middle of the year,” he said.</p><p>So, if we were to continue with the trajectory of a base Pixel model and one that is part of the A series, then I think Google really needs to figure out a way to differentiate the base model.</p><p>We know from some recent leaks that the Pixel 10 will have a few more upgrades that make it stand out a little more than it has in the past. The biggest potential change is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-render-leak-reveal-identical-design">a triple-camera setup</a>.</p><p>And if Google choses to include that third camera, then it has to make sure that a third camera isn’t also happening in a future Pixel 10a, otherwise, we’ll be back to square one of what is the point of having these two phones.</p>

<ul><li>Google's Japan X account has started teasing an upcoming collaboration with K-Pop girl group, BABYMONSTER.</li><li>The collab will bring an "Imagination Studio" to fans in Shibuya, Japan on March 29.</li><li>Google became the official smartphone of the Australian Open earlier this year, which saw it bring the Pixel Studio to life for fans to engage with.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is teasing something new going on with its Pixel ecosystem later this week overseas.</p><p>The company's Japanese account has started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1903748557318070550">posting teaser images</a> on X of what's to come, beginning with one that spells the date: March 29, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/24/google-teases-new-pixel-imagination-studio-coming-on-march-29/#more-666177">9to5Google</a>). In this first image, Google provided a photo of "Google Pixel;" however, the "P" in Pixel sports a couple of devilish (or monstrous) horns. Moreover, the post is accompanied by seven emojis, six of them and multicolored hearts with one that's a purple imp.</p><p>Users quickly replied, tossing in their assumptions behind what was being teased, to which they claimed it was BABYMONSTER, a South Korean Girl group (K-Pop).</p><p>Google followed up recently with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/googlejapan/status/1904095846427148558">one more post</a> from its Japanese account with more solid evidence for users' speculation. The machine-translated post says "Monster pop-up coming soon." Additionally, the photo teases something called "Imagination Studio" and the location of the pop-up store in Shibuya, Japan. Google also showcases seven silhouettes at the bottom of its image, which shows off the seven members of BABYMONSTER: Rami, Ahyeon, Chiquita, Asa, Rora, Pharita, and Ruka.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">モンスター級のポップアップ、もうすぐ。#GooglePixel pic.twitter.com/mQkFu3Isye<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1904095846427148558">March 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from the images to get people excited, Google didn't offer anything more on what "Imagination Studio" could be. The company also doesn't explain if this studio will be the sole purpose of this pop-up event. The publication speculates it could have something to do with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-pixel-studio">Pixel Studio</a> and its recent ability to "generate images with people." That remains to be seen but, luckily, we don't have to wait that long.</p><p>In the meantime, Google kicked off a collaboration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-is-the-official-smartphone-of-the-australian-open">the Australian Open</a>, becoming its official smartphone in an attempt to reach a more global audience. To celebrate, at the beginning of January, the company set up a real-life Pixel Studio at Rod Laver Arena. It gave fans a chance to get hands-on with the Pixel 9 Pro's features, which also boasted a suite of AI features.</p><p>Google also provided expert "coaches" to assist fans in capturing their best shots and appropriately utilize the Pixel 9 Pro's AI editing tools.</p>

And are currently investigating the situation, "to address it as quickly as possible – we’ll share more details when a fix is ready," Google added.</p>

<ul><li>Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be messing up some features on the Pixel Watch 3 and Watch 2.</li><li>Users have reported delayed notifications, inaccurate step counts, battery issues, and more.</li><li>While Google has yet to acknowledge the bugs, restarting or factory resetting the wearable seems to temporarily fix some of the issues.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The March Wear OS update is rolling out, and it has already started causing some issues for users. The Wear OS 5.1 update seems to be delaying notifications, inaccurately showing steps, causing battery issues, and more (first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-watch-march-2025-update-brings-delayed-notifications-bugs/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Since Mar. 18, Google has been pushing out the Wear OS 5.1 update for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a>, Pixel Watch 2, and the original Pixel Watch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/google-lte-pixel-watches-wear-os-5-1-rollout-spotted">broader rollout to LTE watches</a> happened last week, with the LTE Pixel Watch 2 and 3 seeing version <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W3</strong> and the O.G device seeing <strong>BP1A.250305.019.W2</strong> version of the update come in.</p><p>At the start of March, Google announced the feature rollout to wearables, with the new Loss of Pulse and menstrual health support coming to the Pixel Watch 3. Other watches received tweaks to features that improved audio controls, step count tracking, and expansion of auto bed-time mode.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3061px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5" name="pixel-watch-3-myfitnesspal-app" alt="The MyFitnessPal app on the Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5xtzUTUEH7f4PQTujsfYi5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3061" height="1722" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it looks like the patch brought some unexpected bugs as well to these watches. Over the weekend, those who updated their watch to the latest firmware seem to be facing all kinds of issues with their wearables. Several people took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/PixelWatch/comments/1jhzriq/anyone_else_facing_issues_with_pixel_watch_3/">Reddit</a> to express their frustration about this rather messy update that has made their watches slower than usual.</p><p>Several Pixel Watch 2 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-3-gets-fda-approval-for-loss-of-pulse-detection-in-us">Pixel Watch 3 </a>owners reported that notifications seemed to be delayed and were only displayed when the user manually wakes the watch, after which they are flooded by multiple notifications all at once.</p><p>Other users feel that the update has messed up their step counter — the watch seems to be counting steps and detecting floors climbed, even when the user has taken it off. It also seems to be detecting way more steps than usual, according to another user who said they only walked 5K steps, but the watch seems to have tracked about 17K.</p><p>Additionally, these bugs have supposedly started draining the watch's battery. The publication added that some users have been dealing with the watch crashing when all they did was try to change or edit a watch face's complications or colors.</p><p>For now, users on the same Reddit thread seem to have come up with a workaround to solve this issue. They said factory resetting the watch seems to be solving some of these issues, while some feel that simply restarting the watch does the job, but only temporarily.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some users thanked the Google gods as they didn't face any of the above issues with the new update. For now, Google hasn't officially acknowledged the issue. However, Android Central has reached out to the company and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>The Nexode Power Bank Genshin Impact Edition is a 2000mAh power bank with three charging ports in total, with a cumulative power budget of 130W. The facade of the power bank has a Kinich-themed design along with K'uhul Ajaw, and it looks pretty distinctive — much more so than the regular model. The sides have Scions of the Canopy and Yumkasaurus graffiti, and the bottom has a pixelized K'uhul Ajaw.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3" name="UGREEN Genshin Impact" alt="UGREEN x Genshin Impact collection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hjnAkuZrH2dw7ZPjCfZaP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The design is definitely attention-grabbing, and even the USB-C connectors are decked out in green. Thankfully, you still get a panel showcasing real-time charging and battery level, and it makes using it that much more convenient. I used the 20000mAh and 25000mAh Nexode power banks quite a bit in the last six months, and they're now my go-to choice while traveling.</p>

<p>The USB-C1 port hits 100W, with the USB-C2 going up to 30W, and USB-A hitting 22.5W. It does a good job charging up to three devices at once, and I didn't have any problems with the Pixel 9 Pro XL, Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and Vivo X200 Pro. The regular 20000mAh Nexode power bank <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-20000mAh-Portable-Charger-Charging/dp/B0CXHNGDC1">is down to $63 on Amazon</a>, so you are paying a little extra to get the variant with the Kinich styling. That said, it's still a great choice, and the product itself is identical to the standard 130W model that I've used extensively.</p>

<p>UGREEN's best-selling product is the Nexode 65W charger, so it isn't too astonishing that the brand chose this particular model to get a Genshin makeover. The only issue I have with the Nexode Charger Genshin Impact Edition is that the Nexode Pro is a better choice overall, and the brand should have used that as the foundation instead.</p>

<p>Regardless, the Nexode 65W is still a strong GaN charger, and it has dual USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port. UGREEN also sells another model with a UK plug, and the small size makes it a good recommendation if you need a travel-friendly charger. The regular Nexode 65W charger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-Gallium-Nitride-Charger-Black/dp/B091BGMKYS">is down to $25</a>, and the Genshin-styled variant can be bought for $39.</p>

<p>It's great to see Qi2 charging accessories gaining momentum, and this 2-in-1 is effective at charging a phone over Qi2 as well as an accessory. The best part is that it has a USB-C port on the side, so you can charge a third device as well, albeit at 5W.</p>

<p>The design is pretty cool, with the charging stand featuring the Yumkasaurus pattern and Kinich’s Elemental Skill aiming frame. The foldable design is ideal for portability, and it has a good swivel action — I had no issues using it with the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The regular product usually costs $38, and the Genshin model is now available for $59.</p>

<p>It's always good to see a colorful USB-C cable, and UGREEN decked out the braided cable in a bright green hue, with a K'uhul Ajaw cable tie and Dendro styling at the connectors. It goes up to 100W over USB PD, and is available in a single 1-meter variant. At $9, it's just as affordable as the regular model.</p>

<p>UGREEN sent the new products in a custom gift box that's designed to look like a loot chest, and it is extravagant. The brand did a brilliant job with the packaging in general; I unboxed limited-edition phones that didn't have anywhere close to this level of attention to detail.</p>

<p>As to why the brand went with Kinich, UGREEN says: "As a skilled Saurian Hunter, Kinich is steady, direct, and efficient in combat. These qualities align with UGREEN’s brand identity and mission. The cobranded products excel in charging speed, providing gamers and users with an efficient and reliable charging experience. Kinich wields the power of Dendro and his character design primarily uses green, aligning with UGREEN’s brand colors. The pixelation in his design also matches with the digital nature of UGREEN's electronics."</p>

<p>In addition to the Genshin Impact-branded accessories, UGREEN bundled a set of add-ons, including a phone grip, power bank pouch, lanyard, and acrylic stands. It definitely makes unboxing the packaging more of an occasion, and I like that all the products have a distinct green styling.</p>

<p>While the packaging is noteworthy in its own right, UGREEN mentions that the Genshin Impact merchandise and the gift box won't be available at retail. However, the brand is running giveaways on its site and social media channels. Overall, UGREEN did all the right things with the collaboration, and while you are paying more solely based on the aesthetics, the products are distinctive to say the least.</p>

<ul><li>WhatsApp’s new “Layout” feature enables users to share collaged photos as status updates, similar to Instagram’s Stories.</li><li>Users can select from multiple grid options to share up to six photos from their Android gallery.</li><li>The feature is currently hidden and in testing, with a demo showcasing its potential appearance and functionality.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>WhatsApp was found testing a new feature that is popular on Meta's other social media platforms like Instagram. The feature allows users to share collaged pics as status updates.</p><p>According to an APK Insight performed by folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/whatsapp-layouts-status-update-apk-teardown-3536549/">Android Authority</a>, the messaging app was seen using a new “Layout” feature, which helps users pick a collage layout to post multiple pictures at once while sharing them as status updates. It is similar to Instagram’s Stories feature as it also supports layout photo sharing format.</p><p>With the new upcoming WhatsApp feature, the aim here is to keep the status updates cleaner than clumsy as is the case now when users want to share multiple photos at once. The Layout feature allows users to share up to six photos at once and they can be picked up from their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>’s gallery, and it additionally provides multiple grid options to choose from.</p>

<p>While currently hidden, the feature's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8TF21z_Xk8U">showcased demo</a> by the publication gives us an idea of how the "Layouts" will supposedly look when it rolls out to the masses shortly.</p><p>Users can head over to the status page and hit the camera icon, which takes them to the phone’s gallery the Layout option should be seen right next to the “voice” and “music” options, and they can add the preferred six photos and choose from the provided grid styles. The final status update screen, however, remains to be seen as the feature is still in the testing phase.</p><p>WhatsApp Status has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-gets-status-liking-feature-and-private-mentions">significant improvements</a> over the past few months. They've started allowing users to like the status updates alongside allowing users to privately mention their friends from the contacts, who can further repost the update as their status update. All these features are also borrowed from Instagram, and the upcoming new one might soon be added to that list.</p>
