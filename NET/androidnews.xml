CAD renders of the alleged Pixel 10 trio surfaced online with so much clarity that we thought it was the real deal. The renders were shared by tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank">OnLeaks</a>, revealing all the design and hardware of the device.</p><p>According to the tipster, not much could change in the next-gen Pixel. That said, it seems like the base model renders add an extra lens, giving it a triple camera array. Meanwhile, the other two models will stick to the same design with no significant hardware changes. However, the devices could obviously see some internal and software upgrades, including the new and powerful <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">Tensor G5</a> chip.</p><p>We are hoping to catch a glimpse of the next flagship at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-io-2022-preview">Google I/O event.</a> While we wait, here's a look at what we'd wish to see with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a>.</p>

According to the post, their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>'s display would flicker, and they'd suffer an "abrupt brightness drop" roughly "every 10 seconds."

In a press release, the company said that Android 16 Beta 3 has reached the "Platform Stability" stage and that this will be available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta" target="_blank">enrolled users, including those with Pixels</a>.</p><p>This beta version is bringing a new accessibility tool for those with low vision. To help these users, the OS will outline text and change the background color of the text box, making the text pop and increasing legibility. Next is "Local Network Protection," which will essentially act as a gatekeeper for home devices. It will seek permission when an app tries to access/connect to devices like printers, smart TVs, or any other gadget that shares your Wi-Fi or Data — giving more control to the user.</p><p>Along with the above features, Google is finally bringing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>" support to Pixels, which allows audio to be broadcast from one source to several others.

The upgrade is said to take personalization to a whole new level since Gemini will be able to interact with other apps on the phone to understand the user's choices better.</p><p>Google added that this switch to Gemini will happen "in the coming months." By the end of this year, people will not be able to download Google Assistant from app stores as it will be discontinued.</p>

<p>Before calling me crazy, hear me out. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a> is undoubtedly a gorgeous device. It's the pinnacle of innovation and definitely one of the most exciting phones we've seen in a long time.</p><p>I live in Southeast Asia, so it's actually possible for me to walk into a store and purchase one. The North American market doesn't have that option. The problem is, though, that innovation is expensive.</p><p>In my locale, the Mate XT is priced at RM14,999, which is about $3,372 when converted to USD. Even if I dared to dream about owning one, I'd have to consider selling one of my kidneys. To be fully candid, that's the amount I spent to purchase my car.</p><p>In fact, almost all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> are steeply priced. However, this is the most expensive folding phone the world has ever seen.</p><p>So yes, even though the Mate XT is a marvel of this technological era, and I do find it invigorating, the device has an unrealistic appeal. I can't afford to buy it, and even if I could, I don't imagine myself shelling out that much dough for a phone. Heck, I'd rather buy another car with that amount!</p>
<h2 id="not-all-foldables-will-bankrupt-you-2">Not all foldables will bankrupt you</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zoszeTXpaSAbu7hGunnY9D" name="TECNO-Phantom-V-Flip-2-review-09.jpg" alt="TECNO Phantom V Flip 2 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zoszeTXpaSAbu7hGunnY9D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4139" height="2328" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I don't want to put a damper on your enthusiasm. Feats such as the one Huawei achieved should be celebrated. And if you're a person with that much spare cash to burn, by all means, you should get the device. It's an absolutely lovely piece of technology.</p><p>As for myself, I've turned my gaze towards more humble brands such as Infinix and TECNO because they feel more realistically accessible. Also, Motorola doesn't sell foldables in my region despite selling some attractive, low-priced flip phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-2024-review">Razr 2024</a>. See, I feel like Infinix can actually bring the concept tri-fold to life and sell it at a more easily digestible asking price.</p><p>It feels like yesterday when TECNO first debuted the impossibly affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phantom-v-flip-review">Phantom V Flip</a>. I was stunned when the $600 price was revealed and then impressed when the brand did it again with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a>.</p><p>A little-known fact is that Infinix and TECNO are both owned by smartphone manufacturer Transsion Holdings, much like BBK Electronics owns OnePlus, OPPO, Vivo, and Realme. This means that the sister brands most probably have access to each other's research and development.</p><p>This leads me to believe that if TECNO can do it, so can Infinix. The tri-fold might not be as cheap as the $700 Phantom V Flip 2, but it'll definitely be a whole lot cheaper than the $3,300 Huawei Mate XT.</p><p>And this is the main reason why the Infinix Zero Mini tri-fold, to me, is a lot more exciting.</p>

The main camera takes unbelievable images and videos, and the 200MP telephoto at the back is the best you'll find today. The software is better than previous years, and honestly, there isn't much to critique with the device — the X200 Pro continues to be my favorite phone of 2025. </p></p>

<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-pro-vs-vivo-x200-pro-design-2">OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro: Design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xKgyTrqMuDTLZWEmqZHB93" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xKgyTrqMuDTLZWEmqZHB93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO was onto a good thing with the design of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a>, with a dual-tone color scheme and leather back making the device stand out quite a bit. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, however, doesn't quite have that same flair, with the device switching to a flat profile, and featuring a plain back with a silky texture.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vX79YX2pn2DeFud8ccjt63" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vX79YX2pn2DeFud8ccjt63.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It still looks good, but I don't like the design as much as its predecessors, considering the Find X3 Pro, Find X5 Pro, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a> all had attention-grabbing backs. Although the design isn't quite as striking, the device is great to hold and use, and the design of the camera housing is cleaner, and the module itself doesn't protrude as much.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9bbv9XSGRWXxXTZZRKwtt" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9bbv9XSGRWXxXTZZRKwtt.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By contrast, Vivo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a> has a much more elegant design this time than previous years. The grey model looks great in its own right, but if you're interested in this phone, I highly recommend getting the blue option — it looks absolutely incredible. The X200 Pro is thicker and 13g heavier than the Find X8 Pro, and if anything, I like the in-hand feel of the device better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="b5F5Af4eqZSAxz7gsP9wH3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5F5Af4eqZSAxz7gsP9wH3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While both phones have flat sides, they have beveled edges that make it easier to hold the devices. The X200 Pro has a sizeable camera module at the back, but even then, it has better weight distribution, and I like the added heft. Vivo uses the best ultrasonic modules on its phones, and that's no different on the X200 Pro — it is fast to unlock and doesn't have any issues even with oily or wet fingers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aHLD7Hu3ZREWtMUaVhgoJ3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aHLD7Hu3ZREWtMUaVhgoJ3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones get IP68 alongside the new IP69 ingress protection, and the Find X8 Pro has the alert slider on the left, making it easy to switch between ring, vibrate, and silent modes. Overall, these are two of the best phones of 2025, and while they both look good, I much prefer the styling of the X200 Pro.</p>
<h2 id="oppo-find-x8-pro-vs-vivo-x200-pro-panel-2">OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro: Panel</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="j2uEZVoxPgUsCpYnRnZTA3" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j2uEZVoxPgUsCpYnRnZTA3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both phones have similar-sized 6.78-inch AMOLED panels, and they go up to 4500 nits. You get all the extras: 120Hz refresh, Dolby Vision and HDR10+, Ultra HDR, and extensive customizability when adjusting the color balance. As you'd imagine in this category, both devices hold up incredibly well, and there are no issues in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AHHBj6qHTCAjKNNnegjG33" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AHHBj6qHTCAjKNNnegjG33.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, the X200 Pro gets brighter outdoors and in regular use. In fact, only the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a brighter panel, and the X200 Pro comes in at a close second. The Find X8 Pro doesn't have any shortcomings either, but it doesn't get quite as bright. There's good stereo sound on both devices, and it's adequate if you're just gaming casually.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8KPXfk2sWEpRK6Hjf57n83" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8KPXfk2sWEpRK6Hjf57n83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On that note, the Find X8 Pro still limits most games to 60fps, and it is annoying considering the MediaTek platform doesn't have any issues pushing high framerates even in demanding titles. The X200 Pro is better in this regard, and in general, I prefer its color calibration out of the box. OPPO chose Gorilla Glass 7i this time, with Vivo using a custom solution; both phones hold up well to tumbles, and I thankfully didn't see any problems.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SqhhLcBRF6uw5ZVBmfAi83" name="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X8 Pro vs. Vivo X200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SqhhLcBRF6uw5ZVBmfAi83.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There isn't much to differentiate either device when it comes to the hardware. Both phones are powered by MediaTek's Dimensity 9400, and they're just as fast as their Qualcomm-powered rivals, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. They do a fantastic job with gaming as well, and the only issue I have is that the Find X8 Pro doesn't enable 120fps gaming although it can easily do so. <br><br>Outside of that, there are no problems whatsoever. Both phones play demanding games with relative ease, and I got stable framerates without any lag or jitter. There wasn't much in the way of overheating either, and this is where MediaTek has an advantage over Qualcomm this year — all the Qualcomm-based phones run hotter while running the same games.</p>

<p>Connectivity is rock-solid on either device, and they both get a good vibration motor that delivers granular feedback while using the keyboard and navigating the interface. Basically, there just isn't anything to fault when it comes to the internals on either device, and it's clear that the switch to MediaTek was absolutely the right move this year. <br><br>Talking about getting things right, both phones have massive batteries, and they last a day and a half on average. The Find X8 Pro gets a 5910mAh battery, with the X200 Pro packing a 6000mAh unit. Both devices leverage silicon battery tech to great effect, delivering increased density and longevity.</p>

<p>When it comes to battery life, the X200 Pro is the best phone I used this year. There isn't another device that lasts as long, and even with heavy use, I got over a day's use. The Find X8 Pro is a close second, and it also lasts over a day, but the battery life is a smidgen lower than the X200 Pro. <br><br>The Find X8 Pro gets 80W charging, but what I like is that it goes up to 50W over USB PD, and it makes charging the device with a regular GaN charger effortless. The X200 Pro uses Vivo's custom charging protocol and goes up to 90W, and either device takes just 50 minutes to charge the battery.</p>

<p>Make no mistake; these are two of the best cameras of 2025. In fact, the X200 Pro is my favorite camera phone of the year, and although it isn't the Ultra, it delivers truly outstanding photos and videos in any situation. I like what Vivo is doing with its camera tuning; the brand has a clear advantage over its Chinese rivals in this area, and that is evident when using the X200 Pro next to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra and Magic 7 Pro.</p>

<p>The Find X8 Pro is almost as good, and I like the latest iteration of Hasselblad's image tuning algorithms. The phone has a quartet of 50MP cameras at the back, with dual tele lenses — one at 3x and the other at 6x — alongside a wide-angle and the main lens. The X200 Pro has a single tele lens, but it is using the new 200MP Samsung HP9 module, and it is incredible.</p>

<p>Both devices excel in challenging situations, and there really isn't much to critique when it comes to the resultant imagery. They both do a standout job with still photos and videos, and the X200 Pro in particular takes gorgeous portrait shots via the tele lens. Notably, both phones hold their own against the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and I'm excited to see what the Find X8 Ultra and Vivo X200 Ultra have to deliver later this year.</p>

<p>Just like the internals, there isn't much to differentiate either device on the software side of things. They both run <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> out of the box, and have customized skins that should be familiar if you've used either brand's devices in the past. I don't quite like the visual changes in ColorOS 15, and it is getting a bit too similar to iOS. <br><br>If anything, I like Funtouch OS better; while it still has overt styling, it is fluid, and there's extensive customizability. Both devices will get four Android OS updates, and while that isn't as much as what Google, Samsung and Honor deliver, it should be adequate.</p>

<p>I used the Find X8 Pro and Vivo X200 Pro extensively at the end of 2024 and over the course of 2025, and they share a lot of similarities: they both have excellent cameras, great battery life, standout hardware, and software with plenty of customizability. Choosing between the two is a matter of preference; the X200 Pro does a better job with portrait shots, and the Find X8 Pro has better software features. <br><br>I enjoyed using the X200 Pro more in general; the design is better than the Find X8 Pro, the panel gets brighter, and the battery lasts a little longer. Both phones take great photos, but the new 200MP tele lens gives the X200 Pro an edge, and I like Vivo's camera tuning better. If I had to pick a winner, the X200 Pro gets my vote. <br><br>That said, the phone isn't available outside Asia, so if you're in the U.K. or need to use one of these devices in the west, the Find X8 Pro is the obvious choice as OPPO is back to selling phones in the region. But if you're in a country where the X200 Pro is available, I'd suggest picking it up — it is better than anything Google and Samsung have to offer, and you'll need to use the cameras to understand just how amazing it is.</p>

<ul><li>Several strings of codes showcase that notification summaries could be making their way to us with Android 16.</li><li>This will be showcased as a new page under the notifications option in Settings.</li><li>The new OS could have the capability to summarize only conversations, not notifications from other non-messaging apps.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 16 Beta 3 just rolled out yesterday, while not many features were announced with this Beta, Google says Android 16 has reached "Platform stability."</p><p>Additionally, it seems like another important feature could be in the works. A deep dive into the third beta revealed several strings of code that showcased "summarized notifications," a feature that Google is working on bringing with Android 16 (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-notification-summaries-3533720/">as first spotted by Android Authority</a>).</p><p>This feature will "automatically summarize conversation on apps," the publication added. Ring a bell? Apple has a similar feature that debuted with Apple Intelligence, but it didn't go the way it was supposed to. It provided<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2024/11/apple-intelligence-notification-summaries-are-honestly-pretty-bad/"> "Bizarre summaries," </a>leading Apple to pause this feature until further notice.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1536px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C4pSK9o6bnCVTT6ucXUej8" name="Notification_summaries_in_Android_16" alt="Notifications summaries page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C4pSK9o6bnCVTT6ucXUej8.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1536" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The strings within the third Beta showcased a new page for notification summaries. This will be housed in the existing notification history with the notification bundle options under <strong>Settings > Notifications</strong>, the publication further added. Within the page, you can toggle to enable the feature, labeled “<strong>use notification summaries</strong>.” The subsequent code string also mentions Conversation summaries, which isn't a new concept for Android users.</p><p>What's more interesting is that you can also pick which apps will use this feature and probably exclude the ones that you don't need it for. However, this could also mean that the new OS will have the capability to summarize only conversations, not notifications from other non-messaging apps." We've seen something similar with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/heres-how-android-autos-message-summary-feature-shortens-texts-with-ai">Android Auto</a>, which can use artificial intelligence to create summaries for longer messages.</p><p>The publication further notes that these summaries could use the Android System Intelligence app, rather than Gemini to help with this feature. That said, it seems like an exciting feature to look forward to, as the public launch for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">Android 16</a> is closing in.</p>

We like the 2024 version of this phone a lot, especially for the 120Hz, 6.7-inch pOLED screen, the vegan leather backing, long battery life, and, of course, the inclusion of a built-in stylus. At this extra-low price point, this phone also punches well above its weight, featuring smooth, quick performance, and a generally more premium feel than most of what you can get for under $300.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a phone that comes with a stylus; you're looking for something with a large, bright display that has a high refresh rate; battery life is a major selling point for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're in need of a smartphone with more than one OS upgrade; you aren't looking for a phone with a stylus; you want something that rings in at an even lower price point.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G</a> is a great stylus smartphone, boasting a good-looking, 6.7-inch pOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate, a nice vegan leather backing, and of course, a stylus.</p><p>This phone comes pre-loaded with Android 14, and while it prices into the mid-range category, it almost feels like a premium phone. Smooth performance is backed by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 and 8GB of RAM, and this particular deal is for the upgraded 256GB storage option.</p><p>It also sports fast charging speeds with 30W wired connection or 15W wireless, and the 5,000mAH battery makes it easy to get through a full day on one charge.</p><p>To be sure, many were hoping to see stylus improvements between the 2023 and 2024 Moto G Stylus models, although Motorola didn't do anything different for this generation. Another downside to this phone is that it only comes with one OS upgrade, which could be a dealbreaker for many.</p><p>Still, with $150 off the price tag, this could be a good time to pick up the Moto G Stylus, even if you don't consider it to be your "forever phone."</p>

<p>CUKTECH isn't a name I've heard of before, but the brand's hefty battery pack put it on my radar. The recently released CUKTECH 30 140W Power Bank packs a whopping 40,000mAh of power and a total power output of 300W.</p><p>The CUKTECH 30 is ideal for long drives but not trips over the air, since you can't carry power banks over 20,000mAh inside most airlines. You wouldn't want to lug such a weighty battery around in a plane, so there's no love lost in that regard.</p><p>Speaking of weight, this thing is outrageously heavy for something "portable" that's meant to travel with you. Coming in at more than a kilo, it makes sense why CUKTECH decided to add a bucket-style handle to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-high-capacity-power-banks">high-capacity power bank</a>. The logistics of it require a handle at the very least.</p>

<p>The CUKTECH 30 is relatively compact for such a high capacity power station. You'll find four ports on the front of the cube as well as a Qi wireless charging pad on top, a digital display on the front, and a power button beneath the screen. The display showcases power input and output details as well as the battery percentage.</p><p>Here are the power ratings and other specifications of the 40,000mAh power bank.</p>

<p>Both USB-C ports support PowerDelivery 3.1 and can be used for power input as well as output. You can also charge the CUKTECH 30 itself while simultaneously using the power bank to top up other devices.</p><p>I love it when charging tech brands like Anker and UGREEN include a power distribution charge. This helps you understand the charging speed of each port depending on how many are in use and which ones.</p>

<p>CUKTECH provides four charts to simplify the matter, just like major competing brands, and I really appreciate it. As you can see above, the charts tell you exactly what charging speed can be achieved from each of the 40,000mAh power bank's ports.</p>
<p>Apart from the usual suspects, CUKTECH also went ahead and incorporated a huge cooling fan into the back of this cuboid battery pack. The power bank smartly regulates the temperature of the charging accessory, so it never runs too hot.</p>

<p>If you know anything about chargers and cables, you'll know that charging over 100W requires a 5A cable, also known as an e-marked cable. CUKTECH provides a 5A 240W <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB-C cable</a> in the box along with the battery pack, so you don't need to buy one in case you don't already own it.</p><p>The CUKTECH 30 is very handy for road trips and long-haul journeys. No matter how long your car charger's cable, having a separate power source in the back eliminates that tangled web of wires extending to the back. With such a large capacity, you can charge a 5,000mAh phone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> a whopping <strong>eight times</strong>!</p><p>Ultimately, the CUKTECH 30 140W Power Bank is an all-inclusive purchase. The brand uses vehicle-grade batteries, so it's extremely safe to transport in your automobile. And, if you're getting robbed, you could kill the perpetrator by lobbing it at their noggin (just kidding, please don't try this at home).</p>

<hr>
<p>Today (Mar. 14), reports announce Apple will move forward with a security improvement for its RCS messaging with Android devices.</p><p>It was announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/article/rcs-encryption-a-leap-towards-secure-and-interoperable-messaging/">GSMA press release</a> that the RCS standard will soon roll out E2EE (end-to-end encryption) measures for RCS messages (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/629620/apple-iphone-e2ee-encryption-rcs-messaging-android">The Verge</a>). GSMA's technical director, Tom Van Pelt, states this update will ensure that messages and files, such as those you'd like to remain confidential, stay secure between the parties involved in the messaging instance.</p><p>Van Pelt adds this update means the RCS standard will be "the first large-scale messaging service to support interoperable E2EE between client implementations from different providers."</p><p>GSMA says its RCS Universal Profile 3.0 update will not only bring more security to users' messages but also protections against instances of fraud and scams. The Association states it will "continue to support" functions between iOS and Android, like group messaging, high-resolution media sharing, read receipts, and typing indicators.</p><p>However, this update means Apple's iPhones should finally have encrypted texts between them and Android. In a statement to The Verge, Shane Bauer, an Apple spokesperson, informed the publication that it will "add support for end-to-end encrypted RCS messages to iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and watchOS in future software updates.”</p>

<p>Apple is said to have been a strong advocate for E2EE in RCS alongside GSMA's work with "mobile operators, device manufacturers, and technology providers." The company even stated it has "helped lead a cross-industry effort to bring end-to-end encryption to the RCS Universal Profile," per The Verge.</p><p>There's a long history <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">of Google campaigning</a> for Apple to bring RCS support so Android can better communicate with iPhone owners. When an EU investigation into whether or not Apple's iMessage fell within "Gatekeeper" status, the company went ahead and announced it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-announces-rcs-support-coming-to-iphone">would bring RCS anyway</a>.</p><p>iOS 18 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">brought RCS support</a> between iPhones and Android nearly a year later. The update improved media sharing between users and most of what the GSMA discussed in its press release. However, the rollout lacked something substantial: encryption. What's of importance is that the RCS standard never <em>actually </em>had E2EE wrapped inside. It was Google that decided to add that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-will-now-directly-offer-rcs-features-instead-waiting-carriers">strong level of encryption</a> for user messages.</p><p>When Apple worked to bring RCS, it didn't choose to work on encryption itself — and it surely didn't collaborate with Google to do it. Instead, we've got its collaboration with the GSM Association, as well as other companies to bring E2EE to the RCS standard as a whole.</p><p>Apple is set to bring the security measure to its iOS users soon, but how soon is still up in the air.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out a new patch for the Find My Device app that brings a new "People" tab beside "Devices."</li><li>The tab lets users quickly share their location, similar to Google Maps, with contacts, showing battery percentage and name.</li><li>Google highlighted such a feature during its March feature drop announcement and it's finally starting to appear for Android users two weeks later.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's Find My Device is picking up a couple of updates to end the week, but the most important is starting as test users can get in on.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/13/find-my-device-people-update/#more-665109">9to5Google</a>, the company is currently pushing update v3.1.277-4 of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">Find My Device</a> today (Mar 14). The core of this patch is the new "People" tab, which is a new location-sharing feature that users can try out. Nestled right beside the "Devices" tab at the bottom of the UI, users can quickly add someone they'd like to share their location with.</p><p>The UI to add someone shows an "in-app sharing" container. From there, users can tap someone they know or search for them if the app didn't make them readily available. However, above that, users will see a small card of what the other person will see once you've shared your location. It seems Google is making your profile icon, name, location (of course), and battery available to the person you've shared with.</p><p>Users can go about sharing their location by tapping the share button or grabbing a share link. Additionally, you can decide how long you'd like that other person to see your location. The publication states Google gives users the following options: one hour, "Today Only," "Until you turn this off," or a custom duration.</p><p>Google's People tab is powered by Maps, which makes sense considering it's extremely similar to what you'd find over there. More importantly, the People tab has a "beta" tag right beside it. It's likely Google is still working through issues and will continue to improve upon it as users deliver feedback.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:264px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:227.27%;"><img id="j7fakYtZhxxT2efJ4HTnyk" name="google-find-my-device-people-tab-location-sharing" alt="Google's latest Find My Device update brings a new "People" tab for location sharing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j7fakYtZhxxT2efJ4HTnyk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="264" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The update is rolling out, so users should begin seeing it today and in the days ahead. It also contains one minor change to the "Devices" tab, which produces it in a split-screen view, instead of a full page. Now, users can still see their devices on the map while browsing their inventory.</p><p>Google first brought attention to this "People" tab update during the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March feature drop</a> for Pixels almost two weeks ago. The company stated users can share where they are with "trusted contacts," and that point can be viewed on a map on their phone or tablet. All Android users <em>should </em>see this update, though.</p><p>Google started pushing its Find My Device network out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-more-people-devices-rollout">to more users and devices</a> in May 2024. Those in the U.S., U.K., and Japan were among the first to start noticing its features. Users can leverage the Find My Device network to relocate missing items like their phones and accessories, such as earbuds. Unlike most other phones, Google's Pixel 8 — and the Pixel 9 — benefit from its offline discovery mode, which lets you relocate the phones if they've lost power or have been shut down.</p><p>The Find My Device network will also alert you to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-security-safety-improvements">an unwanted tracker</a> you didn't know was on you.</p>

<ul><li>Google announced that it will be upgrading Google Assistant with Gemini "in the coming months."</li><li>By the end of this year, people will not be able to download Google Assistant from app stores as it will be discontinued.</li><li>Google has not mentioned any details as to when this upgrade will begin and which devices will start seeing the change first.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Assistant is running on borrowed time as the tech giant announced today (Mar. 14) that it will slowly start replacing Google Assistant with Gemini. Google Assistant has been around since 2016, and we've all gotten used to saying "Hey Google" for a better part of a decade now.  However, this switch is something that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant-becomes-gemini-but-only-in-certain-countries">has been on the cards</a> for several months now.<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/looks-like-a-new-wake-word-could-be-replacing-hey-google"> Recent rumors</a> even indicated a new wake word in the works, so it feels like we did see this coming.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/google-assistant-gemini-mobile/">Keyword post</a>, the company stated that they will be upgrading Google Assistant with Gemini, "offering a new kind of help only possible with the power of AI." The upgrade is said to take personalization to a whole new level since Gemini will be able to interact with other apps on the phone to understand the user's choices better.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EWLShJgsJzLc7eMRMsUDh" name="Gemini-Live-S25" alt="Gemini Live on the Samsung Galaxy S25." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EWLShJgsJzLc7eMRMsUDh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google says that millions of users have switched from using Google Assistant to Gemini. That said, no longer having to choose between Gemini and Assistant could be a step in the right direction, especially as Google has been working to improve Gemini's capabilities and bring over Assistant features.</p><p>While we don't know when this will be put into motion for users at large, the company hinted at the fact that most devices will end up having Gemini instead of Google Assistant by the end of 2025.</p><p>"Over the coming months, we’re upgrading more users on mobile devices from Google Assistant to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/assistant/" target="_blank">Gemini</a>," the company stated in the Keyword. With that, later this year, users will no longer be able to download Google Assistant from their mobile app stores since it will no longer be accessible.</p><p>Not just phones but all the other devices that use Assistant will also be upgraded to AI-powered Gemini. The company will be bringing this shift to its line of wearables and home devices like headphones, watches,  speakers, and TVs. We assume that this will be rolled out in phases over the next few months, until then Google Assistant will continue to live on devices and run as usual.</p><p>Lastly, Google says that "it is just getting started" with this Gemini integration. Once Gemini replaces Assistant, the company will bring features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/made-by-google-gemini-ai-updates/">Gemini Live and </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research/?hl=en" target="_blank">Deep Research</a>, which will help transform Gemini into "a personal research assistant."</p><p>However, it is important to note that Google Assistant will continue to work as usual for phones that can't run Gemini.</p>

<hr>
<p>More issues arise for Google's products as users begin reporting problems with an older streaming device.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/13/chromecast-google-tv-android-14-update-problems/">9to5Google</a> highlights a surge of user reports, stating their Chromecast with Google TV is suffering issues following its (late) Android 14 update. Users on the AndroidTV <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1ja7tr4/android_14_update_rolling_out_to_chromecast_with/">subreddit</a> started discussing the update — and the problems that have surfaced. One user claims that while their Chromecast "didn't brick" they did encounter one frustrating problem: no sound.</p><p>The user says they were forced to restart their device "several times" before they regained audio. What's more, the report adds they're unable to "set up advanced display settings or anything. Settings just vanish while scrolling."</p><p>Other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1ja7tr4/comment/mhm6p7s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">users chimed in</a>, stating the Android 14 update for the Chromecast with Google TV caused severe problems with external storage. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1ja7tr4/comment/mhkm7lw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report</a> said the same and that their device "won't recognize" their storage drive. Aside from these problems, one user claims, after updating, their Chromecast remote isn't working as it did previously.</p><p>Google has yet to highlight these issues plaguing users following the Chromecast's long-awaited Android 14 update. In the meantime, for those who are affected by any problems, users on Reddit have found one band aid fix: factory resetting the device.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV/comments/1ja7tr4/android_14_update_rolling_out_to_chromecast_with">Android 14 update rolling out to Chromecast with Google TV</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidTV">r/AndroidTV</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>As the publication reiterates, Chromecast with Google TV users are finally receiving the company's expected Android 14 — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-working-on-major-android-14-update-for-chromecast-with-4k">almost a year later</a>. A company representative stated the update would be a "significant" update to the device, considering it was still rocking Android 12 until this week. Google made it clear that the Chromecast will not receive one feature: the ability to connect to the Thread border router.</p><p>That will remain exclusive to the Google TV Streamer as, if you remember, the Chromecast with Google TV was discontinued last year. With that in mind, this Android 14 update is the final major OS patch users can expect from Google. However, the Chromecast with Google TV HD variant will continue to see security updates through 2017.</p><p>The 4K version only lasts until September 2025.</p><p>Speaking of the TV Streamer, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tv-streamer-update-seemingly-kills-dolby-truehd-dts-hd-formats-for-good">rolled out an update</a> in February that killed its Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD formats. These options weren't accessible by users; however, they were detectable by the Streamer. Meanwhile, the box's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/the-first-google-tv-streamer-update-lets-you-manually-choose-an-audio-output-format">very first</a> update let users select their most preferred audio format from the following selection: Dolby Digital Plus, Dolby Digital, or PCM Stereo.</p>

<p>As the days go by and my beard gets gray, I also seem to accumulate more ways to store my digital things. I have more hard drives, SSDs, and microSD cards than I can keep track of. While it's nothing compared to what my colleague and Android Central senior editor Harish Jonnalagadda has, it's still enough to make my head spin.</p><p>Part of the problem is that I've become a digital hoarder, but I didn't always use to be like this. It ended up happening after I started getting deeper into emulation, only to find myself left scouring the web for traces of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/nintendo-stikes-major-blow-android-emulators">Yuzu and Ryujinx</a> after Nintendo came knocking. It's not just limited to emulators, as I also have backups of backups (of backups) for my collection of games, both retro and modern.</p><p>But my need for more storage has started to become a problem when it comes to using my favorite Android phones, and here's why.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP" name="galaxy-s24-ultra-microsd-card-5.jpg" alt="MicroSD card on the back of the Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rrys54xP3wbYapWD4JQtnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Once upon a time, I would leave most of my files just on my phone, backing some things up to the cloud and transferring everything else when I got a new one. However, one tiny loophole in the mix was being able to keep all of the files that I cared about on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a>. Then, I could just pop it out of my old phone into the new one and be ready to go without skipping a beat.</p><p>Slowly but surely, many companies started following in Apple's footsteps, removing the microSD card slot. The reasons for the decision being made varied from company to company. These ranged from fear-mongering over potential data loss to microSD cards just not being quite fast enough. Oh, and my favorite, "There's not enough space."</p><p>All malarkey.</p><p>There was a point in time when I took a company's word at face value. Thankfully, I've mostly) grown out of being that naive, so I have a pretty good idea that it has nothing to do with anything other than money.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I miss the days of being able to pop my microSD card out of one phone and popping right into a new one. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>If a company ships a phone with different storage tiers but <em>also</em> includes a microSD card slot, most will probably opt for the cheapest of the tiers. Then, they'll either buy a new microSD card or they'll just re-use the one they already have. That's a problem for these companies because they can't extract more money from your wallet. So, instead, we're left paying more money at ridiculous margins just so that we have enough storage.</p><p>As I mentioned before, none of this used to bother me. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">Retro emulation</a> is only one of the reasons why it annoys the ever-living you-know-what out of me now. The other reason is that I'm now a dad, which means taking boatloads of pictures and videos of the little one as he grows like a weed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR" name="ps3-on-android-1" alt="Rayman on Pocket EVO with aPS3e on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9CNzMjcBt4AktGg2WqhbR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>By themselves, ROM file sizes can get pretty darn huge, especially now that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/whats-going-on-with-ps3-for-android-emulation">PS3 emulation</a> on Android is seemingly taking off. Combine that with taking a bunch of pictures and recording video, and before you know it, you don't have enough space to install an update.</p><p>Yes, I'm fully aware that I can back everything up, and I do, but I also live in a semi-rural area with pockets of spotty cell service. It's beyond annoying and frustrating when I'm out golfing with some buddies from out of town, and ask to see pictures, only to end up not being able to because everything's in the cloud.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Cloud storage is great until you don't have enough cell service to show off pictures of your son to your golfing buddies. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So, what other options do I have left? Well, as it turns out, there are a few. If a company isn't going to include expandable storage, I'll just do it myself.</p><p>Earlier, I mentioned that I've become a storage hoarder, but it's not just with stocking up on hard drives for my desktop or NAS. I've also, for lack of a better phrase, started collecting portable SSDs of various shapes and sizes. These include some from Samsung, Crucial, and SanDisk, and I even have a nifty NVMe enclosure from ASUS.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Bmq2R7TwDSzthaGcKC9XkY" name="various-external-storage-devices" alt="A variety of external storage solutions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bmq2R7TwDSzthaGcKC9XkY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, those still are a bit too big to use comfortably, not to mention that they can basically just end up dangling at the end of your phone. However, seeing as I'm a huge advocate for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe</a>, I was intrigued by some of the portable SSDs that just snap onto the back of a compatible phone or case.</p><p>So, after having a quick conversation with Harish to get his thoughts, he suggested I check out what ORICO has to offer. As it turns out, the ORICO K20 Mini has turned out to be <em>exactly</em> what I was looking for. It's super small and lightweight, has fast transfer speeds, can come with up to 2TB of storage, and, most importantly, can attach magnetically to my phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bH5T75dmh4Y5hjKoCzsmmY" name="orico-k20-mini-1" alt="ORICO K20 Mini with included cable and MagSafe adapter" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bH5T75dmh4Y5hjKoCzsmmY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ORICO includes a magnetic ring in the box, which I promptly put on the back of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-a-mobile-gaming-beast-and-it-just-scored-its-first-major-discount-at-amazon">RedMagic 10 Pro</a> case. Just about every other phone in my arsenal is already equipped with a Fiberborne case which has MagSafe built-in. Even still, I didn't actually expect to find an attachment in the box.</p><p>For the most part, this has solved my growing annoyance with the lack of a microSD card on my various devices. I've put a bunch of the larger games on there, including Switch, PS3, and x86 games for Winlator. And with the 2TB model, I still have plenty of space for if I want to add more, or if I need a quick and easy way to transfer anything else.</p><p>I say "for the most part" because ultimately, it's still an inconvenience. Since it has to be plugged in whenever I want to fire up some emulation, it introduces other limitations. For example, I can't use certain phone controllers like the Razer Kishi Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-galileo-review">GameSir G8 Galileo</a>, since those connect via the USB-C port.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="yzTgx7AwzvwSvAaAT848kY" name="redmagic-10-pro-with-orico-k20-mini-gamesir-g8-galileo-razer-kishi-ultra-1" alt="ORICO K20 Mini connected to RedMagic 10 Pro compared to GameSir G8 Galileo and Razer Kishi Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yzTgx7AwzvwSvAaAT848kY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>However, even with other controllers like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/gamesir-g8-plus-review">GameSir G8 Plus</a>, there was still another problem, albeit a solvable one. ORICO includes a short USB-C to USB-C cable, but that won't work when using a detachable controller. So, instead, I had to dig in my bottomless pit of cables and dongles to find either a right-angle cable or an adapter. Thankfully, my cable hoarding came in the clutch, as I found both.</p><p>Trust me, it's not something that leaves me feeling very confident, but hey, it'll work for now. Then there's another problem, which, again, can be solved as long as you're okay with more compromise.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="HZt9eYsyD7zDgc6U5LokhY" name="redmagic-10-pro-with-orico-k20-mini-gamesir-g8-plus" alt="ORICO K20 Mini connected to RedMagic 10 Pro using the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HZt9eYsyD7zDgc6U5LokhY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What happens if I need to charge my phone while I'm playing? Well, you had better hope that it's not like the RedMagic 10 Pro or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember" target="_blank">OnePlus Open</a>, which lack wireless charging. Otherwise, I guess your next best bet is to create some kind of over-engineered docking solution so that you can use the K20 Mini and keep your phone charged at the same time.</p><p>Ultimately, it just underlines the original problem even more since you'll jump through a bunch of hoops. But these are the cards we've been dealt, and last time I checked, OEMs don't really care all that much when there's more money to be made.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is rumored to be interested in plugging "variable aperture" into the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</li><li>Rumors about the aperture range remain unknown; however, Xiaomi recently did this, delivering an f/1.63 to f/4.0 range on the 14 Ultra.</li><li>Previous rumors claim Samsung is working on 200MP telephoto tech with a 1/1.5-inch sensor.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Interest around Samsung's next smartphone series continues as new rumors suggest a major camera addition.</p><p>Rumors this time around stem from an Ice Universe <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5673255066/PieNS372I">Weibo post</a>, which claims Samsung could provide a "variable aperture" on the next flagship Galaxy (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-camera-variable-aperture-rumor/">SamMobile</a>). The tipster purports this camera addition could arrive on the Galaxy S26 Ultra. Unfortunately, the rumors don't expand much about the range of aperture we could see <em>if </em>this proves true.</p><p>Ice Universe went into more detail in the comments with users, with one post stating the variable aperture could land on its primary lens.</p><p>Additionally, the tipster claims in a separate response that the S26 Ultra's primary lens will "significantly improve night scenes and HDR." The smaller an aperture is (take f/1.8 for example), the more light can hit your camera's sensor. Typically, you'd use this in scenarios where there isn't enough natural light, so you can see your subjects clearer.</p><p>Perhaps, with that, we can pretend Samsung will deliver one aperture setting that's quite low to cover low-light and another that's better for the middle game. But it's still extremely early and things can always change.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Variable aperture in Samsung Galaxy S26 ultra main Cam.#Samsung #GalaxyS26Ultra https://t.co/wv6E4YukO5 pic.twitter.com/l8Uf5myo9z<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1899825429856567358">March 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>It's worth highlighting that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s9-review">Galaxy S9</a> feature variable aperture for its primary lens, as noted by SamMobile. The device could swap between a f/1.5 and f/2.4.</p><p>If you're thinking more current day, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-launch-and-14-ultra">Xiaomi's 14 Ultra</a> features variable aperture with its primary lens. The phone launched in February with an aperture range of f/1.63 to f/4.0. While Samsung's version with the S9 was known more as "dual-aperture," Xiaomi's version truly delivers variation as users can gradually climb (or descend) through their aperture levels.</p><p>In short, it gives the consumer a little more agency with their photos and the look as a lower number affects the depth of field. Xiaomi provided this aperture variation on a one-inch sensor, the Sony LYT-900 (50MP).</p><p>The tipster on Weibo claims Samsung will continue to provide the same camera "solution," which could indicate a 200MP sensor. However, Samsung was previously rumored to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-200mp-periscope-telephoto-development-rumored">a 200MP telephoto lens</a> in the works. The Korean OEM is supposedly working to craft a 1/1.5-inch sensor for this lens. Extra details remain unknown, but there's speculation the Galaxy S26 Ultra could grab this — and maybe with Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-telephoto-camera-module-alop-detailed">ALoP tech</a>, too.</p>

<h2 id="visible-vs-mint-mobile-which-pixel-9-deal-is-better-2">Visible vs. Mint Mobile: which Pixel 9 deal is better?</h2>
<p>I'll start by saying that both of these deals are pretty remarkable. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile's offers</a> are noteworthy due to the sheer amount of cash you can save by paying for a year of the Unlimited plan in advance. </p><p>You're looking at one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> on the market AND 12 months of wireless for significantly less than it would cost to buy the phone unlocked from Best Buy or Amazon. Mint Mobile's Unlimited plan is no slouch either: for what amounts to $15 per month, you're getting unlimited talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's vast network, plus a mobile hotspot, Wi-Fi calling, and free calls to Mexico and Canada. </p><p>That being said, if you don't mind paying a little more for a premium wireless experience, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-review">Visible</a> might be the better option here. Priced at $395 for a year (about $33 per month) the Visible Plus plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon's legendary 5G Ultra Wideband network, plus HD streaming, 50GB of premium data every month, and a bounty of international benefits that you'd usually expect to get from a Big Three carrier. Just be sure to use that <strong>code SWEETDEAL</strong> during checkout if you want the 50% discount on the Google Pixel 9.</p><p>Needless to say, if you simply can't choose between the two carriers, check out our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/visible-vs-mint-mobile">Visible vs. Mint Mobile guide</a> for a more comprehensive look. </p>

<p>Looking at pure dollars and cents, buying the Google Pixel 9 and one year of wireless from <strong>Visible will set you back $794</strong>, while Mint Mobile's identical bundle will cost <strong>around $579, </strong>making Mint the more cost-effective choice. Is it worth it to pay that extra $215 to get 5G Ultra Wideband, international benefits, and more? It's totally up to you, but I'd argue that you're getting a great deal either way. </p><p>On a final and perhaps less-important note, it might be worth mentioning that Visible still has the Google Pixel 9 in its Obsidian, Wintergreen, and Peony color variants, while Mint Mobile only has Obsidian in stock.

There's also the fact that you don't get a visible cutout at the front, and that makes it immersive like no other device around. Combine that with powerful hardware, great battery life, and clean software without any bloat, and you have a great gaming phone. The cameras aren't anywhere as good as other high-end phones, and if that's a consideration, you should just get the OnePlus 13. </p></p>

<p>You won't find two devices that look as different; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nubia-z70-ultra-review">Z70 Ultra</a> has a blocky design and feels like a brick, and although OnePlus also switched to flat sides this year, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> includes beveled edges and rounded corners, and it is significantly easier to hold and use. Both devices have huge batteries, but the OnePlus 13 is lighter by 18g, and it is noticeable when using both phones next to one another.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FxZcmFdHV4LVRypC2gQmRV" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FxZcmFdHV4LVRypC2gQmRV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the design of the OnePlus 13 quite a bit, and the blue model in particular with the vegan leather texture is terrific. It has a soft texture and doesn't pick up any smudges, and it makes using the phone that much more enjoyable. The polished sides contrast the blue really well, and the in-hand feel is excellent. The camera island also looks cleaner this year, and the overall design is cohesive.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="uL8pneuNsXpY2NguyvVABJ" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uL8pneuNsXpY2NguyvVABJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With the Z70 Ultra, it's clear that Nubia wanted to make a statement. The phone isn't as comfortable to hold thanks to the flat sides, and it is heavy at 228g. The camera island at the back is ginormous, but I will say this — it has a better design than last year, and doesn't look quite as cluttered.</p>

<p>Both devices get IP68 and IP69 dust and water resistance, and there isn't any issue using the phones at the pool or in the shower. Nubia added a dedicated camera shutter button on the right of the Z70 Ultra, and the left side has a slider that's akin to the alert slider on the OnePlus 13. Of these two devices, there's no question that I like the design of the OnePlus 13 better; it just feels elegant and has a better in-hand feel.</p>
<h2 id="nubia-z70-ultra-vs-oneplus-13-display-2">Nubia Z70 Ultra vs. OnePlus 13: Display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="v9J96faB7YPhA9werxsvXV" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v9J96faB7YPhA9werxsvXV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Z70 Ultra has a 6.85-inch AMOLED panel with 144Hz refresh, with the OnePlus 13 getting a 6.82-inch panel with the usual 120Hz refresh. Although the Z70 Ultra has a marginally bigger panel, the OnePlus 13 has higher resolution, and it gets brighter in regular use. I also like the colors on the OnePlus 13 a little better than the Z70 Ultra, and the phone has better customizability when it comes to adjusting the color balance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RLE7Bhq4AJguPX8H34q2WV" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RLE7Bhq4AJguPX8H34q2WV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the biggest advantage with the Z70 Ultra is that there's no visible selfie camera cutout. Nubia uses an under-screen camera module, and the result is that you get an immersive panel that's ideally suited to consume multimedia and game. It is a big enough differentiator that I'd suggest getting the device if you don't like the camera cutout that's standard on every other phone today.</p>

<p>Other than that, there isn't much to talk about. Both phones have decent stereo sound and do a good job with HDR content, and there aren't any issues with content playback as such. Although the OnePlus 13 technically has a better AMOLED panel, I'm giving this one to the Z70 Ultra because of its uniqueness.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="YcNpKiys572Uw5Co3GbDRV" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YcNpKiys572Uw5Co3GbDRV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There really isn't much to differentiate either phone with the hardware. Both devices use the same Qualcomm silicon, and they do an amazing job in daily use as well as gaming. The Z70 Ultra gets noticeably hotter — it is the hottest phone I tested in 2025 — and it is evident during extended gaming sessions. That said, there are absolutely no issues with throttling, and although it isn't billed as one, it doubles as a terrific gaming phone. <br><br>The only limitation with the OnePlus 13 is that it doesn't allow high refresh gaming. OxygenOS 15 still enforces a 60fps setting, and while you get three games that technically go up to 120fps, it isn't enough. There is noticeable throttling after the 30-minute mark, but it doesn't affect visuals too much.</p>

<p>Both devices have base models that come with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, and have similar connectivity. There's also high-res audio codecs as standard, and I like the vibration motor on the OnePlus 13; it has exquisite feedback, and you can easily tell the difference when using the keyboard and navigating the interface. <br><br>Things are equitable with the battery as well; the Z70 Ultra has a massive 6150mAh battery, and I only needed to charge the device every day and a half on average. The OnePlus 13 has a 6000mAh battery, and it only lasts a day and a half. Both devices use silicon batteries and have fast charging tech, taking under 50 minutes to fully charge.</p>

<p>I'm not going to talk too much about the cameras as the OnePlus 13 has an outsized lead in this regard. The Z70 Ultra takes good photos, but the image quality isn't as consistent as the OnePlus 13, and the auxiliary lenses don't measure up. It's still a good choice if you need usable cameras and don't intend to take too many photos and videos, but if camera quality is a key consideration, you should get the OnePlus 13. <br><br>The Z70 Ultra has good camera modules, with a 50MP main lens alongside a 64MP tele with 2.7x optical zoom, and a 50MP wide-angle. I'll give Nubia this; it did a much better job with the cameras this year, and while the Z70 Ultra may not be on the same level as the OnePlus 13, it does a good job in its own right.</p>
<p>Coming to the OnePlus 13, the device manages to take outstanding photos and videos. Hasselblad's color tuning delivers vibrant photos without too much saturation, and it handles low-light scenarios incredibly well. There isn't much to fault with the cameras, and the only thing I'll point out is that the device sits one tier below the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> — these two phones are something else entirely.</p>

<p>I'm conflicted when it comes to the software on these phones. The Z70 Ultra has a cleaner interface that's similar to vanilla Android, and there's no bloatware whatsoever. The interface is fluid as well, and only ASUS's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> has better fluidity. However, the overall polish isn't quite as good as what you get with other mainstream devices, and Nubia needs to add a little bit of customizability to the interface to make it stand out. <br><br>The OnePlus 13 has overt styling, and while OxygenOS 15 has a cleaner design, it somehow ends up looking like iOS. That's down to the split notification pane and changes to the visual design, and while the phone has standout fluidity and extensive customization, I don't like using it as much. That said, it doesn't have any of the bugs that plagued the interface in previous years.</p>
<p>OxygenOS 15 also has better utilities that leverage machine learning, and the image editing tools do a good job. Ultimately, both software skins have their own plus points; I like the clean and uncluttered design of the Z70 Ultra, and the OnePlus 13 has tons of extra features that you'll actually end up using. <br><br>When it comes to updates, however, the OnePlus 13 has a clear advantage. The phone will get four guaranteed Android OS platform updates alongside five years of security updates, whereas the Z70 Ultra will get three platform updates and four years of security updates. Nubia isn't quick to roll out updates either, so there will be a wait before the phone switches over to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="JZaprc6kzBsx9Bx39SPJTV" name="Nubia Z70 Ultra vs OnePlus 13" alt="Nubia Z70 Ultra next to OnePlus 13 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JZaprc6kzBsx9Bx39SPJTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The base 12GB/256GB model of the Nubia Z70 Ultra can be bought for as low as $699 as of writing, and that is a fantastic deal when you consider the caliber of the hardware you're getting. The design is a bit unwieldy, and the device is heavier than most other 2025 phones. That said, you get a massive battery that lasts a day and a half, the hardware is outstanding, and thanks to the unique AMOLED panel without a cutout, gaming and streaming content is immersive. <br><br>The biggest issue with the Z70 Ultra is that the cameras aren't anywhere as good as traditional flagships. While the main camera is decent enough, the resultant shots don't have the same detail, and you miss out on the versatility that defines the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. Similarly, the software lacks refinement, and while you get a clean interface without any bloat, there isn't much in the way of customizability. If that isn't an issue and you need the latest hardware without paying too much cash, the Z70 Ultra gets my recommendation. <br><br>The OnePlus 13 is the costlier choice by a lot, with the 12GB/256GB model coming in at $899. But you also get terrific cameras, a better design, brighter AMOLED panel, and the same great internal hardware. The software isn't as clean, but you get extensive customizability, and more software updates. The cameras hold their own against the best that Google and Samsung have to offer, and that alone makes the OnePlus 13 a standout choice. You'll need to pay more, but you're also getting a better overall device.</p>

<hr>
<p>Meta seems to be taking varied perspectives seriously as it announced today (Mar. 13) that it has begun testing out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-removes-option-to-report-misleading-information">Community Notes</a>, similar to what X does on its platform.</p><p>With this feature, users would add more context about a certain topic as contributors on that platform. This will replace the now active third-party fact-checking feature on all of its apps. However, like X, users would first have to sign up to be contributors for this feature. These contributors will be allowed to write and rate notes on content across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads.</p><p>"Around 200,000 potential contributors in the US have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.meta.com/technologies/community-notes?utm_medium=vanity&utm_source=meta.me-cn">signed up</a> so far across all three apps, and the waitlist remains open for those who wish to take part in the program," Meta explained in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/03/testing-begins-community-notes-facebook-instagram-threads/">press release.</a></p><p>The presser added that it will initially use X's open-source algorithm and build on it for Meta's platforms.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZzMzkyMpvmFoiLqi23iKGL" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZzMzkyMpvmFoiLqi23iKGL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>To be a contributor, users need to be over 18, have an account that’s more than 6 months old, and be in good standing, meaning not flagged for misuse. Other than that, the profile should be two-factor authenticated as well.</p><p>As users start contributing, Meta says the author's names will remain anonymous to protect their privacy and show up as "People added a community note" under the said image/topic. Contributors will be able to submit notes on anything, including stuff posted by Meta, politicians, and other public figures. However, they won't be able to add to advertisements.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="xHn9Fe3Zs9CoHCdtiwpQUL" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xHn9Fe3Zs9CoHCdtiwpQUL.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for how it works, once contributors add their viewpoints on a certain topic limited to 500 characters, it won't be published on a post "unless contributors with a range of viewpoints broadly agree on them."</p><p>"No matter how many contributors agree on a note, it won’t be published unless people who normally disagree decide that it provides helpful context," the presser explained. Additionally, when community notes are added to a specific image/topic, it won't flag the post the way that fact-checking would.</p><p>Meta adds that these notes will not showcase the opinions of the company but will attempt to create a more unbiased platform for people to voice their opinions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:87.08%;"><img id="rpnTAevui8FPRFR9D2zbML" name="Meta-Community-Notes" alt="Community Notes on Meta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rpnTAevui8FPRFR9D2zbML.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1672" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Community Notes will be showcased in six different languages commonly used in the United States. This includes English, Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Portuguese, and other languages will be expanded over time. That said, this feature will first be tested out in the U.S. starting Mar. 18 and then be rolled out to a wider audience.</p>

<p>Google is reportedly testing out a new way to answer calls on its Phone app. It might be letting go of its usual sliding up and down motion to answer/reject calls to something that looks a lot like a blast from the past.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-incoming-call-ui-changes-apk-teardown-3534690/">APK teardown by Android Authority</a> revealed as much when tested with a phone running on the Phone app's version <strong>v166.0.735169223</strong> beta, the publication added.</p><p>Google apparently wants to change things up with Android 16, and this could include the way we answer phones as well. But instead of bringing a new-looking UI, it seems like it's hitting us with some old-school memories.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hopXtUiQYy8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>As seen in the above video by the publication, it looks like we might be in for a more side-to-side gesture of picking up a call.  It features a pill-shaped bar at the bottom of the screen, with an icon in the center— which can be dragged to the left to decline and right to accept a call. Additionally, you also see a "Message" option above the pill-shaped bar, to send people a text if you choose to decline their calls.</p><p>While Google has stuck to the same UI for years, it would take some practice for the fingers to stop swiping up to pick up a phone call. It remains unclear when this feature will show up on the app itself.</p><p>However, if this change does occur, it can change the way people answer calls not just on Pixel devices but also on all other phones where the Google Phone app comes pre-loaded. This means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> from companies like Motorola, Sony, and others could be graced with the new UI.</p>

<p>Last year, the Google Phone app was<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-give-its-phone-app-a-fresh-coat-of-apple-inspired-paint" target="_blank"> testing out an Apple-like incoming call </a>screen where the accept call button would be staged on the right and the reject button on the left, unlike the other way around on most Samsung phones. This UI showcased color-coded buttons for the action, allowing it to be easily recognizable. While this shift looked promising, it was only being tested on a handful of devices and didn't see a wider rollout.</p><p>Similarly, this redesign could be in a small testing phase as well, but it remains unclear when or if we will ever see this shift in UI. However, to clarify things, Android Central has reached out to Google and will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for an affordable, entry-level Android phone with premium features, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a are two good options. Both come in at under $500 but have impressive specs that suggest they cost much more. Both employ beautiful designs and software and security support for years. But they are very different phones in terms of the look and what they have to offer that makes them stand out. So, let’s dive deeper into how they compare.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-google-pixel-8a-the-design-and-basic-features-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a: The design and basic features</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="QhWyBvRndrqc5KcRzgtce" name="nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-displays-holding-01" alt="Comparing the displays and sizes between the Nothing Phone (3a) and Phone (3a) Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QhWyBvRndrqc5KcRzgtce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro, which launched in early March 2025, looks like no other phone you have come across with a cool, transparent exterior design that is inspired by Japanese iconography. This includes clean, geometric shapes on a flat surface with straight sides. Nothing (pun intended) on the market looks like this phone, Nicholas Sutrich enthuses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">in his Nothing Phone 3a Pro review</a>.</p><p>Made of high-grade tempered glass with machined aluminum accents and a 6.77-inch 2,392 x 1,080 FHD+ AMOLED, you’ll get a decent 120Hz refresh rate for keeping up with everything from multitasking to gaming. There’s also an impressive up to 3,000 nits brightness, so the phone is viewable in just about any scenario, even direct sunlight.</p><p>The Glyph interface sets it apart. The purpose of this unique design is to help you avoid distractions by using light and sound patterns to indicate notifications and ringtones. Rather than constantly looking at your phone, a unique color and pattern of light will tell you who’s calling, for example, or what type of notification you’re getting. You can also leverage the Glyph interface for things like music playback, a camera timer, and volume.</p><p>Finished in black or grey, the Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 91.4% screen-to-body ratio and an Essential key on its side for taking screenshots, long pressing to record your voice, or double pressing to open Essential Space. This is a spot that organizes your content, like screenshots, voice notes, and text notes, into neat and logical categories for easy retrieval and action prompts. You can customize the look of widgets and use the smart drawer to automatically organize apps by category.</p><p>Equipped with a 5,000mAh battery, the Nothing Phone 3a can last all day: Sutrich says it even easily lasts beyond a day, up to two for light users. It supports 50W fast charging as well as 7.5W reverse wireless charging. It comes with either 128GB or 256GB non-expandable storage.</p><p>The phone boasts an IP64 rating, so it’s not quite as rugged as others, but Sutrich says it feels durable with a nice, grippy texture, even with the sides being made of plastic. Additional features include Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and a 360° antenna. It comes with three years of Android OS updates and six years of security updates.</p>

<p>Launched in May 2024, the Google Pixel 8a comes in Aloe, Bay, Porcelain, or Obsidian. With a matte composite back, matte aluminum frame, and Corning Gorilla Glass 3, it has a smaller 6.1-inch Actua 2,400 x 1,080 OLED display with an adaptive refresh rate that can go from 60-120Hz, depending on the task at hand, and up to 2,000 nits peak brightness.</p><p>Sutrich says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">in his Pixel 8a review</a> that the Google Pixel 8a is his favorite in terms of Pixel designs with a unique camera bar, rounded corners, and a “heavenly” feeling matte finish. Even though the back is plastic, he says it doesn’t feel as such, looking and feeling like a more premium device than it is.</p><p>The phone boasts an all-day 4,492mAh battery that can extend to 72 hours using Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports both 7.5W wireless charging via Qi and 18W fast charging, but Sutrich says it charges very slowly, reaching only 33% after half an hour. Get it with 128GB or 256GB storage.</p><p>Google throws in some nice add-ons with purchases, including three months of Google One with 100GB cloud storage, three months of YouTube Premium, and six months of Fitbit Premium. There are also useful features like Family Link with parental controls if you’re getting this device for a child.</p><p>With an IP67 rating for dust and water resistance, the Google Pixel 8a has Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, fingerprint sensor, face unlock, stereo speakers, and two mics with noise suppression. You’ll get support for even longer with seven years of Feature Drops and as long for security support along with built-in Google VPN, Titan M2 security, anti-malware, anti-phishing, and an auto security and privacy hub.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison.</p>

<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-pro-vs-google-pixel-8a-what-can-these-phones-do-2">Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a: What can these phones do?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB" name="Essential-Space-Organized" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CfVxGY7YHyZyggmEY9z9NB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, let’s dive into what makes these two phones stand out when it comes to usability and features.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro runs on Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on Android 15. It has a Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor with an AI engine and up to 20GB RAM Booster and a Hexagon Tensor Accelerator (HTA) that boosts AI performance. It comes with 8GB or 12GB RAM to keep up with all your daily needs.</p><p>The Essential Space really stands out on this phone, making it simple to organize and catalog all your contents. Soon, the phone will also be able to transcribe on the fly, condense meeting notes, and even pull together to-dos based on your information. Now, it can do things like generate personalized suggestions, summaries, or action points, all leveraging integrated AI.</p><p>Sutrich says Essential Space, which is still in beta, is “very cool” though less useful than he had hoped. It’s basically a digital replacement for a daily planner, and it works well in accomplishing this. How useful you find it will be a personal thing.</p><p>The feature Sutrich really loves and calls a game-changer is the ability to take notes or voice memos on the fly by pressing a single key. As soon as he made a recording, like something he remembered while driving, the AI engine in the phone organized it neatly and provided a summary the next time he looked at his phone.</p><p>Gamers will appreciate the steel vapor chamber, which ensures reduced average versus 60-70FPS on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>. However, he notes that the phone never got warm to the touch and he didn’t experience any performance issues. Nonetheless, his observations are worth keeping in mind if you plan to use the phone for gaming.</p><p>From a security standpoint, all content is stored locally on the phone, and any data sent to the cloud for processing is encrypted and then deleted once the task is done. There’s also built-in ChatGPT.</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a runs on the G3 chip and boasts less RAM at 8GB, but it’s still a pretty powerful phone. It has all the usual Google goodies, including Gemini access and the Gemini assistant, and features like live translate. You can also enjoy features like Circle to Search, call screen, clear calling, hold for me, wait times, and smart replies. Extra safety features include crisis alerts and car crash detection.</p><p>The Family Link area of the phone is useful for parents with teens and tweens who want to be able to monitor usage, set time limits, and ensure they are only accessing appropriate apps and information.</p><p>Performance of this phone varies, Sutrich notes, based on his experience compared to others on the team. While it’s better than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> in terms of benchmarks, even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a>, some Android Central testers find performance snappy while others found that apps constantly re-loaded when switching among them. Further, anything taxing will drain the battery faster than other phones in this class, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12r-review">OnePlus 12R</a>.</p>

How do these two stack up?</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3a Pro has a 50MP main camera with a Sony sensor combined with a 50MP periscope, 8MP ultra-wide, and an impressive 50MP front camera for selfies. The cameras are arranged with a horizontally stacked lens configuration with 3x optical zoom and up to 60x ultra zoom. The large, circular camera island on the back will be polarizing, notes Sutrich, giving off a dramatic and industrial feel that not everyone will like.</p><p>The 50MP front camera supports 4K video recording as well, with AI-powered stabilization and night capture enhancement. There’s also a useful portrait mode as well as Ultra XDR that can capture 8 RAW frames at varying exposures and merge them for photos with more detail. The TrueLens Engine 3 works in the background to ensure pro-grade images, says the company.</p><p>There are also specific camera controls, including Quick record for instantly recording video, burst shot mode, a zoom indicator, and portrait effects. There are personal presets for camera settings so you can save your favorite ones, with images stored in the native Nothing photo gallery.</p><p>Sutrich says the cameras are good, a massive step up from the Nothing Phone 2a, particularly when it comes to zoom detail. “Overall,” he says, “these are great cameras and help build confidence in the brand and its capabilities.”</p>

<p>The Google Pixel 8a has some pretty impressive cameras, too. This includes a 64MP quad PD wide main camera, 13MP ultra-wide, and 13MP front. The main difference here is the much lower-resolution front camera, which won’t yield shots as nice as with the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. But you’ll still get decent selfies.</p><p>Where Google excels is with its many popular photo editing and capture features, which appear in all the latest models, including the Google Pixel 8a. These include ones like Best Take, Audio Magic Eraser, Magic Editor, Night Sight, Real Tone, Photo Unblur, and Portrait Mode. There’s also super res zoom up to 8x.</p><p>Sutrich finds that while the Google Pixel 8a takes great photos, you’ll get the same camera performance on the Google Pixel 7a. He finds that the Google Pixel 8a get exposure right in most cases, pulling out plenty of detail. You will get high contrast and color accurate imagery as well, which is a good thing. This phone, however, doesn’t live up to others in the line in terms of capturing objects in motion. So, if you’re looking to take lots of pics of kids or pets, you might want to consider another Pixel model.</p>

<p>It’s decision time. Between the Nothing Phone 3a Pro vs. Google Pixel 8a, which should you choose? Both are wonderful phones for affordable prices. With the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, you get a cool, stand-out look that will turn heads and have people asking you what phone that is, where you got it, and if it’s any good. By comparison, the Google Pixel 8a looks plainer in comparison, but it’s one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">the best cheap Android phones</a> you can buy right now, providing tremendous value for dollar.</p><p>While the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is newer, the Google Pixel 8a offers more than two times the length of software support, through 2031 whereas software support for the Nothing Phone 3a Pro will end by 2028. That might not sound like a big deal, but even if you don’t plan to keep either phone that long, the Google Pixel 8a will have better resale or trade-in value since it has so much life left in it.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a is slightly more durable but the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is more powerful if you opt for the 12GB RAM version. The Essential Space in the Nothing Phone 3a Pro, while still a work in progress, makes use of AI in a practical way that will only get better over time as well.</p><p>Keep in mind that if you love the Nothing Phone 3a Pro but want to save even more, you can step down to the Nothing Phone 3a, which is more affordable with marginal differences, including slightly less capable cameras without a periscope option. Comparatively, the Google Pixel 7a is still a great budget phone with plenty of years of support still left, and the same camera performance as the Google Pixel 8a. So, if you’re on a super tight budget, these are both solid alternatives that you can find for even less.</p><p>Otherwise, if you want something totally different in terms of look and feel, you might appreciate the Nothing Phone 3a Pro. For something simpler and more traditional in design that still packs a punch in performance, the Google Pixel 8a won’t disappoint.</p>

Of course, I don't have hand-mounted skates in real life, but in Orion Drift, they're a key part of how you move around in the world.</p>

<p>Orion Drift, the latest game from the creators of Gorilla Tag, went into open Early Access on February 25 and it gave me the chance to finally spend time in a public lobby. Previously, I had only played with a few other players after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gorilla-tag-creator-talks-new-game-orion-drift">interviewing the game's creator</a> at Meta Connect 2024. Playing in a public lobby is an entirely different ballgame.</p><p>Like Gorilla Tag, Orion Drift is free-to-play, and movement is driven primarily by your arms. But that's really where the similarities end, as your hand-mounted "skate ball," as I'll call it, lets you drift around like a robot that's watched too many Fast & Furious movies. Things only get wilder when you activate the thrusters on each hand, turning this game into a unique combination of Rocket League, Echo VR, and, of course, Gorilla Tag.</p><p>While Gorilla Tag's movement is interesting and does a great job of reducing motion sickness some players experience with virtual movement in VR, I never found myself returning to that game. Things are <em>very</em> different with Orion Drift, as I've found myself jumping back in again and again to try new things, see new places, and meet new people. Getting better at Driftball is a nice side effect, too.</p>
<h2 id="sports-for-people-who-are-bored-with-earth-2">Sports for people who are bored with Earth</h2>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kuot6dvqV0g" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/echo-vr-season-1-hands">Echo VR</a> before it, Orion Drift's core gameplay revolves around social sports that can't exist in real life. Sure, they're loosely based on actual sports — currently, you can play golf, basketball, parkour/rock climbing, and driftball — but only the most basic core mechanics from those games remain intact.</p><p>You can't hold a ball in Orion Drift; you can only hit it. This makes it a bit like Rocket League mixed with basketball or volleyball, to draw some kind of comparison. Likewise, parkour is similar to real-life parkour but enhanced thanks to the low gravity of the space station and the rocket boosters on your wrists.</p><p>Parkour isn't just a free-for-all showoff section, though. Players can enter Scrap Runs at scheduled times, a game broken into two teams where one team tries to get to the end of the course while the other team attempts to sabotage them in the process. It's chaotic and a <em>ton</em> of fun.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iGRdSiZJADwDYs5ts7yZrJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-drift-ball" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing the main Driftball sport" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iGRdSiZJADwDYs5ts7yZrJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>The community welcomed me right away, showing me the ropes, where to go, and how to have fun.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Golf is where things really start to <em>drift</em> away from their real-world counterparts. These courses look like traditional golf courses — green fields, water and sand traps, trees — but the mechanics are more like frisbee golf meets Rocket League. Yes, again, with the Rocket League comparisons, but it's hard not to make them.</p><p>You won't be using a club; it's just your hands and an innate sense of accuracy. You're hitting a ball at full force with as much momentum as you can build up, trying to get it in the basket at the end of the course.</p><p>But these three sports are all still in development. The real bread-and-butter of Orion Drift is Driftball, a game whose closest real-world counterpart is probably Soccer. Arenas are multi-tiered like those found in Echo VR, but this isn't a zero-gravity experience, even if a lot of mechanics feel similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UrKFKrBxymdsQHJhrVCnuJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-rock-climbing" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing group rock climbing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UrKFKrBxymdsQHJhrVCnuJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>Sure it's free-to-play, but that doesn't mean it has to be ruined by "sweats" or kids. Different servers have different rules, which may mean adults-only, parkour-only, etc.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You can grab the ground and throw yourself to gain some initial momentum, and the hand-mounted thrusters can temporarily propel you higher or farther for a short boost. Boost power can be refilled by collecting one of the containers that spawn on the field, so you'll need to use the power wisely.</p><p>Like Echo VR, you can grab other players and hold on like a jockey, encouraging teamwork and unique skill-building you won't find anywhere else. This can also be done while touring the station, not just during a game, which makes it a handy tool for newcomers and friends traveling to the same place.</p><p>Like any sport, Driftball is something you'll need to practice a lot to get good at. The game has plenty of practice courts, including automated ones, half courts to practice shots with other players, and even separate servers to keep casual players from getting intimidated by "sweats."</p>

<p>One look at the reviews for the game <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/orion-drift/7181769438517329/">on the Meta Horizon store</a> tells you everything you need to know. This isn't just a "game." It's a place you visit and keep coming back to because you love it.</p><p>Central to the Orion Drift experience is a sense of community that most games lack. I'd call it a "metaverse" in that you're together with 75 people at any given time — a number that's set to increase to 200 players once the game hits version 1.0. However, the difference here is that your character doesn't leave the game. It's a fully enclosed system with its own set of specific, customizable character models.</p><p>While the game starts with you alone in a spaceship, you'll quickly choose from a list of available servers or just hit the "quick join" button if you don't care about the server category. All interactions in the game are with your hands, not a laser pointer or some other UI paradigm that makes you feel like you're playing a game. Like Gorilla Tag, this is designed to feel like a world you live in and interact with.</p><p>My first time at the station was filled with friendly interactions that I'm simply not used to in public games. As I meandered around and figured out the locomotion system, a friendly player came up to me and asked how my day was going. After a brief conversation and the admission that this was my first time in the game, he asked me to hop on his back so I could take a station tour.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>This isn't just a "game." It's a place you visit and keep coming back to because you love it.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This was the first magical moment I encountered, and it's stuck with me ever since. Each Orion station is massive. Truly and utterly huge, with a design that feels a lot like a Halo planet. Look up at any time, and you'll get a full view of the rest of the station, including an idea of where you might want to travel to next.</p><p>The station is broken up into districts. Right now, there are "only" three — Driftball, Club (golf), and Parkour — but there are around a dozen different potential districts in development. Zero Gravity is next after Parkour is finished, which should give hardcore Echo VR users something to really celebrate.</p><p>Each district is a flat area that is surprisingly huge. Many districts include multiple levels — the Parkous District has a massive underground area while the Club District has floating golf courses — and each district is separated by free-floating space to keep things distinct.</p>

<p>The first time I grabbed a "zipline" and traveled to another district was surreal. Ziplines are fast but not overly so, avoiding the feeling of motion sickness that some games can cause by only sending players along a forward line rather than introducing any kind of lateral turning motion.</p><p>Likewise, the locomotion system has been proven to help reduce motion sickness, all while introducing more advanced concepts than were available in Gorilla Tag. Drifting with hand skates feels amazing and delivers a realistic sense of speed and momentum that makes me feel like I'm actually doing it, not just standing in the middle of my living room.</p><p>It's this feeling and sense of movement that sticks with me for a while after the end of every session. When I take my headset off, I still have a faint feeling like I should be back in the space station with my fellow Drifters.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The game already has tens of thousands of players, with servers that'll soon support 200 players concurrently, making this a very vibrant, alive collection of worlds.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Anyone who is interested in the game should join the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/oriondrift">Orion Drift Discord</a>, a community that has already reached <strong>50,000 people</strong> in a very short time. Even if you don't want to join it, the game has a calendar listing of events scattered throughout the districts on bulletin boards.</p><p>It's this welcoming community that's made the game feel so immediately palpable — the excellent structure and gameplay mechanics were just the cherry on top — and has kept me coming back after learning the basics. The game even has dedicated servers for parkour or golf, so you can jump right in and ensure a full field of competitors and teammates.</p><p>Even if you're worried about "squeaking kids," there are adults-only fleets in the game that'll kick any player who doesn't meet the age limits. This is the first time in a long time that I've felt like a game is directly addressing the Echo VR community and trying to fill in the wound Meta left <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ready-at-dawn-studios-closing">when it closed Ready at Dawn</a> for good. Another Axiom has done it again, and this time, it feels like everyone can truly enjoy the spectacle.</p>

<p>Garmin and Samsung are both great watchmakers in their own respect. However, pitting the Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra reveals that each wearable is suited for a different type of user.</p><p>Right off the bat, the steep price difference stands out the most. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8 </a>is the same price as the top-tier Galaxy S25 Ultra smartphone. Your bank account will definitely feel the hit from that expenditure. Garmin's ultra-premium wearable gives you insanely high-end and comprehensive health and fitness features though, which some might call a fair trade.</p><p>The real question is whether you should save more than half of that cost and opt for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> instead. Let's break it down to understand.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-fenix-8-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-specifications-2">Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Specifications</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 5" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qw6TDQtQPLtcSn5Xc9qwHH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>Garmin didn't disclose much detailed information about the Fenix 8, so the processor of the smartwatch is unknown. On the other hand, Samsung is a lot more transparent about what you get for your money.</p><p>Strangely, the Garmin Fenix 8 is missing any form of LTE 4G connectivity, so right off the bat the Galaxy Watch Ultra wins if you absolutely must have cellular support on your wrist.</p><p>Another key difference is that the Galaxy Watch Ultra runs Wear OS, so it naturally offers a much wider assortment of third-party app support. Garmin OS isn't bad, but isn't nearly as versatile and doesn't offer as many apps as any of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">best Wear OS watches</a>.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-fenix-8-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-breaking-it-down-2">Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Breaking it down</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 3" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sqdFhWDNv7iqLQVbhPhjXH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Garmin Fenix 8 and Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra are both super powerful watches, promising days upon days of battery life. Where the Samsung wearable delivers 40 hours of uptime with the AOD enabled, the Fenix 8 gives it a run for its money with a week or two's worth of battery life.</p><p>Speaking about his experience while testing the Fenix 8, our reviewer Michael L Hicks stated that the watch lasts two weeks for him including lots of multi-band GPS tracking, while the Galaxy Watch Ultra might last four days at most or two to three days with heavy use.</p><p>The Garmin Fenix 8 and Galaxy Watch Ultra weigh about the same, but that's only for the Titanium variation of the Fenix 8. The Watch Ultra's display is brighter and larger, but the Fenix 8's display is still bright enough in most cases and doesn't have as much <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/android-smartwatches-have-a-flicker-problem-the-oneplus-watch-3-fixed-it" target="_blank">flickering.</a> All in all, you can easily use both wearables outdoors and have high visibility under the sun.</p><p>Garmin does a better job of connecting to external devices like heart rate monitors or cycling power meters over Bluetooth or ANT+. This is a shortcoming of Wear OS watches and not just the Galaxy Watch Ultra, because they just aren't very good at that in general.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="KUgQCUghU98sDNnB7UcBLH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 4" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KUgQCUghU98sDNnB7UcBLH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3720" height="2092" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As mentioned earlier, Garmin OS isn't anywhere near as versatile with app support as Wear OS. Garmin doesn't have an app store, but you do get access to a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming apps</a> such as Spotify, YouTube Music, and Amazon Music. There are other apps for the weather and integrations with fitness apps like Komoot as well.</p><p>Since Wear OS is made by Google, Google Maps naturally runs smoother on the Galaxy Watch for navigation. However, Garmin has better offline topographical maps and creatable handy routes for workouts.</p><p>The UI is quite different across both wearables. The Galaxy Watch Ultra has tiles for various apps. Meanwhile, Garmin has widgets that focus on key health and fitness data. Samsung obviously has the edge when it comes to UI, but it's worth noting that the Fenix 8's UI is better than most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>.</p><p>The fundamental difference between the two watches is the level of advanced health and workout tools and features offered. Samsung still doesn't do training loads, fitness plans, daily suggested workouts, or other key Garmin tools. But it does have something called Energy Score, which is pretty similar to Garmin's Body Battery metric.</p><p>The Fenix 8 offers some of the most in-depth metrics, data tracking, and training tools for any fitness-focused individual. It can even take naps into account, among thousands of other workout and sports-related features. Garmin also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-needs-to-make-indoor-workouts-as-good-as-outdoor-ones">improved its indoor workouts</a>, something Micheal had been wishing for a while. The only real issue is that all Garmin watches have the Garmin Coach, so you can probably wait for a while and get this feature on a much cheaper Garmin wearable eventually.</p><p>Finally, both the Garming and Samsung watches have highly accurate GPS and heart rate sensors. Based on his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-fitness-test" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch Ultra fitness test</a>, Michael estimates that the Watch Ultra isn't that far off from the Fenix 8 for GPS accuracy. At the end of the day though, Garmin is the best in the industry. Therefore, the Fenix 8 is generally better at both, especially when it comes to high-intensity workouts.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-fenix-8-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-which-should-you-buy-2">Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Which should you buy?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4029px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kgPVJU79cZZtCFMd8X9CpH" name="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra 2" alt="Garmin Fenix 8 vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kgPVJU79cZZtCFMd8X9CpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4029" height="2266" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael L Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The final comparison left to do is the price. Once you've weighed the pros and cons of both smartwatches, it becomes very obvious that the Garmin Fenix 8 is far too expensive. The wearable doesn't have any noteworthy feature that stands out starkly. There's nothing unique enough or impressive enough that jumps out and justifies that thousand-dollar price tag.</p><p>As Michael said in his Fenix 8 review, if you've got a fancy vacation home in Tahoe or a regular surfing spot near your home in Santa Cruz, then you probably have the money to buy the Fenix 8 and not worry much about the high cost. In that case, you'll get the most out of the smartwatch and enjoy it without wincing at the thought of the money it cost you.</p><p>However, the common man is going to call it a day and stick with the significantly cheaper Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra instead. The watch launched at $650, but it's constantly on sale. Even at the time of writing, you can get one for just $420. And that's with LTE support, which is something the Fenix 8 lacks. Besides, the Samsung watch also comes with Wear OS and almost as accurate HR and GPS sensors.</p><p>So unless you're a serious athlete making bank, I'd suggest you grab the Galaxy Watch Ultra for less than half the price of the Fenix 8.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is rolling out an Always On Display update for its One UI 7 devices (the Galaxy S25 series).</li><li>The patch focuses on improving the experience behind its notification management, as well as giving users more agency with Google Sports.</li><li>Samsung confirmed One UI 7 will go live for eligible Galaxy devices in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is looking to refine the experience of its Now Bar for users, which should make things clear and easy.</p><p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-aod-update-improves-google-sports-integration-now-bar/">SammyGuru</a>, Samsung is rolling out an update for the Always On Display for devices with One UI 7 (basically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy S25 series</a>). The update itself is light; however, it focuses on making the experience much easier for users looking to utilize the Now Bar more effectively. According to the publication, the update brings a "notice" about notifications via the Now Bar.</p><p>When in the Now Bar settings, users may see a "App notifications are turned off" label under apps that fit the bill. Users should be able to dive in and change anything that needs to, if it's an app that you need to see more prominently on the lock screen's Now Bar.</p><p>Elsewhere, the update's changelog states it adds a "Google Sports settings guide" alongside an "improved Google Sports-related GUI."</p><p>The publication's findings show that users diving into the Now Bar's settings and tapping Google Sports will see a "Sports from Google Settings" button. From there, a pop-up will surface with professional sports leagues with "Following" and "Recommended" tabs. There, users can more easily select which teams — or even leagues — they'd like to be displayed on their Now Bar.</p><p>These updates are appearing with v8.8.25.5 of the Always on Display app for Samsung.</p>

<p>In other news, Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-good-lock-launcher-refresh-update-rolls-out">pushed an update</a> for its Good Lock app launcher for Galaxy devices. The patch was minimalistic as it offered small changes to the language used when explaining functions. The patch notes stated Samsung was also "improving app stabilization" for users, though it failed to explicitly state which apps are affected.</p><p>To go along with One UI 7, Samsung highlighted a complete <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-good-lock-is-going-global-with-a-fresh-redesign-in-one-ui-7">Good Lock overhaul</a> for its next-gen OS. While the company's smartphones will see updates, the redesign focused a lot on its foldables by improving the "overall composition" of the app's UI.</p><p>While this Always On Display update leaves most Galaxy users out of the loop, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">confirmed</a> One UI 7 is arriving in April. After a lengthy history of delays, it seems most of the kinks and frustrations have been ironed out to a place Samsung is comfortable. Additionally, with One UI 7 coming to devices next month, the company is planning Beta Programs for other devices.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 have already received <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">the first beta</a>. The company states there's more to come for the likes of the Galaxy S23 series and Galaxy Tab S10 series.</p>

For a limited time, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-6361382-17038710?sid=hawk-custom-tracking"><strong>you can join Verizon Home Internet on the 5G Home Plus plan and choose between a free 43-inch Samsung TV or a Meta Quest 3S, no strings attached</strong></a>. The gifts may seem a bit random, but knowing how rare Meta Quest deals are, I'm not about to start complaining.</p><p>Starting at $55 per month, Verizon's 5G Home Plus plan comes with ultra-fast internet speeds and Ultra HD 4K streaming, a free Wi-Fi extender for "whole-home" coverage, and a three-year price guarantee. If you're already using one of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon's wireless plans</a>, you'll also get a free perk credit added to your account. This monthly credit can be used on perks like a Netflix and Max (with ads) subscription, the Disney Bundle, and more.</p>

Join Verizon Home Internet with the 5G Home Plus plan and you'll get to choose between a free Meta Quest 3S headset or a 43-inch Samsung TV, values of $299.99 and $329.99, respectively. Deals on the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/best-vr-headsets">best VR headsets</a> are quite uncommon, so unless you <em>really</em> need a TV, I'd recommend opting for the Quest.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-6361382-17038710?sid=hawk-custom-tracking" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="1a2ee433-1a17-4c73-b581-3f197412b957" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Sign up for the 5G Home Plus plan and get a FREE Meta Quest 3S or Samsung TV at Verizon" data-dimension48="Sign up for the 5G Home Plus plan and get a FREE Meta Quest 3S or Samsung TV at Verizon" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>This isn't the first time that Verizon has offered free gifts for home internet customers, but it's the first time that I've seen a Meta Quest included in the promo. If you're unfamiliar, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3s-review">Quest 3S</a> is essentially Meta's attempt at bringing VR entertainment into the mainstream. The console boasts most of the same hardware and processing power found in the more-expensive Quest 3, plus you'll get mixed-reality passthrough, 8GB of RAM, and access to the full library of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta games and apps</a>.</p><p>The downside is that you'll have to deal with a last-gen lens and a narrower field of view than the Quest 3, but if you're new to VR, it's unlikely that you'll even notice. It's also worth mentioning that the upcoming spring sales might come with some Meta Quest discounts, but if you're looking for a new internet provider AND you want to get into VR gaming, this is an awesome opportunity.</p>

<p>Today (Mar. 13), Google highlighted a host of Gemini app updates and features users can soon expect.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/new-gemini-app-features-march-2025/">blog post</a>, Google announced a series of improvements en route for Gemini, beginning with the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. According to the post, this upgrade for the model gives Gemini the ability to accept "new features," such as file uploads. More importantly, Google states the upgraded model gives Gemini more capabilities to break down prompts into "a series of steps" for better responses.</p><p>The 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model also gives Gemini Advanced users a 1M context token window to understand/compute complex problems.</p>

<p>Those who utilize <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">the Gemini app</a> regularly are in for a more personalized treat as Google rolls out a major update. The company says, beginning today (Mar 13), users will notice an experimental feature called "personalization." This is powered by the upgraded 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model to connect your Google apps and services with Gemini.</p><p>The company states this is done to facilitate a "tailored" experience that <em>should </em>fit your needs, should you desire. The test will initially begin by leveraging your behavior in Search. As an example, Google states users looking for restaurant recommendations will see Gemini dive into your Search history for anything food-related.</p><p>Google states users can enable the personalization test in Gemini by selecting its option via the "Model" drop-down menu. The post adds that users remain in control of Gemini and can disable this feature whenever they like.</p><p>Speaking of leveraging connecting apps, Google says it's bringing more services to Gemini, like Calendar, Notes, Tasks, and Photos via 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Due to this, Gemini is said to have better capabilities to process complex queries that involve multiple Google apps. As an example, a user could ask Gemini to discover a recipe on YouTube, add the necessary ingredients to a shopping list, <em>and </em>find the nearest store.</p><p>Google then teased additional integration between Gemini and the Photos app, so users can ask for help/questions "based on your photos."</p><p>Lastly, Google announces that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini#:~:text=a%20specific%20conversation.-,Gems%3A,-Gemini%20Advanced%20lets">Gemini's Gems</a> — which lets users create their own personalized AI — are rolling out for "everyone at no cost" in the app.</p>

Today, Google states Deep Research will benefit from the 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model for "enhanced" functions.</p><p>Google says this will concern "all stages:" planning, searching, and reasoning, as well as analyzing and reporting.</p><p>With this upgrade, users will discover deeper insights into <em>how </em>Gemini thinks while it's attempting to fulfill your query. Users will see, in real-time, Gemini's web searches and how it compiles the information for your viewing pleasure once it's done.</p><p>To celebrate the update, Google announces Deep Research is coming to all users globally within the Model drop-down menu in Gemini. However, Google states users can "try Deep Research a few times a month at no cost, and Gemini Advanced users get expanded access to Deep Research to save even more time on their most complex projects."</p>

<ul><li>Samsung speaks up about the recent string of One UI 8 rumors surface, stating its most likely just "internal test" builds with the company's devices.</li><li>The One UI Beta team encourages users to keep tabs on its official channels for more appropriate information regarding the software's development.</li><li>Recent rumors state Samsung has started internally testing One UI 8 on the Galaxy S25 series and that the OS could arrive "earlier" this year.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung is breaking its silence over the recent string of internal testing rumors for its Android 16-based OS release.</p><p>In response to a recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Questions/One-Ui-8-Beta/m-p/3167416#M35">community post</a>, a One UI Beta team member states there's nothing official (yet) about One UI 8 for stable users or testers. The thread started with questions regarding the supposed start of One UI 8 testing on the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 "outside the U.S." Samsung's response to this is "One UI 8.0 has not been officially announced or released for any devices."</p><p>The OP (original poster) cited a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/samsung-begins-testing-one-ui-8-0-for-galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6/">SammyGuru</a>, which highlights alleged evidence of a test underway for One UI 8 on the Flip 6 and Fold 6 in India.</p><p>The One UI Beta member states that while rumors have brought awareness to "certain devices" with One UI 8, "these are likely internal Samsung test units." They add that these devices are typically "used for early-stage development and are not available for public use."</p><p>Samsung encourages users to keep tabs on its official channels for any updates regarding future One UI betas or rollouts. Nothing official has arrived for enrolled testers yet, which is good (in a way) considering there's something more important we still need.</p>

<p>Most consumers haven't even gotten their promised One UI 7 update yet and rumors have already veered toward an "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">earlier</a>" One UI 8. A tipster on X claimed Samsung may skip the typically expected in between updates for its Android 15-based One UI 7 update. They suggest the possibility of a "One UI 7.1" or "7.1.1" is out of the question as the company could drop Galaxy users right into One UI 8 after.</p><p>Meanwhile, we saw similar rumors about internal <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-will-bring-one-ui-8-sooner">One UI 8 testing</a> for the Galaxy S25 crop up just recently. Another tipster on X posted a few alleged build numbers for the series and the next software iteration. Unlike the other rumor, this Galaxy S25 specific one didn't mention the country this was spotted in. Regardless, as we've seen from Samsung's One UI Beta team, it's simply internal/early stage development progress for now.</p><p>Samsung's One UI 7 has been hit with a severe amount of delays, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">its fourth beta</a> arrived toward the end of February. While Samsung has grappled with various issues, it finally confirmed One uI 7 will arrive for all eligible Galaxy devices <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">in April</a>.</p><p>But speculation on an earlier One UI 8 comes as Google is fast-tracking its Android 16 update. Google is interested in launching its next major Android OS in Q2 2025. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">Android 16 Beta 2</a> arrived for enrolled Pixels in February, which is right on schedule with what it foresees for the next upgrade.</p>

<ul><li>Google announces Android 16 Beta 3, bringing accessibility tools along with it.</li><li>It brings a feature that allows low-vision users to read texts more comfortably with Text Outline.</li><li>Android 16 Beta 3 introduces a feature called "Local Network Protection," allowing users more control over which apps can access their devices.</li><li>It has also expanded Auracast compatibility with support for hearing aids, making those who use one feel more involved during public announcements, concerts, etc.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/the-third-beta-of-android-16.html" target="_blank">officially dropped</a> a new beta version of the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update today (Mar. 13), which is set to debut in June.</p><p>In a press release, the company said that Android 16 Beta 3 has reached the "Platform Stability" stage and that this will be available to all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.google.com/android/beta">enrolled users, including those with Pixels</a>.</p><p>This means that all in-app behaviors are final, i.e., the actions that users will take within a certain app. And app developers have been given a final call to make necessary changes to their apps to avoid compatibility issues with the updated OS.</p><p>Every Beta version comes with its own set of fun features, but this time, Google is keeping it short. It stated that since this is the last stage of the OS development cycle, "there are only a few new things in the Android 16 Beta 3 release." Let's break it down for you.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oWFyzQd3RCcSWmrNSTdUjg" name="Android16-Beta-3-text-outline" alt="Screenshot showing the text outline feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oWFyzQd3RCcSWmrNSTdUjg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Text with enhanced contrast before(left) and after(right) Android 16's new outline text accessibility feature </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First off, this beta version is bringing a new accessibility tool for those with low vision who struggle to read texts due to certain contrast sensitivity. To help these users, the OS will outline text and change the background color of the text box, making the text pop and increasing legibility. The image above provides an example of what this will look like.</p><p>Secondly, along with this feature, it will also bring something called "Local Network Protection," which will essentially act as a gatekeeper for home devices. It will seek permission when an app tries to access/connect to devices like printers, smart TVs, or any other gadget that shares your Wi-Fi or Data — giving more control to the user. Google adds that developers can opt-in for this feature to "test your app and identify any parts that rely on local network access."</p>
<h2 id="auracast-support-for-hearing-aids-2">Auracast support for hearing aids</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP" name="Auracast-experience-airport-smartphone-IFA-2024.jpg" alt="A phone connected to another phone's Auracast broadcast" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Uqxr59qzLbWWsE3PsiDZDP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Along with the above features, Google is finally bringing "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>" support to Pixels, which allows audio to be broadcast from one source to several others. This also offers additional accessibility as it's compatible with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/auracast-hearing-aids-earbuds/">hearing aids and earbuds</a>.</p><p>For instance, people with hearing aids may miss out on important announcements that happen in public spaces like train stations or concerts due to extensive external noise. However, with Auracast's support, users can directly tune into Auracast broadcasts from compatible devices like TV streamers to receive direct audio streams to their hearing aids. This feature also gives users the ability to personalize their broadcast streams.</p><p>It is important to note that only LE audio-compatible hearing aids from companies like GN Hearing and Starkey are supported. Samsung Galaxy devices with One UI 7 (Android 15) and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> devices running the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">Android 16 beta</a> can be connected to public streams.</p><p>"To make access to streams convenient for all, we also partnered together on a QR code standard to connect to broadcasts without needing to go into your settings," the press release added. People with Pixel 9 devices have first dibs on QR code access.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.50%;"><img id="tPBTwCr3Xojm6DhmHUi96G" name="Android-16-beta-3-platform-stability" alt="Android 16 beta timeline, March 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPBTwCr3Xojm6DhmHUi96G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="960" height="408" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, Google states that it's in the homestretch before it publicly releases Android 16 to the masses. That said, there could be a few more final beta releases before the launch set to happen by the end of June. "We’re putting additional energy into working with our device partners to bring the Q2 release to as many devices as possible," the company said.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the past few weeks, Retroid has been drip-feeding everyone with little bits of information about its upcoming Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic. With all of the specs and colors revealed, all that was left was price and availability. This morning, Retroid did just that, as it shared how much both of these new gaming handhelds.</p><p>As such, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Retroid Pocket Flip 2</a> is set to retail for either $229 or $189, depending on whether you want the Dimensity 1100 or Snapdragon 865. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/retroid-pocket-classic-launch">Retroid Pocket Classic</a> will set you back either $119 for the 4GB+64GB model or $129 for 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:122.03%;"><img id="4dvLrB74FG3ZpmX7u8cHb6" name="retroid-pocket-flip-2-pocket-classic-price-availability" alt="Pricing and availability overview for the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and Pocket Classic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4dvLrB74FG3ZpmX7u8cHb6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1888" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, once pre-orders open on March 17, Retroid is offering a $10 discount on the Flip 2 and $5 on the Classic before jumping up to the retail price once these go on sale. However, Retroid is <em>also</em> offering a "Combo," which saves you $30 and includes both the Snapdragon 865-powered Pocket Flip 2 and the 6GB/128GB Pocket Classic.</p><p>Sure, it's only $30, but for that, you're getting <em>two</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">Android gaming handhelds</a>. What makes this special isn't the price; you'll have different form factors to enjoy. So, if you're out and about and want to play some retro games, just stick the Classic in your <em>pocket</em> before you leave. And when you're home, sit back and relax with the larger screen and better ergonomics of the Pocket Flip 2.</p><p>While the Pocket Flip 2 and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/snapdragon-870-vs-snapdragon-888-vs-snapdragon-865">Snapdragon 865</a> SoC might seem a bit outdated, it still offers plenty of power for both emulation and other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-games">Android games</a>. But there's a good chance that it will have another trick up its sleeve, and that's the ability to emulate Xbox and even PS3 games.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="edLufPR6iGi4FRufzh2Yu5" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-review-15" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro with Retroid Pocket 5 and Anbernic RG406H" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edLufPR6iGi4FRufzh2Yu5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>No, you won't find an Xbox emulator on the Play Store or hiding in a GitHub repo. However, after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.goretroid.com/products/retroid-pocket-5-handheld?srsltid=AfmBOor9oGxGTjdBxrcYFtQDl7ZqO9S-spc_AKYg7XfsX0DM_dIJn2vc">Retroid Pocket 5</a> was released late last year, it wasn't long before Linux gaming firmware was made available. Both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://rocknix.org/">ROCKNIX</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://wiki.batocera.org/choose_a_handheld#retroid_pocket_5_retroid_pocket_mini">Batocera</a> can be downloaded and installed, making it possible to play Xbox games on your "Android" handheld.</p><p>That's not even the best part: you don't lose access to Android if you want to try either of these out. The installation steps are fairly tedious, but you're not actually installing the software to the internal storage on the Pocket 5. Instead, you just flash it to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card</a> from your computer.</p><p>Once that's done, pop in the microSD card, hold down one of the volume buttons while restarting, and a few minutes later, you'll have a Linux gaming handheld. And if you want to switch back over to play some Android games, all you have to do is take out the microSD card and restart. Then, you'll be right back into the native Android experience that Retroid provides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8" name="retroid-pocket-5-halo-2-anbernic-rg35xxsp-gamesir-super-nova-controller" alt="Playing Halo 2 on the Retroid Pocket 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xdc7ksvpoxfqoDvL63HKT8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All of this is made possible thanks to the Snapdragon 865, which is exactly the same chip that we're getting in the Retroid Pocket Flip 2. While I assume some tweaks will have to be made to account for the clamshell form factor, there's no reason to believe that we won't get ROCKNIX and Batocera on the Flip 2.</p><p>Although much of our focus is more on Android gaming handhelds, those only account for a fraction of the market. There are so many more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/black-friday-gaming-handhelds">retro gaming handhelds</a> out there, with the majority of them that make use of Linux-based firmware. But with the Retroid Pocket Flip 2 and the Pocket Classic, you won't have to pick and choose.</p>

<ul><li>Google Photos finally brings "Undo backup" to Android devices, giving them more control over their storage.</li><li>With this, users can delete all media files that are currently on Google Photos without making them vanish from the device itself.</li><li> iOS users received this feature back in December 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Photos announced on Wednesday that it is finally rolling out an "undo backup" option to its mobile app on Android. This option showed up on iPhones late last year, and now it has made its way into Android devices.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/330429602/you-now-have-more-control-over-your-backed-up-photos-videos">support page </a>detailing the change, Google stated that this  option will now give users "more control over your backed up photos & videos." This essentially means that users can delete media files that have been backed up on the Google Photos app and not worry about it vanishing from the device itself, which was usually the case until now.</p><p>This Undo device backup feature will help users free up some storage space on their cloud without worrying about losing their media files. This is for when you “might not want all of your photos on your device backed up anymore.”</p>

<p>However, it is important to know that once you delete your photos on Google Photos, they will also be deleted from other spaces on the cloud, like shared albums, memories, and other albums you may have created within the app. Furthermore, photos and videos within the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-enable-and-use-locked-folder-google-photos">Locked folder</a> will be deleted from the app.</p><p>That said, here's how you can free up some space on your Google Photos cloud with "undo device backup."</p><p><strong>Open the Google Photos app on your phone > tap your Profile picture or initial > Photos settings > Backup > tap on</strong> <strong>Undo backup for this device.</strong></p><p>You will then be prompted to check a box confirming the action. After that, hit Delete Google Photos backup. Once you do this, the app will no longer store the deleted photos, and backup to the device will be turned off automatically.</p><p>In other news, Google Photos is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-losing-a-feature-your-long-distance-family-loved">reportedly</a> cutting off access to automatic syncing for digital photo frames like Aura and Cozyla. This move was made in an attempt to prevent third-party apps from accessing Google Photos, boosting user privacy.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-67">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>After the Honey scandal, Google tightened its rules to stop shady affiliate link practices in Chrome extensions.</li><li>Instead of just finding deals, Honey was secretly swapping affiliate links, cutting creators and influencers out of their earnings.</li><li>Google’s new rules demand transparency, banning extensions from messing with shopping cookies or adding affiliate links without clear user consent.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The recent uproar over PayPal’s Honey extension, mainly its shady handling of affiliate links, has pushed Google to tighten the reins on its policies. The new rules lay down clear, strict guidelines for extensions, putting an end to the kind of sketchy behavior that sparked the whole fiasco in the first place.</p><p>Despite its claim to help users find the best deals and coupons, the Honey link scandal exposed a sneaky tactic of secretly swapping in affiliate links. This move siphoned potential earnings away from content creators and influencers who rely on those commissions.</p><p>Following the revelations, Google is tightening the rules on shopping extensions in the Chrome Web Store, as officially announced on its developer support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/webstore/program-policies/affiliate-ads" target="_blank">portal</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/google-chrome-affiliate-extension-policy-honey/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>For the uninitiated, Honey is a Chrome extension owned by PayPal that helps users find coupon codes at checkout. In exchange, it activates PayPal’s affiliate link, earning the company a commission on purchases made through the extension.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vc4yL3YTwWk" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Unfortunately, it turned out Honey was slapping its affiliate link on purchases left and right, even when it didn’t find any usable coupon codes. On top of that, it was caught swapping out existing affiliate links, effectively hijacking commissions that would’ve gone to others.</p>
<h2 id="a-win-for-transparency-2">A win for transparency</h2>
<p>Moving forward, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Google Chrome</a> extensions can only use affiliate links, discount codes, and cookies if they offer a clear, direct benefit at checkout, like real discounts or cash rebates. Extensions also can’t mess with shopping cookies or add affiliate links without upfront, transparent disclosure to users.</p><p>The new policy requires extensions to inject affiliate links only when triggered by a direct user action; a rule that effectively shuts down Honey’s old tactics.</p><p>The “related user action” rule is highlighted by cracking down on shady practices like: secretly tweaking shopping cookies while users browse online stores, sneaking in or swapping affiliate codes into URLs without permission, and slapping on or replacing promo codes without the user’s knowledge.</p><p>The Honey link fallout hurt creators and influencers, but the policy changes that came out of it is a win for everyone. They ensure Chrome extensions do what they promise, making the platform more transparent and trustworthy for users.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has announced that it’s expanding support for native PC games with a new earn-back program. With the Game Developers Conference (GDC) underway, the search giant has also announced that it is bringing users more games and more ways to play games across devices.</p><p>At GDC, the company will be showcasing all games coming to Google Play, and additionally, the new developer tools, which are claimed to improve gameplay across the Android ecosystem. Alongside the earn-back program, Google Play Games on PC will also be generally available this year with major upgrades.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iP-Bzzn8q4s" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Google Play connects over two billion monthly active players worldwide. The new tools will help them engage these players across a wide range of devices, further driving engagement and revenue. Google is also hoping that since the gaming experiences are more immersive on PC, the company is trying to make bigger investments in the PC gaming platform.</p><p>After announcing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-games-on-pc-reaches-india">Google Play Games on PC</a>, which lets users play mobile games on PC, the search giant is expanding this support to native PC games. This means users will be able to enjoy native PC games on their Android phones.</p><p>Google now has a PC program, which includes a dedicated SDK for native PC games on Google Play Games that additionally provides powerful tools, including in-app purchase integration and advanced security protection.</p>
<p>The expansion also includes distribution through Play Console. It allows developers to manage their mobile and PC game builds in one place. It can further help simplify the process of packaging PC versions, configuring releases, and managing store listings. The earn-back program, as mentioned, will bring PC games to Google Play Games on PC, further unlocking up to 15% additional earnings.</p><p>Furthermore, Google is making all mobile games available on PC by default, and they can be opted out at any point. On the store, games will have a playability badge, which indicates the games’ compatibility with PC. Right beside the install button, users will also see “optimized” and “playable” options, which mean they offer a great gaming experience, and that games meet the minimum requirements to play well on PC, respectively. Google also assures that many games are already playable right out of the box.</p>

<p>The PC experience is also getting major upgrades, as gamers can now fully enjoy the Google Play Games on PC catalog on more devices, like AMD laptops and desktops. Google is also partnering with PC OEMs to make Google Play Games more accessible right from the start menu. Users will also be gaining new features like custom controls and a huge sidebar that allows quick adjustments. Additionally, multi-account and multi-instance support is also rolling out this month.</p>

<p>The Play Points experience is also promised to be more seamless on PC, as now they are easier to track and rewarding, including up to 10x points boosters on Google Play Games.  It allows players to earn and redeem points for in-game purchases and discounts.</p><p>Google asserts that at GDC, users will be able to enjoy complete gaming experiences on the best Android gaming devices and recommends that they meet at Moscone Center West Hall.</p>

<ul><li>Google is making Vulkan the default graphics API for Android, unlocking next-level visuals with ray tracing and multithreading.</li><li>If your favorite game still runs on OpenGL, no worries—Google’s ANGLE driver converts it to Vulkan for smoother gameplay.</li><li>Google Play Games is bringing more PC exclusives to mobile and making mobile games easier to play on desktops.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>At this year’s Game Developers Conference, Google rolled out a bunch of updates aimed at making games run better and keeping players more engaged across different platforms.</p><p>First up, Google has made Vulkan the go-to graphics API for Android. This move gives game developers the tools to tap into advanced rendering features like ray tracing and multithreading, paving the way for richer, more immersive visuals.</p><p>Games like Diablo Immortal are already putting Vulkan to work, while Pokémon TCG Pocket is seeing smoother performance across devices.</p><p>If your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-premium-android-games">favorite game</a> still runs on OpenGL, Google is introducing ANGLE, a system driver that translates OpenGL to Vulkan. More Android devices will rely on Vulkan moving forward, and major engines like Unity are making Vulkan integration even easier.</p><p>To help developers squeeze even more power from GPUs, Google is partnering with Samsung’s Austin Research Center to create an integrated GPU profiler for Vulkan. This tool, set for launch later this year, is designed to optimize graphics, memory, and AI-driven workloads.</p><p>Android’s Dynamic Performance Framework (ADPF) is also getting a boost to ensure longer gaming sessions without overheating. It does this by dynamically adjusting performance based on device temperature. It now has stronger support from chipmakers like MediaTek. MMORPGs like Lineage W are already using ADPF to optimize performance.</p>
<h2 id="pc-games-coming-to-mobile-2">PC games coming to mobile</h2>
<p>Additionally, Google Play Games is expanding its library, bringing PC-only games to mobile and making mobile titles easier to play on desktops. Expect to see DREDGE, TABS Mobile, and Disco Elysium hitting Google Play this year, all optimized for mobile gaming.</p><p>Google Play Games is also expanding its library with more titles, including Game of Thrones: Kingsroad, Sonic Rumble, and Odin: Valhalla Rising.  The full Google Play Games on PC catalog will be available on more devices, including AMD laptops and desktops.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-nanometer-2">What is a nanometer?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1250px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uASsy7e38RJqyJhXrjy92e" name="micrometer-gauge" alt="A Starrett outside micrometer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uASsy7e38RJqyJhXrjy92e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1250" height="703" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A nanometer (that's what the nm stands for) is a unit of metric measurement; 0.000000004 meters, to be precise. It's tiny, so tiny you can't see it without a microscope, and anything that small is extremely fragile, so a stiff breeze will break it.</p><p>When it comes to processors, the term nm refers to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/technology_node">node size of the chip</a>. A smaller number means smaller transistors are placed on the silicon bed. A 6nm chip uses 6nm transistors, while a 4nm chip uses 4nm transistors. But not really.</p><p>It's also a marketing term for processors. Yes, I'm telling you that a 4nm chip doesn't actually have 4nm parts on it; they <em>are</em> smaller parts than the previously labeled 6nm chips, though (which weren't actually 6nm, either). Here's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/1kQUXpZpLXI?si=2HitpcidW45Oq2jG">a video showing</a> that a 14nm chip from one vendor uses parts the same size as a 7nm chip from another vendor.</p><p>Basically, it's one of those things that only engineers will ever care about, but we're told to care about it anytime a chip maker refines its process to use smaller numbers. Should we?</p>

<h2 id="potential-benefits-of-a-smaller-node-2">Potential benefits of a smaller node</h2>
<p>There are two real, tangible benefits of a smaller process node: part density and energy efficiency.</p><p>You can fit more 4nm parts on a chip than you could 6nm. It's not a one-to-one calculation, so you're not actually getting 33% more transistors, but it will work out to a sizable number. That's because the advancement isn't just a numbers game, it's more like an evolution that can be combined with other advancements.</p><p>Transistors are the worker ants of a processor and do the calculations. It doesn't matter if those calculations are for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/huawei-chip-is-the-heart-that-powers-deepseek-ai-claims-recent-leak">AI acceleration</a>, as part of a GPU, or just to tell when you tap a letter on your keyboard. If it requires any sort of processor activity (almost everything you do on your phone does), a series of transistors are doing that work.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.51%;"><img id="mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc" name="snapdragon-8-gen-4-specs-leak.jpg" alt="Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 specs leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mjVG3yYtzdAvTk3qFcQerc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="375" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SmartPrix)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In simple terms, more transistors can do more work. The process node advancement in other areas means the gains in performance can be significant. At least on paper, and we'll talk more about that in a minute.</p>
<p>Smaller transistors also use less power. Like part density, other improvements will compound these gains and matter as much or more than any actual power savings from a smaller part. It's important to remember that a by-the-numbers look means to see any actual improvements, 4nm transistors need to cumulatively use 34% less power than 6nm parts because there will be 33% more of them on a chip.</p><p>Again, it doesn't work like that in real life, so the "other advancements" bit makes more of a difference when it comes to new chips being more efficient than the previous models.</p><p>This is why "4nm" is more of a marketing term than an actual measurement. As with any industry, chip makers like to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-promises-accessible-flagships-with-new-4nm-dimensity-8200-chip">toot their own horn</a> about the process node size they have developed, but these numbers are mostly used because we can understand that 4nm is better than 6nm without knowing all of the details.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-actual-benefits-for-me-2">What about actual benefits for me?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kFEeRViMjS2gEsx3okvkzJ" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-exclusive-samsung-colors" alt="The three Samsung.com exclusive Galaxy S25 Ultra colors" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kFEeRViMjS2gEsx3okvkzJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The benefits of a smaller process are there even though we won't notice them.</p><p>Yes, this goes against almost everything you'll read telling why 3nm or 4nm is so great and such a breakthrough, but it's the truth. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't care about it, but you should understand that this improvement is just part of the overall advancement of the modern processor and isn't something you'll ever notice on its own.</p><p>This is because there is a limit to any benefit of shrinking down circuits, and we're very close to it. If chip makers only focused on building smaller transistors and circuits, they would spend billions to offer products that are no better than previous generations.</p><p>Even with all the other chip advancements, we barely notice a difference in a yearly chip upgrade, and those advancements can be much more dramatic than just shrinking the process node. Chip makers have to tell you that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">the latest offering</a> has the potential for 12% better performance and 30% better battery life because you'll never notice it if they don't tell you to look for it.</p><p>The latest chip from Apple or Qualcomm isn't great because it has smaller transistors, but it's great because of all of the other "stuff" engineers are doing to improve performance and power efficiency. One day, we'll see another breakthrough, but unless you compare a 4nm chip to something like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/motorola-edge-s-could-be-first-phone-mysterious-new-snapdragon-800-series-chipset">28nm chip</a>, size doesn't really matter much.</p>

<p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">reviewed the Phone 2a</a> last year, I called it the best budget phone of the year. In 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a Pro</a> is carrying that mantle. Nothing's latest phone retains a similar foundation as its predecessor, so you get an interesting design at the back, clean software with useful extras, good customizability, timely software updates, and great cameras. <br><br>Interestingly, the 3a Pro gets a 50MP telephoto lens, giving it a distinct advantage over the 2a. Nothing switched over to Qualcomm silicon once again, and that's a good thing — the phone has much better performance in gaming and daily use versus the 2a and 2a Plus. <br><br>I used the Phone 3a Pro for just over a week now, and I'm convinced that this is the only budget phone worth buying in India. I like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/poco-x7-pro-review">POCO X7 Pro</a> as well, but the software on that device isn't anywhere as good, and it doesn't quite have the same design flair.</p>
<h2 id="a-design-that-shines-literally-2">A design that shines — literally </h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro with LED lights enabled" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/44Q6Ti8dwBfQVCVcDxdwQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 3a Pro's design is divisive — Nothing admitted as much during the briefing. The phone still has a unique see-through pattern at the back, but the camera island has a rounded design and is significantly bigger than last year. <br><br>That's down to the inclusion of the new tele lens, and while there are detractors to the design, I like it; the industrial design makes the phone stand out, and while the camera island could have looked better, it is quirky — and I enjoy that in a phone. The camera island juts out considerably, but because it's stretched across nearly the entire width at the back, there isn't any wobble when using the Phone 3a Pro on a table.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro next to Phone 3a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mNFgGHHBctwRRfRAmW8eSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing went with a glass back this time, noting that while the plastic back on the Phone 2a made the device lighter, it was prone to scratching. Nothing says its userbase wanted a glass back, so it catered to that demand. The glass is protected by a custom solution, and it is effective against tumbles.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Wvxf6GPuTu2uXSyy5QrNPC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro back view against red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wvxf6GPuTu2uXSyy5QrNPC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Also, the Phone 3a Pro looks much better in real life than the product renders would suggest, so if you're unsure about the device solely based on the design, I'd recommend going to a store and trying it out; Nothing sells the device via select big brand retail stores in India.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7WYmBpFe2GpkY2EhgSTeXC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro back view against red background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7WYmBpFe2GpkY2EhgSTeXC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, the LEDs at the back continue to be a major differentiator, and I like how this feature has evolved over the last two years. The three lighting zones don't cover much area — unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2-review">Phone 2</a> — but they're just as customizable. I'm using the grey color variant of the device, and while it isn't quite as striking as the blue model, it does a brilliant job accentuating the design.</p>

<p>What I like about the Phone 3a Pro is that it has an aluminum mid-frame with matte sides. This makes holding and using the phone that much easier, and it creates a much better in-hand feel. I'm still not a fan of the flat sides though, but Nothing is at least consistent in this regard. The phone has IP64 ingress protection, and Nothing says while it didn't get the Phone 3a Pro tested for IP65 or IP67, it should weather immersion in water — but without a rating, you lose any warranty due to water damage if you try.</p>
<h2 id="all-the-hardware-you-need-2">All the hardware you need</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro home page with custom icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Phone 3a Pro has a 6.77-inch AMOLED panel, and just like its predecessor, it has ultra-thin bezels on all sides. This is a minor point, but it is yet another area where Nothing's attention to detail makes the device stand out, and it's good to see the brand providing the same quality on its budget phones as its flagship.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4w3ztfnMGerqZeQQaFj4zC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4w3ztfnMGerqZeQQaFj4zC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, the panel has good colors and contrast, and the notable change this year is that it gets much brighter than the Phone 2a — this was immediately evident when using the device outdoors. I didn't see any issues while gaming or streaming media, and although the Phone 3a Pro doesn't quite have the same level of performance as a high-end device, it holds up incredibly well considering it's a budget phone. Thermals are handled much better, and it makes a noticeable difference in extended gaming sessions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9AYbG7cLnqx3bHpKniDrsC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9AYbG7cLnqx3bHpKniDrsC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The rest of the hardware is pretty standard; there's good connectivity, a decent vibration motor, and thanks to a 5000mAh battery, the phone lasts a day without any issues at all. The 50W charging tech means it takes just an hour to charge the Phone 3a Pro, and while it's annoying that you still don't get a charger in the box, it relies on the USB PD protocol, so you can use any charger with the device.</p>

<p>I enjoyed using the cameras on the Phone 2a last year, and this is an area where the Phone 3a Pro brings considerable upgrades. The 50MP Samsung GNJ main camera takes better images in low-light situations, and the new 50MP Sony LYT-600 tele lens is fantastic; it takes clear shots at 3x, and you get usable shots at up to 10x. Annoyingly, video is limited to 4K30, and you don't get 4K60 recording on the device. Video recording itself is pretty average, but that's the case with most budget devices.</p>
<h2 id="essential-software-2">Essential software</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro home page with custom icons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6gd4UfQYqtfMNMfTeYpHWC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A big part of the allure with Nothing's phones is the software. There just aren't enough budget phones with clean software, so Nothing's focus in this area is refreshing. The interface continues to be just as clean as previous years, and Nothing OS 3.1 has plenty of customizability. Nothing has a slate of exclusive widgets on its devices, and they combine great design with usability.</p>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>-based interface is fluid, and I enjoy using it quite a bit. While it isn't what I'd call vanilla Android, there's a distinct visual style, and unlike most other skins, the design doesn't feel cumbersome in the least. It's just enjoyable to use, and Nothing OS 3.1 continues to me one of my favorite Android interfaces.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RM78fHrvqgYTTZZWExpRUC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro software showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RM78fHrvqgYTTZZWExpRUC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An interesting addition this year is a button underneath the power button. This is to invoke Essential Space, a shelf that organizes all your screenshots, to-do lists, notes, voice memos, images, and more. A single press of the button lets you jot down a note, a long press lets you dictate a voice memo, and a double press launches the shelf. It is one of the best features on the Phone 3a Pro, and while it's still in its infancy — Nothing has ambitious plans for the feature — it's clear that it has great potential.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="w4kWfeWPMQeppDvSbUNbSC" name="Nothing Phone 3a Pro" alt="Nothing Phone 3a Pro software showcase" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w4kWfeWPMQeppDvSbUNbSC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nothing says Essential Space will be a differentiator on the Phone 3 that's slated to launch sometime later this year, but it didn't want to limit the mode to its flagship, so its debuting on the Phone 3a and 3a Pro. That's great to see, and honestly, it makes me question why other Android brands didn't come up with something similar until now.</p>

<p>The Phone 3a Pro costs ₹30,999 ($356) in India for the 8GB/128GB edition, and I know calling it a budget phone is dubious, but that's where the industry is headed. Phone prices are steadily on the rise, and decent budget phones cost nearly double what they used to just a few years ago. <br><br>That said, these phones have better hardware, elegant designs, and significantly better cameras. The Phone 3a Pro in particular proves that budget phones can be cool too, and the combination of unique design, clean software, and great cameras at the back make it the best choice in this category. There isn't another device that gives you quite as many features, and it's no wonder that Nothing is aggressively advertising the Phone 3a Pro in India — it knows it's onto something great.</p>

Since the phone runs Android 15 (with OxygenOS 15 overlay) out of the box, you can expect it to be <strong>updated to Android versions 16 through 19</strong>. After the last OS update, the OnePlus 13 will <strong>continue to get security patches for two more years</strong>.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-13-s-update-policy-is-good-but-it-could-and-should-be-better-2">The OnePlus 13's update policy is good, but it could (and should) be better</h2>
<p>It probably won't be an exaggeration to say that the OnePlus 13 is the best phone that the company has ever made. Building further upon the foundation laid by its already-excellent predecessor, OnePlus's newest top-of-the-line smartphone manages to get just about everything right. It's no wonder the OnePlus 13 earned a perfect score from Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich when he <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">reviewed</a> the phone.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 comes with a refreshed design that's a visual delight. Not just that, the "2.5D" curved edges of the front and back panels make it quite comfortable to hold as well. You have a choice of two materials (vegan leather and textured glass) for the rear and both look equally gorgeous. Oh, and you also have an IP69 certification, which is a first for any smartphone. Combined with that premium build quality and top-tier specs (as you'd expect), it's clear that the OnePlus 13 is a smartphone designed to last.</p><p>But even though the phone's hardware—both on the inside and the outside—is ready for the long haul, what about the software?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm" name="oneplus-13-blue-back-05" alt="The back of the Ocean blue OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J9XFDtGRdSeKW2TpmE4tQm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 runs Android 15 (with the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-used-oxygenos-15-for-a-week-these-are-my-favorite-features">Oxygen OS 15</a> overlay) out of the box, and OnePlus has committed to providing it four years of major OS updates. This means that it's on track to receive Android 16, 17, 18, and 19 in future. Once that's done, the phone will get security patches for two extra years. It's also worth mentioning that the exact same update policy applies to the OnePlus 13R too.</p><p>Now, this software update commitment doesn't sound all that bad, until you realize it doesn't come close to the seven years of major OS updates that Samsung and Google promise for their flagship smartphones. It probably would be alright if this was a mid-range smartphone like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-nord-4-review">OnePlus Nord 4</a> (which by the way, also benefits from the same update commitment), but it's not. The OnePlus 13 is a full-blown flagship having a starting price of $900, so we think it deserves more in terms of software support.</p><p>What's also worth noting is that the OnePlus 13 is fully capable of going much further as far as updates are concerned, since this thing is crammed with blazing-fast hardware. We're talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset, helped by up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM and up to 512GB of UFS 4.0 storage. You get a fabulous triple-lens rear camera setup, a 6,000mAh battery with incredible charging speeds, and much more. Sure, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-president-throws-shade-at-seven-years-of-updates">might think</a> a long software update commitment doesn't make sense, but it actually does, even more so when you're expected to shell out nearly a grand for a flagship.</p><p>When all is said and done, the OnePlus 13 is hands down one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> you can get in the market at this time. It ticks all the right boxes and is a phone we can recommend to anyone looking for a full-featured flagship. However, a longer update commitment would make the OnePlus 13 an even more astounding value buy than it already is.</p>

<p>As a smartphone startup in the 2020s, Nothing is trying to do the impossible by shaking up a huge established market, and it's starting with the midrange sector. Nothing's Phone 2a set the standard for what a midrange phone should be, and now the company is improving on that standard with the latest Nothing Phone 3a. It's only slightly more expensive than its predecessor, but offers a more complete package.</p><p>Neither phone is fully equipped for use in the U.S., as carrier support is limited and they are only sold via the Nothing Beta Program. However, both devices are ideal for regions like Europe and India. Starting at £329 or ₹24,999, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Nothing Phone 3a</a> offers an excellent value proposition. But how does it compare to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-2a-review">Nothing Phone 2a</a>? That's what we're going to find out in this comparison.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-phone-3a-vs-nothing-phone-2a-design-and-display-2">Nothing Phone 3a vs. Nothing Phone 2a: Design and display</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-3" alt="Photos of the Nothing Phone 3a series." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fv6mCkNhot9tpMDPii42Za.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 2a have a striking design, and they look quite similar. The two smartphones have a "camera island" with rear sensors positioned in the top center of their back. Of course, the Phone 3a's bigger lenses and triple camera system make that camera island look gigantic compared to that of the dual-camera Phone 2a.</p><p>The newer model is slightly larger than its predecessor, with the Phone 3a packing a 6.77-inch screen and the Phone 2a featuring a 6.7-inch display. They use similar display technologies, with support for 120Hz refresh rates and an OLED panel. However, the Phone 3a has an LTPO screen, which will result in smoother animations. Both phones support HDR10+ and have a peak brightness rating of 1,300 nits.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bigger and better theme of the Phone 3a makes it physically larger than the Phone 2a. It measures 163.52 x 77.5 x 8.35mm and weighs 201 grams, whereas the Phone 2a measures 161.7 x 76.3 x 8.6mm and weighs 190 grams. Like most 6.7-inch phones, the Phone 3a's size can feel like a burden at times, and you'll feel the weight. Overall, it's pretty similar to the Phone 2a in that regard.</p>

<p>Nothing also improved the durability of the Phone 3a, supporting IP64 for dust and water resistance. Oddly, the company switched from Gorilla Glass this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">using Panda Glass on the Phone 3a</a>. The important part is that Panda Glass is hardened, so it ideally won't crack easily, but some reports indicate Panda is easier to scratch than Gorilla.</p><p>By comparison, the Nothing Phone 2a features an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance, and Gorilla Glass 5.</p>

<p>Nothing made a big deal out of its switch from MediaTek to Qualcomm for its budget phones this year. The Nothing Phone 3a uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ai-is-coming-to-more-budget-phones-thanks-to-qualcomms-new-snapdragon-7s-gen-3">Qualcomm Snapdragon 7s Gen 3</a>, a budget chip recently optimized to improve AI performance. However, in benchmarks and real-world tests, we found that the Phone 3a is worse than the Phone 2a in gaming and graphics performance.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro chipset in the Nothing Phone 2a seems to perform better in graphics tasks, while falling to the Phone 3a in CPU-based tasks. In our review, our own Nicholas Sutrich found that there was a 30-40% drop in benchmark FPS on the Phone 3a compared to the Phone 2a. This was reflected in real-world tests, too, even affecting relatively light games like Minecraft.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.77%;"><img id="9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-nothing-phone-3a-minecraft-gaming-performance" alt="Comparing game performance in Minecraft between the Nothing Phone 3a/3a Pro and the Nothing Phone 2a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9yrBEFUbpZbEiQpCsCoKbn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With that being said, both phones performed great in daily use. They can each be configured with 8GB or 12GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage, but some configurations are only available in certain regions. In terms of battery, both phones have a 5,000mAh capacity. The Nothing Phone 3a charges slightly faster, with 50W support compared to the Phone 2a's 45W support.</p>

<p>With the Phone 3a, Nothing is promising three full OS upgrades and six total years of security patches. It's starting with Nothing OS 3.1, which is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> and includes all the latest AI features from Nothing, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/nothing-essential-space-ai-hub-what-pixel-screenshots-should-have-been">including the Essential Space</a>. Although the Phone 2a got the Nothing OS 3 update, it won't get all the new AI features. Its last platform update will be Android 17, so it still has plenty of support left.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UKRGdfGSJsqZGb2ePj9GoD" name="nothing-phone-3a-camera" alt="The camera viewfinder on the Nothing Phone (3a)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UKRGdfGSJsqZGb2ePj9GoD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For the first time, Nothing is offering a telephoto lens on the Nothing Phone 3a. For the regular Phone 3a, the 50MP f/2.0 Samsung telephoto camera only does 2x optical zoom, but it's better than nothing. The main camera is a 50MP f/1.88 Samsung sensor with a 1/1.57-inch sensor size, and it includes optical image stabilization. The third camera is an 8MP, f/2.2 Sony ultrawide camera with a 120-degree field of view.</p><p>Even without support for a high level of optical zoom, the telephoto lens in the Nothing Phone 3a helps it produce better zoom shots than its predecessor, as you can see in the image samples below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:9216px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.33%;"><img id="ra3iqjqy2vG5A5vsU65GEC" name="nothing-phone-2a-vs-phone-3a-vs-phone-3a-pro-camera-comparison-6x-01" alt="Comparing camera quality between the Nothing Phone 2a, Phone 3a, and Phone 3a Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ra3iqjqy2vG5A5vsU65GEC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="9216" height="4731" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Nothing Phone 2a has a 50MP, f/1.9 Samsung GN9 main sensor that's very similar to the one on the Phone 3a. Notably, it still supports OIS and 4K30 video recording. That's paired with a 50MP, f/2.2 Samsung JN1 wide-angle lens with an 84.5-degree field of view.</p><p>On the front, both phones feature 32MP, f/2.2 cameras — more than good enough to snap all the selfies you need.</p>

<p>If you're in the market for a budget Android phone, the Nothing Phone 3a makes a compelling case. It's better than the cheapest Samsung Galaxy A series phones, and it's cheaper than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Google Pixel 8a</a> — and the rumored Pixel 9a, for that matter. Due to the Nothing Phone 2a's limited availability, you won't find much of a discount on last-generation hardware. That's why the Phone 3a is our pick if you had to choose between it and the Phone 2a.</p><p>With that being said, the Phone 2a is still a worthy pick for a daily driver in 2025. The Phone 2a is still fast and runs the latest OS — it's even faster than the Phone 3a in graphics performance. For the Nothing Phone 2a owners out there, an upgrade to the Phone 3a isn't necessary.</p>

<ul><li>Fitbit seems to have filed another patent for measuring blood pressure on a future wearable.</li><li>Fitbit's previous patent to measure the same metric was rejected previously, and it looks like the company hasn't given up.</li><li>The company wants to achieve a non-invasive way to measure blood pressure, which it could achieve if the said wearable would carry both pressure and optical sensors.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>It looks like Fitbit is working on a non-invasive way to track people's blood pressure with a future wearable.</p><p>The latest patent (patent no. 12,239,424 B2) submitted by the company revealed plans for a wearable being loaded with biometric sensors that could track changes in blood flow and artery stiffness (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gadgetsandwearables.com/2025/03/09/fitbit-patent-blood-pressure/" target="_blank">as first spotted by Gadgets and Wearables</a>).</p><p>Generally, blood pressure is monitored using a cuff-like device that tightens to detect the flow of blood and then releases the grip to give the user their readings. To be able to achieve it on a fitness-tracking wearable seems like reaching for the moon.</p><p>However, the publication adds that Fitbit goes into the weeds about this possible feature. The patent states that the device will have a mix of pressure sensors and optical sensors embedded within the wearable which could either be a smartwatch or a smart ring. In fact, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbits-smart-ring-patent-is-just-the-beginning">previous rumors indicate</a> that the company could be working on a smart ring that would be built to track blood pressure, glucose, lipids, hemoglobin, and your diet, along with other fitness metrics.</p>

<p>This leads us to believe that the recent patent could be talking about the smart ring as well. Ideally, the wearable should have either a band or sensors that could track fluctuations in blood flow or artery stiffness.</p><p>"The filing describes a system where sensors press against the skin and detect small mechanical changes caused by blood moving through the arteries," the publication added. This would have to work in tandem with the usual PPG sensors that smartwatches have that use light to measure blood flow and pressure. The wearable would combine both readings to provide an accurate blood pressure metric.</p>

<p>But how would a wearable such as a smartwatch or ring achieve the tightening of a traditional BP machine, you ask? The patent answers that, too. It says that "Fitbit’s wearable could use inflatable or mechanically controlled elements to apply pressure to the skin on a much smaller scale." This makes it a bit less likely that it could be a smart ring.</p><p>Still, this isn't the first time that Fitbit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US390993028&_cid=P21-LDSXWU-06214-1">has filed such a patent<em>.</em> </a>In 2023, we saw something similar, where an FDA-approved watch band would turn into an inflatable one to measure blood pressure, as seen below. However, that didn't show up on the subsequent Fitbit watches.</p>

<p>Patents are filed by companies all the time for out-of-the-box features, but that doesn't mean it would show up on the actual device. However, if it does show up on the wearable, it would have an upper hand over other competitors on the market.</p>

<hr>
<p>Samsung is pushing an update for its demo-focused app that might generate some hype around its major Android update.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/try-galaxy-app-simulates-one-ui-7-s25-series/">SamMobile</a> highlights a recent update to the Try Galaxy app that lets users on past-gen Galaxy devices, and other Android phones, demo One UI 7's features. The app's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://trygalaxy.com/">official page</a> reflects its recent update of Samsung's upcoming Android 15-based update. For what to expect, Try Galaxy will simulate some of the newest core systems on your device, like the Now Brief.</p><p>The publication's test details a the Now Brief widget is available in this app's demo for your home screen. The small, pill-shaped widget displays some quick information externally before expanding fully once tapped. This experience is exactly what you'd see on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>. Users tapping the widget will receive a simulated briefing packed with weather information, your "schedule," and more.</p><p>The playtest also gives users a taste of Samsung's quick panel overhaul. The Quick Settings panel and your notifications panel are now separate in One uI 7. This was something the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-changes-teased-sdc-2024">teased during SDC 2024</a> before it debuted on the latest flagship trio.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:47.90%;"><img id="ea9FbefoXEsevd7fnGAgP3" name="samsung-try-galaxy-one-ui-7-app-update" alt="Samsung has updated its Try Galaxy app with a simulation of One UI 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ea9FbefoXEsevd7fnGAgP3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1192" height="571" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The One UI 7 simulation also features some smaller software pieces like Samsung's complete icon rework. Galaxy's upcoming app drawer redesign is also included in the Try Galaxy demo, per the publication. Users can head to the official website, scan the QR code, and begin downloading the simulation on Android and iOS.</p><p>Funnily enough, Samsung's Try Galaxy app was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-app-update">only available for Apple's iPhones</a> as a way to, well, get them to switch. The app would simulate the Android experience on its recent smartphones and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-app-foldable-features-update">even its foldables</a>.</p><p>However, the company finally brought its Try Galaxy app <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-try-galaxy-android-galaxy-ai-demo">to Android users</a>. The move was made as Samsung stepped into its "era of mobile AI." Many of the core Galaxy AI features were present during that test, as well as the company's One UI 6.1 update for interested users. The Galaxy AI playtest let users experiment with Live Translate, Note Assist, and Chat Assist among others.</p><p>As if we needed to be more ready for One UI 7, this Try Galaxy update is rolling out (perhaps) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">a month before</a> the software goes live. Samsung recently confirmed that, after a series of critical delays, One UI 7 should launch for eligible Galaxy devices in April. Meanwhile, it just started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-rollout">its first beta program</a> for the Flip 6 and Fold 6.</p>

<ul><li>Google highlighted issues users have reported with media texts for RCS chats in Messages.</li><li>The company is rolling out a few updates for Messages that should solve media reception "slowdowns" and "failures" that users have recently reported.</li><li>Google recently brought enhanced scam detection measures to Messages and the Phone app in its March feature drop for Pixels.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users should soon find relief for a recent string of issues plaguing RCS texts in the Messages app.</p><p>In a recent Google Messages <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/messages/thread/330404133?hl=en">community post</a>, the company highlighted that it has started addressing instances of failed media texts in RCS chats (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/google-messages-media-receiving/">9to5Google</a>). The community manager states Google's team has been "actively working" toward a fix and several updates are being rolled out to (hopefully) solve the problem. Google is specifically targeting "receiving performance."</p><p>Aside from text failures, Google is also looking at tackling media text "slowdowns," which should help your device download media (image/videos) at a more acceptable speed. The thread states that these updates should provide a "noticeable difference;" however, the current wave of patches might not solve everything.</p><p>Google notes how complex these issues are and users who are still experiencing problems should let them know.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH" name="pixel-google-messages-oops.jpg" alt="Pixel Google Messages Oops" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q5z7wdpDeFQNn6hVd5hTpH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There's speculation that the updates Google is rolling out are server-side improvements — which would make sense. However, keep your eyes peeled in case something more substantial arrives via a Play Store update.</p><p>The media issues are a sore spot on an otherwise useful Google Messages update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">dropped at the beginning</a> of March. The company recently rolled out its feature drop for Pixels, which brought enhanced scam protection measures to the Messages and Phone app. Each app leverages Google's AI to automatically detect and flag potential malicious users. For texts, the AI will scan messages for "commonly associated with scams" and alert you to them within the thread.</p><p>Users can quickly report and block that user without a second thought to protect your data.</p><p>Meanwhile, we're still awaiting Google's promised <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-announces-911-rcs-texting-to-android">911 RCS texting</a> capabilities with authorities. The company first teased this feature last summer, stating users could text emergency services and send them videos/images to help the location efforts. While this was planned for "the winter," we might be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-911-rcs-support-nearly-ready-detailed">much closer to it</a> than we think.</p>

According to Mint, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/"><strong>the offers that have been dominating the airwaves recently — such as $400 off the Google Pixel 9 with half off one year of Unlimited</strong></a> — are only guaranteed to run through March 31st, which means this could be your last chance to save big on some of our favorite flagship phones when you bundle your wireless. </p><p>Now, to be fair, there&apos;s always a chance that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> will be extended beyond that cutoff date (fingers crossed), but if you&apos;ve had your eye on this promo for a while, I wouldn&apos;t wait. The sale primarily consists of major deals on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, so let&apos;s take a look at some of the best offers available at Mint (while we still can). </p>

<p>Arguably the best Google Pixel 9 deal ever released, this offer gives you 50% off both the flagship phone AND a full year of wireless service on Mint Mobile's Unlimited plan. In other words, you could get an excellent AI-powered smartphone and 12 months of great wireless for just $579. That's less than it would cost to buy the Pixel 9 alone!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9/6810275/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9b9d5555-12b0-416f-840d-cb179f050c46" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$799" data-dimension48="$799">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>If the base model Pixel 9 doesn't have enough power for you, upgrade to the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> and you'll get a straight $400 discount alongside one year of the Unlimited plan for just $180 when you bundle. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/google-pixel-9-pro-xl/6810506/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="09772d1c-cc6e-47d2-988e-ee95694e8412" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,099" data-dimension48="$1,099">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The Galaxy S25 lineup just dropped last month, but you can already score a $200 discount when you buy the base model flagship with one year of the Unlimited plan at Mint. As with the other deals on this list, your wireless will also drop down to just $180 (or $15 per month using affirm).<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25/8666515/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="7b1c2516-61f3-4501-94d7-a3a8a4ea62bd" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy S25 128GB: $800" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy S25 128GB: $800">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> is huge, powerful, and unfortunately, quite expensive, which is why we're excited to see Mint Mobile carve $200 off the phone when you bundle the purchase with one year of the Unlimited plan. Your T-Mobile-powered wireless will also drop to just $180, which is like getting a 50% discount for a full year!<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.mintmobile.com/devices/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra/8666710/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5fc68653-64e3-4140-a21d-2a23e8d2a1b6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,300" data-dimension48="$1,300">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/328790190/google-pixel-watch-update-march-2025?hl=en">Wear OS 5.1 community post</a> only scratches the surface of the new features it brings to Pixel Watches. But since I'm <em>still</em> waiting one week later for my Pixel Watch 3 LTE to receive the update, I'm pivoting from my planned hands-on to focus on one small but important note that you probably missed: Google is switching to quarterly Wear OS updates, and it's probably for the best.</p><p>We knew that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5#section-wear-os-5-1">Wear OS 5.1</a> would add backend improvements like a credentials manager API and a watch-speaker option for apps so they can read out fitness instructions or sound an alarm without earbuds. And <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-interview-dr-jacqueline-shreibati-on-pixel-watch-loss-of-pulse-and-ai-diagnoses">Loss of Pulse</a> is coming soon, but that's somewhat unrelated to 5.1.</p><p>The community post changelog is fairly short, with an improved step count algorithm in specific cases like pushing a shopping cart, stroller, or wheelchair; easier menstrual health logging in Fitbit; and auto-bedtime mode on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Pixel Watch 2</a> (though not the original Watch yet). You also get a few <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch/2025/2025-03-01">key high and moderate security patches</a>.</p><p>Beyond these, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/wear-os-5-1-new-features/">9to5Google</a> has logged other changes spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> owners, like a developer option to "Force Global AOD" on apps, a new accent color for the UI, and a new Modes menu consolidating DND, Bedtime, and Theater in one place.</p><p>In other words, it's a subtly significant set of updates, which may explain why we've been stuck on the November update for so long. And Google wants us to get used to waiting: the community post states that "our next planned update will target June 2025, and <strong>quarterly thereafter</strong>" (emphasis mine).</p>

<p>Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-wear-os-5-problems-force-pause">roll back Wear OS 5</a> on older Pixel Watches in September — taking about six weeks to fix it — and hasn't released a new patch since November 2024. Even then, the company was starting to shift its update strategy with the Pixel Watch, announcing that the next update wouldn't arrive until four months later, in March 2025.</p><p>It's a noticeable change from the last couple of years, and this new quarterly pivot seems to suggest that Google has decided monthly updates aren't necessary anymore.</p><p>Since the first Pixel Watch launched in October 2022, Google has updated Pixel Watches to match the monthly Pixel updates. So, I checked all 24 Pixel Watch update community posts from November 2022 onward to see how many made <em>significant</em> feature changes.</p><p>Google made small Fitbit app changes in November 2022 and bug fixes in December. In 2023, nine out of the 12 monthly updates only had security fixes and/or bug fixes (mostly security). Outside of Wear OS 4 in October 2023, only one update (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-march-2023-update">March 2023</a>) added significant new features. Essentially, not much changed between versions.</p><p>In 2024, five out of the ten updates focused solely on security. Google was a little more ambitious with new Google Maps and Fitbit features in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-march-2024-update">March 2024</a>, improved haptics and auto-brightness in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-april-2024-update-rollout">April 2024</a>, and better crash/ fall detection and on-wrist detection in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-watch-and-pixel-watch-2-june-2024-update">June 2024</a>. However, most of these coincided with broader Pixel feature drops. Both September and November 2024 focused on Wear OS 5, but November was a last-gen do-over with no new Watch 3 features.</p><p>With this new quarterly schedule, we can expect new feature drops in June, September, and December 2025. I can't say for certain why Google has chosen this option, but I'm fairly confident that this could be a good thing for Pixel Watch owners — if Google handles them well.</p>

<p>It's a bit unfortunate that Pixel Watch owners accustomed to monthly security patches will now have to wait three months between hotfixes. However, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/wear">Wear OS security bulletins</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch">Pixel Watch security bulletins</a> only ever have a couple of issues to resolve per month, compared to the dozens per month you see on Android phones. Some months, there aren't any significant fixes at all, and very few are ever "critical."</p><p>The point is that I don't necessarily see an urgent need for monthly patches simply for the sake of aligning their updates with Pixel phones. Instead of focusing on making stable, consistent changes every month, it seems more productive to me if they make four <em>substantial</em> changes per year.</p><p>We now know that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> should arrive in September 2025 after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a> launch. Allegedly, Gemini will replace Google Assistant as the default assistant, which is a fairly significant change. So I'd rather Google's team have three months to prepare for this update than waste time on trivial updates in the interim.</p>

<p>I also think Google should consider offering beta Wear OS testing on the Pixel Watch, as Samsung does with One UI Watch, as a way to root out issues ahead of time. Having preset quarterly updates will give its engineers more buffer time to catch them and avoid another frustrating rollback, too.</p><p>Basically, I'm looking for the silver lining in what many Pixel Watch owners might consider bad news. Whether the next June 2025 update is called "Wear OS 5.2" or not, it should be more substantial than the typical, perfunctory updates we used to get. And I assume my monthly Pixel phone patches will catch the bulk of any security vulnerabilities.</p><p>But if Google can't live up to its quarterly schedule or still releases buggy updates, then that'll certainly be a bad sign. We'll see what the rest of 2025 brings for Pixel Watch owners!</p>

<ul><li>Reports claim Samsung is moving into the mass production stage of its new fourth-generation 4nm chips, codename "SF4X."</li><li>Sources claim the company has created its most "advanced" 4nm chip with a strong focus on AI for various companies globally.</li><li>Other Samsung chip rumors speculate about its Exynos 2600 SoC, which could find its way into the Galaxy S26.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Reports claim Samsung is kickstarting its development plan for a new generation of chips to propel its Foundry business.</p><p>Claims that Samsung has started mass producing its next-gen 4nm process chips stem from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://zdnet.co.kr/view/?no=20250311174600">ZDNet Korea</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-starts-mass-production-fourth-generation-4nm-chips/">SamMobile</a>). According to the publication's sources, the process, known as "SF4X," is viewed by Samsung as a "key weapon" for its Foundry business. The Korean OEM is reportedly looking to gain ground in the SoC manufactuering business after falling behind the likes of TSMC.</p><p>What's more, AI seems to be at the core of Samsung's next 4nm process iteration. An alleged "insider" informed the publication the company's new node is its "most advanced."</p><p>Since the node's first production run in 2021, the SF4X has supposedly improved its subsequent writing process, as well as introducing high-speed transistors. Samsung is also looking to support next-gen "packaging technologies" via 2.5D and 3D. Samsung has reportedly "stabilized" the rumored 4nm process chip's yield, meaning its production <em>should </em>be decent.</p><p>The company is said to be in good spirits about this, considering it has "failed to secure major customers" like Qualcomm and Apple, per reports. Samsung is reportedly interested in selling its 4nm chip to companies "around the world." The post adds Samsung has an ongoing contract with X for its AI Grok for its 4nm process chip.</p>

<p>While Samsung first started producing 4nm chips in 2021, it wasn't until 2022 when the product <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/galaxy-s22s-4nm-chip-isnt-noticeably-faster-it-wins-other-areas">became mainstream</a> — and plugged into the Galaxy S22. However, during Android Central's original overview of the chip, it didn't provide a noteworthy boost to the phone that you'd write home about. A slight performance boost was noted, thanks to Samsung's 4nm SoC, but its impact wasn't profound in day-to-day usage.</p><p>Some of the primary strengths were in the imaging department when taking photos. Jump to the present day and we're seeing rumors of more AI focus and application for companies with large AI models instead of handheld devices.</p><p>On the other hand, we have rumors that Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-2600-chip-urgent-push-reported">is pushing forward</a> with its next 2nm process chip, the Exynos 2600. The company is reportedly expressing "urgency" behind the production of this new chip and has even created a "performance improvement task force" to address concerns.</p><p>Not only does Samsung want to ensure the Exynos 2600 is stable, but it also wants to secure performance competitiveness when standing against others in the industry. Rumors suggest this chip could find its way into the Galaxy S26 series next year.</p>

<p>Samsung's Project Moohan XR Headset has been the talk of the town lately after it was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-to-give-us-a-closer-look-at-android-xr-headset">showcased more vividly</a> at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC 2025</a> in Barcelona.</p><p>When Samsung first showed off only the headset at Unpacked, it also confirmed that it would come with full support for hand tracking and eye tracking, as well as motion-based controllers. However, while the company plans on launching it sometime this year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-xr-headset-controllers-model-number/">SamMobile</a> seems to have spotted references to what appears to be first-party controllers for the headset.</p>

<p>According to the publication, Samsung appears to be making first-party motion controllers for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-glasses">Project Moohan</a>. They even seemed to have spotted a model number for them: <strong>ET-OI610</strong>.</p><p>That will help with motion sensing for those who use the headset for mixed-reality gaming, much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a>. That said, the device is built to come with eye and hand tracking as well.</p><p>What we don't know yet is if these controllers will come coupled with the XR headset. If not, Samsung is likely to put an additional price tag on these controllers, much like the Apple Vision Pro. However, if Samsung wants to one-up Apple, it should bundle these controllers with the headset like the other competitors.</p><p>If they do sell it as a separate accessory, it would only mean that the headset would work fine without controllers, only based on other motion gestures. That said, so far, we know that Samsung's XR headset will be powered by Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/qualcomm-snapdragon-xr2-plus-gen-2-announced-for-samsung-headset">Snapdragon XR2 Plus Gen 2</a>. The headset is said to come with pancake lenses that deliver a high-resolution, clear XR experience.</p><p>Google also hinted that the XR headset could be powered by Gemini for multimodal communication. The tech giant said, "You can talk to your device as if you were talking to someone in the physical world."</p><p>Samsung's XR headset could be priced at around $1,500 or less, according to our Wearables lead Michael Hicks. It remains to be seen when Samsung will finally reveal all the specs of Project Moohan, although we're hoping it will come through at the next Unpacked event, which may happen this summer.</p>

<ul><li>Telegram’s latest update includes the ability to cast videos on Chromecast-supported devices.</li><li>The other new features give content creators and public figures more control over their privacy and monetize their popularity.</li><li>They can filter out unwanted messages and put a fee for people who message them outside their contacts.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Telegram has announced a bunch of new features for the messaging platform, including the ability to cast videos to TVs for Android phone users.</p><p>According to the latest<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/star-messages-gateway-2-0-and-more"> blog post</a>, shared videos on Telegram can be viewed on TVs as the messaging platform gains support for Chromecast devices. It could likely work with smart TVs that already support Chromecast sharing.</p>
<p>“Android users can now cast videos straight to their Chromecast devices — whether you're watching memes with friends or presenting important content in a meeting, enjoy it all on the big screen!”</p><p>Casting a video also appears hassle-free as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users need to open a video on the Telegram app, select the Settings icon on the top right, and look for the Chromecast option. It is pretty similar to what we are used to on other streaming apps like YouTube or Netflix, for instance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:942px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.69%;"><img id="dBPTzpS2TSgGM3frYx9EyN" name="Telegram-video-Chromecast" alt="Telegram video chromecast feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dBPTzpS2TSgGM3frYx9EyN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="942" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the ability to cast videos, other features of the messaging platform are tailored for content creators and public figures. They are privacy-focused and also offer new ways to monetize their popularity.</p><p>As prominent figures receive numerous messages daily, they can now set a fee for incoming messages from people who are not on their contacts list. It further allows them to earn Stars as well. Additionally, they can filter out unwanted messages, and strangers can contact them only when they are willing to share Stars.</p><p>Telegram says these new features can be applied to group chats and channel discussions as it lets interactions stay focused and free from spam.</p><p>Furthermore, when someone tries to contact a user for the first time, Telegram will provide a new detailed info page that showcases information like country, shared groups, their Telegram joining date, and other such essential details, which further help in tackling spam and avoid impersonators.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="mT9Wqx7ZBqZJGaCyXHnygB" name="Telegram-Gateway-authentication" alt="Telegram Gateway Authentication" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mT9Wqx7ZBqZJGaCyXHnygB.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lastly, Telegram Gateway is a cost-effective and privacy-focused solution from the messaging platform that offers user authentication. It allows users to verify their customers’ phone numbers through Telegram. The aim is to replace standard SMS verification, and it “elsewhere can cost $0.50 or more per message, while Telegram Gateway offers authentication for just $0.01.”</p>

We've reached a point where just about every launch event is accompanied by a promo video that's been recorded using whatever phone is being announced.</p><p>This continued with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> despite the only change being an upgraded 50MP ultrawide lens. It also marks the third year that Samsung has relied on the 200MP ISOCELL HP2 as its primary lens. Even still, Samsung's flagship devices are regularly touted as being among the best for mobile photography.</p><p>So, with that in mind, we decided to put those claims to the test against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. I also included the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a> just to see whether it's really worth upgrading, purely for the cameras.</p><p>Before diving in, I want to assure you that all of the pictures you see were taken with the default settings. The images were not manipulated in any way, as to provide as balanced of a comparison as possible.</p>

<p>Kicking things off, I compared the two phones that will likely dominate the market in 2025: the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the iPhone 16 Pro Max. The first picture in the gallery makes use of the ultrawide lens from both devices, with the iPhone definitely having a warmer tone.</p><p>Besides that, the pictures look fairly similar, capturing the same amount of detail. I have to admit that it was pretty darn cool being able to see the S25 Ultra manage to capture the bird as it was flying in front of me in the top right corner.</p><p>In the picture of the birds mostly chilling on the dock, the S25 Ultra again produced a "cooler" image than the iPhone. However, the iPhone's picture is a bit brighter, making it a bit easier to notice a few more details. That being said, there's nothing quite like capturing a bird as it takes off, and it was pure luck that I was able to get this image from the Ultra.</p><p>If you can't tell, there's a recurring theme with these phones, with the iPhone producing warmer tones, even if just slightly. Such is the case with the pictures in front of Tudor Hall here in St. Mary's County. There's really not much else to say here other than that I'm pretty happy with both phones so far.</p>

<p>With this image from the Tudor Hall Garden, it was the first time I noticed that the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed a brighter image. It's kind of a difficult picture to process, with the glare from the sunset affecting both phones in some capacity.</p><p>The thing about taking pictures on your phone is that they can look pretty good on smaller screens. However, after seeing the iPhone's picture of the sundial, I was surprised to see that it just... doesn't look good. There aren't nearly as many details as the S25 Ultra, which becomes apparent when looking at the hedges surrounding the sundial.</p><p>With the last image above, we have another difficult scenario to process. Not only is the sun setting, but the lights from the restaurant are all over the place. When you start trying to pixel-peep, the iPhone actually captures more detail, especially if you look at the "OPEN" sign on the right side of the pictures. However, I'd have to say that the Galaxy S25 Ultra managed to take a picture that better resembled what I was actually seeing.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the Galaxy S25 Ultra was given a chance to really flex its muscles a bit. Both phones were set to 25x zoom, as that's as far as the iPhone's digital zoom will let you go. Looking at the plaque, the text is legible in the iPhone's picture, but it looks a lot like it was generated by AI. Meanwhile, that's not even close to being the case with the S25 Ultra, as it's obvious that Samsung has the upper hand when it comes to telephoto images.</p>

<p>When you're walking around trying to take pictures with four <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">different phones</a>, there's really not much time to analyze what you've captured. At the moment, I didn't realize how similar the pictures are between the Pixel 9 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max. Even while I was putting together the side-by-side examples, I ended up needing to double-check the pictures just to make sure I wasn't messing anything up.</p><p>In fact, a lot of what I said about the iPhone's pictures in the previous section rings true about the Pixel 9 Pro. And that includes the picture of the birds on the dock, as it's brighter than the picture from the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>However, unlike the iPhone, I was actually able to capture the bird spreading its wings before taking off. Considering that both Samsung and Google have had issues with moving subjects, I couldn't be happier to see the improvements made culminating in what we have now.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why a couple of the comparison pictures are different here than the other sections, your guess is as good as mine. When I went back to try and find the pictures on the Pixel, they apparently yeeted themselves from the phone. Thankfully, I took plenty of other pictures to make up for that, but I still don't know what could've happened.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Pixel 9 Pro manages to keep up with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, producing images that are both crisp and clean. And while the S25 Ultra looked more "true to life" with the picture of the bar, the Pixel 9 Pro did the same with the image of Duke's.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9jBYuwcWPWqgWqy6RkXRt4" name="s25-ultra-vs-pixel-9-pro-8" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra camera versus the Google Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jBYuwcWPWqgWqy6RkXRt4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for the telephoto digital zoom test, it again was done at 25x in order to keep things the same across all of the devices. That's despite the Pixel 9 Pro and its Super Res Zoom being capable of delivering a 30x digital zoom.</p><p>One thing that surprised me about the Pixel 9 Pro is that it managed to make the text on the plaque look both less and more AI-enhanced than the S25 Ultra. There are some artifacts around some of the letters, but the 9 Pro also makes it look like someone went and traced over the words to make them appear bolder. Even still, I was quite impressed with how things turned out, as everything is clear and legible.</p>

<p>The last phone that I compared the Galaxy S25 Ultra to was its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra. On paper, the only difference between the two is the former features a 50MP telephoto lens compared to the 10MP sensor on the latter. In theory, that should mean that we end up with pictures that look more similar than the other phones.</p><p>And for the most part, that's exactly what we have here. Even in the third image, with both devices using 25x zoom, you'd have a tough time telling them apart if I didn't tell you which picture came from which phone.</p>

<p>If you need any more proof that these phones are using identical hardware, it doesn't get much better than the gallery of images above. With the exception of the sundial, the garden and front of Tudor Hall look practically identical. The differences are even more subtle than I thought they would be, which should make those who decided against upgrading feel good about the decision.</p>

<p>That being said, the super zoom comparison tells a different tale. It was almost like the Galaxy S24 Ultra didn't even try to sharpen the image at all. Instead, it almost feels as though it softened the picture. In fact, the S24 Ultra was the only phone of the four to do this, which definitely surprised me.</p><p>For the sake of full disclosure, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is currently running the latest One UI 7 beta. Seeing as the software isn't yet final, there's a non-zero chance that the beta software played a part in how this image was processed.</p>

<p>Something strange, for me at least, when I was on my way back home. For the first time ever, I actually pulled off to the side of the road to take a picture.</p><p>After the weather being quite uncooperative for the past couple of weeks, it was refreshing to have the clouds break and the sun shine through. Add in the fact that the time between sunset and dusk happens to be my favorite time to take pictures, on top of the clouds still clearing out, and it was just one of those "man, the sky looks beautiful moments."</p><p>So, I pulled over the car, rolled down the window, and just wanted to see whether any of these phones could recapture what I was seeing.</p>

<p>Out of all four phones that I used after pulling off to the side of the road, I think that the Pixel 9 Pro was the best. There are more details in the clouds, along with more vibrant colors that don't look fake.</p><p>While the iPhone seemingly managed to capture more light, the sunset fell victim to Apple's image processing. On the flip side, it's obvious to me that Samsung has made some substantial tweaks to the image tuning with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.</p><p>When looking at the two Ultra pictures side-by-side, it just feels like something is off with the S24 Ultra. Again, we might just have to chalk this up to the One UI 7 beta, but we won't be able to know for sure until the final version is released.</p>

<p>Without burying the lede, I honestly think you couldn't go wrong with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Pixel 9 Pro, or iPhone 16 Pro Max. Unless Samsung manages to work some magic with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-beta-2-hands-on">One UI 7</a>, I don't think the Galaxy S24 Ultra does enough to warrant consideration when it comes to more difficult photos.</p><p>However, while I can't pick one device over the other, there is something that helps the Galaxy S25 Ultra stand out. Navigating through Samsung's Camera app is a much easier experience than the others.</p><p>Not in terms of just being able to take out your phone and snap a picture. But in actually trying to adjust the zoom, making sure all of your settings are correct, and giving you access to the bucket of tools that Samsung provides. If you just want a point-and-shoot camera, you'll be fine no matter what phone you decide on.</p><p>But if you care about more than tapping the shutter button, then Samsung is the clear winner. This might not be the case forever as Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-camera-9-8-rolls-out-alongside-the-march-feature-drop-with-new-tweaks">continues to make improvements</a> to its own Camera app. So we'll have to see what the future could bring.</p>

<ul><li>The Retroid Pocket Classic has been officially announced, with most of its specs being revealed.</li><li>This upcoming retro handheld will feature a 3.92-inch AMOLED display, and is powered by a "Qualcomm 4nm" chip.</li><li>Retroid has yet to share pricing or exactly what processor the Pocket Classic will feature, but it could be the Snadragon 4 Gen 2.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Late last month, Retroid announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/retroid-pocket-flip-2-launch">Pocket Flip 2</a>, a clamshell handheld powered by Android. At the time, a second device was seen in the original announcement renders, but no other details were provided. Now, not only do we know that the Retroid Pocket Classic is on the way, but the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.com/channels/899605564361953300/1339770266544508958/1348845614393327637">recently revealed</a> most of its specs.</p><p>The most surprising aspect of the Pocket Classic is that Retroid is set to use a 3.92-inch AMOLED display with a 1240 x 1080 resolution. Most of the time, these retro handhelds rely on panels from older devices, and that's likely the case here. Rumors suggest that Retroid is sourcing display panels from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/lg-wing-review">LG Wing</a>, which is a blast from the past in its own right.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2888px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="JqpZs5w4bxPKvhyaUorLrQ" name="retroid-pocket-classic-specs-render" alt="Retroid Pocket Classics specs overview" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JqpZs5w4bxPKvhyaUorLrQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2888" height="1625" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Retroid)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides that, Retroid shared that the handheld is equipped with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of expandable storage, and it even ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a>. Not to mention that it comes with a huge 5,000mAh battery and active cooling, which is honestly a bit of a shock.</p><p>Once released, we'll have a total of six different color options to choose from, each of which pays homage to various consoles from our childhood. There is one that stands out from the rest, as the "Classic 6" is modeled after the Sega Saturn and is the only one to include six buttons. The other five models all sport the traditional four-button ABXY layout.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI0pi-TlmaA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>We don't exactly know why, but Retroid stopped short of naming the specific chip that it plans to use with its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">gaming handheld</a>. Instead, the marketing material only says that it's a "Qualcomm 4nm" processor. After doing a bit of research, we could be looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-4-gen-2-launch">Snapdragon 4 Gen 2</a>, a processor released in 2023 and is found in a lot of great budget phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmi-12-5g-review">Redmi 12 5G</a>, Poco M7, and others.</p><p>Unfortunately, we also don't yet know what Retroid plans to price the Pocket Classic at. Based on the specs and the lack of any joysticks, which puts a ceiling on what systems you can comfortably enjoy, we wouldn't be surprised if it comes in around $150.</p><p>Then again, this is the first vertical handheld from the company since the original Retroid Pocket was released in 2019. That handheld launched at $99, so if Retroid wanted to get a bit "cute," we wouldn't put it past them to open pre-orders for the Pocket Classic at that price.</p>

At first glance, we see the end-to-end screen on the device,  showcasing rounded corners and slightly thicker bezels.</p><p>This device looks like a mid-range, sub-flagship model, unlike the more budget G models from the company. Furthermore, it looks like this new Edge Stylus will be available globally.</p><p>In other news, European prices for the Moto G 60 Edge lineup showed up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_edge_60_stylus_render_shows_that_moto_is_bringing_the_stylus_to_the_midrange-news-66890.php">in a recent leak</a>.

While it didn't mention a Stylus model, it could be placed somewhere closer to the Edge 60 in terms of price range, according to GSMArena.</p><p>Previous leaks on the Moto G 60 trio don't mention a stylus model either. Recently, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/motorola-edge-60-series-moto-g56-g86-global-pricing-leaked/">91Mobiles</a> leaked alleged colorways the trio could launch with. The publication states that the Edge 60 Fusion could come in Blue and Grey, the Edge 60 could be seen in green and sea blue, while the Pro version will have three colorways: Blue, Grape, and Green colors, all with 8GB or 12GB RAM and 256GB storage.</p>

<p>However, in a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1899511260959641886">post</a>, Evan Blass showed a few pictures of the alleged Moto Edge 60 Fusion showcased in official marketing pictures. The pictures indicate that the device will launch in three colorways that differ from what 91Mobiles stated. As seen above</p><p>There was still no mention of the Stylus model, so we'll have to wait and see what comes of it.</p>

I've taken trips with and without my DSLR camera, some with just a tablet, some with a VR headset alongside a mouse and keyboard, and others with just a phone in my pocket. Each of these setups is good for different types of trips, but what about the times you need a little bit of everything?</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-use-nearby-share-your-android-phone">Android Quick Share</a> finally made file transfer a breeze, enabling extremely fast, one-tap transfer between Android devices, Windows devices, or both. I regularly pass files between my Windows-based laptop and any number of Android phones in my possession, and it's made my life and job so much easier.</p><p>But what about sharing screens or even transferring mouse and keyboard input between devices? That's a lot harder, but some companies have created ecosystems that work well with each other in a nearly seamless way. People have stuck with Apple for this reason, and now a few Android companies have finally caught up, offering easy cross-device connectivity between phones, laptops, and tablets, all without having to download extra apps or paid services to get the job done.</p><p>I'm going to highlight what I think are the three best interconnectivity solutions available on Android today, all of which work a little differently and have a slightly different scope.</p>
<h2 id="hello-moto-2">Hello Moto</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93" name="Smart-Connect-new-dashboard" alt="Smart Connect new update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xc68iwyFXVZW5R58FmJt93.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of all the available solutions, Motorola takes the cake for device simplicity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Motorola Smart Connect</a> just requires you to have a Motorola phone or tablet, and the rest falls right in line. It requires the most setup of the three ecosystems I talk about today, but that's because you can use any Windows-based laptop to connect your phone or tablet as if they were one big, cohesive device.</p><p>Once you've got the Motorola Smart Connect software installed on your computer, pairing it with your Motorola smartphone or Lenovo tablet is just a QR code scan away. From there, all linked devices will share a clipboard and have easy file transfer. You can even pull up your phone or tablet's storage on your PC as if it were a USB drive.</p><p>What's particularly cool is that you can run individual phone apps on your PC, letting you multitask your favorite idle clicker game alongside those work spreadsheets, all without having to touch the phone. Motorola lets you control your phone or tablet with the same mouse and keyboard as your PC. So they feel like an extra monitor instead of separate devices running different operating systems. Plus, you can use your phone's camera as a webcam for any meeting, which could come in handy in several scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="uncle-sam-sung-2">Uncle Sam(sung)</h2>

<p>Samsung makes a lot of electronics. From washing machines to TVs and refrigerators to smartphones and tablets, the company does an impeccable job of cohesively connecting all these devices. Samsung smart home devices work with non-Samsung phones and computers via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/samsung-smartthings-home-insight-edge-ai-detailed" target="_blank">SmartThings</a> app, but for the scope of this article, interconnectivity between your phone, tablet, and laptop all have to be between Samsung Galaxy products.</p><p>It's easy to share your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>'s screen with a Samsung TV by tapping "share screen" in the notification shade. Moving windows and apps between a Samsung tablet and phone just requires you to enable multi-control. And if you're lucky enough to have a Samsung Galaxybook laptop, you can even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-multi-control-with-samsung-galaxy-devices">share your Samsung GalaxyBook's keyboard with your phone</a>.</p><p>You can also transfer files between devices by using familiar interfaces — either the share dialog on an Android device or File Explorer on Windows — as well as share clipboards between devices. There are few things handier than copying a link on your phone and being able to instantly paste it somewhere on your PC.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a> has been around for the better part of a decade and provides an easy way to use your phone like a laptop, letting you hook it up via USB-C cable to any monitor to project UI that looks and works exactly like a PC. Samsung hasn't done much with DeX in a while but it still works well for those times when you need better multitasking and don't have a laptop around to do it.</p>
<h2 id="it-s-been-an-honor-2">It's been an Honor</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="upBPyueXd57EZQeeeXRx6C" name="Honor-Magic-Ring-01" alt="Connecting an Honor Pad V9 to the Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon laptop via Honor Magic Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/upBPyueXd57EZQeeeXRx6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while I really like all the interconnectivity from Samsung, there's still a bit of setup that's required to get everything working together. Honor's Magic Ring, the company's oddly named interconnectivity solution, automatically recognizes and enables connectivity between any Honor device around it that's signed into the same Honor account.</p><p>Magic Ring is a centralized connectivity suite that shows all adjacent devices with all potential actions available for each. The same UI is found on every device with Magic Ring support — Honor tablets, phones, and laptops — so there's no misunderstanding about what devices support which functions.</p><p>If I tap the laptop icon, I can tap either screen sharing or input sharing, then tap the accompanying device to perform that action. In the case of my most recent work trip, tapping screen share and then tapping the tablet icon gave me an instant second monitor I could use while working from my hotel room.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eyzZXofq6RgqZvQMDjrh3C" name="Honor-Magic-Ring-03" alt="Connecting an Honor Pad V9 to the Honor MagicBook Art 14 Snapdragon laptop via Honor Magic Ring" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eyzZXofq6RgqZvQMDjrh3C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Likewise, tapping the icon for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro </a>smartphone or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/honor-pad-v9-review">Honor Pad V9</a> tablet gives me additional options like taking a picture and instantly sharing the photo to my laptop.</p><p>Magic Ring was also <em>vital</em> to my job during Hurricane Helene last Fall when I had no home internet for a month. I didn't want to pay T-Mobile for an unlimited hotspot package, and Magic Ring let me run my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a> foldable in split-screen on my tablet so I could quickly transfer files and browse the web from the larger screen.</p><p>Aside from great interconnectivity, Honor's devices are also a lot better for me to use because of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM sensitivity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="staying-connected-is-vital-2">Staying connected is vital</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-9" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra using Samsung DeX with multiple windows open" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hv8NUhNFFZwdogshxor4cR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Interconnectivity between devices is more than a gimmick or convenience. It's a huge part of what makes device ecosystems better than others and why people often choose to use Samsung or Honor devices over some other Android manufacturers.</p><p>These companies aren't alone in offering interconnectivity — OnePlus, for instance, offers auto-connect capabilities between devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> — but Honor and Samsung offer more devices than most other Android manufacturers, making their interconnectivity solutions a bit more valuable.</p><p>The recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a> aims to go beyond current offerings by extending interconnectivity to all devices — not just ones made by Honor — including iPhones and other non-Android devices by utilizing the power of AI.</p><p>It remains to be seen just how well this works, but it's exciting to see interconnectivity continuing to be pushed. Who knows, Honor's model may eventually become ubiquitous in smart device connectivity the way <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/matter">Matter</a> is with smart home connectivity.</p>

<ul><li>The alleged Pixel 9a was shown off from all angles in a YouTube Shorts video.</li><li>Leaker took it to the Lucha Libre match and filmed the event with the mid-range device.</li><li>The video confirms what the leaks so far have hinted, that Google has changed up the camera bar on the Pixel 9a.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Pixel 9a leaks keep on giving. This time, the phone was not just spotted but also seen in action. A leaker took the alleged Pixel 9a to the Lucha Libre match — a wrestling match in Mexico City — where they were seen filming the event with the device (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/pixel-9a-leak-shows-off-camera/">as first spotted by 9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qlJdTW62nOc">video</a> of the leak was posted on YouTube Shorts, and the tipster seems to be holding the alleged device in a black colorway. They first show off all the angles of the phone and then proceed to film the match with it as well.</p><p>First, the Pixel 9a seems to be held against a bag of snacks, showcasing the size of the device, which we expect to be 154mm tall and 73mm wide. After that, the leaker flips around the phone, showing us the rounded corners and the almost flat rear panel with the signature "G" logo and the camera array.</p><p>As previous leaks have indicated, the phone may see an overall flatter look with its rear panel, ditching its usual camera bump for a pill-shaped horizontal camera casing that sort of integrates the lens into the back panel of the device.</p><p>Furthermore, the phone is speculated to have two cameras on the back: a 48 MP primary lens and a 13MP ultrawide one. Which is what the leaker seems to be filming the Lucha Libre match with.</p>

<p>The supposed Pixel 9a was only showcased in the first few seconds of the video; after that, the leaker proceeded to film the match. The publication further notes that the leaker claimed to be filming with the device, showcasing the phone's zoom capabilities, as seen in the video above.</p><p>It remains unclear if all the shots were taken by the alleged Pixel 9a that was showcased at the start, however. While most of the details check out with previous leaks, it remains to be seen how the actual device will turn out.</p><p>Rumors suggest that Google's new mid-ranger will launch sometime in March, but it could also appear at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">Google I/O in May this year</a>. While we wait for the ball to drop, here's what we <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a#section-google-pixel-9a-cameras">expect to see </a>from the Pixel 9a this year.</p>

<ul><li>Disney Plus is trying to build interest for Andor Season 2, but it's doing so on YouTube in a way that's not just an ad run.</li><li>The first three episodes of Andor Season 1 are available on YouTube for viewers to watch, alongside a Season 1 recap.</li><li>Andor Season 2 will premier on Disney Plus on April 22.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Disney makes an interesting move to get more people excited about the second season of Andor.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/tv/626966/andors-first-three-episodes-are-streaming-on-youtube">The Verge</a>, Disney Plus' original Star Wars show, Andor, has headed for YouTube to promote its upcoming second season. Instead of running what you'd expect: ads, the company is looking to grab the viewer's attention by dropping some of the first season on the platform — for free.</p><p>Disney started posting the videos on YouTube yesterday (Mar 10). All of the content is there, with the episodes running 39 mins, 35 mins, and 40 mins, respectively, for the first three. The streaming service has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL148kCvXk8pARjuC9IHQUH3YpHeW8UzP_">created a neat playlist</a> for users who'd like to binge these episodes for a little while.</p><p>What's more, if Disney has captivated you enough to head over to its platform and watch the rest (or Hulu as the post notes), there is a Season 1 recap video available. This video runs for roughly 15 minutes and hits you with everything you should keep in mind before the next run begins.</p><p>The publication highlights Andor's creator, Tony Gilroy, is preparing to host an hour-long "rewatch event" on YouTube on March 13.</p><p>Andor Season 2 will begin on April 22 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney Plus</a>.</p>

<p>There's no getting around the fact that Disney Plus started enforcing its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-paid-sharing-enforced-us-launch">paid sharing program</a> in the U.S. last September. Similar to what we've seen others do (Netflix), Disney Plus is letting subscribers add an "extra member" to their <em>household </em>account. Those with the Basic Plan can do so for an extra $6.99. Others who've purchased the Premium variant will see an additional $9.99 charge.</p><p>These were all things <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-explores-password-sharing-crackdown">talked about prior</a>, but Disney's CEO Bob Iger <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/disney-plus-password-sharing-crackdown-begins-june-2024">confirmed</a> its arrival last spring. To quote Iger, he stated a couple of years back that he wanted "Disney Plus to become a growth business for Disney and that effort appears to be starting with new password-sharing initiatives."</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.disneyplus.com/news/next-on-disney-plus-march-2025">March is packed</a> with new things coming to Disney Plus, like the resurgence of a popular Marvel character through Daredevil: Born Again. The show kicked off on March 4 with a two-episode season premier and continues today (Mar 11) with episode three. Moana 2 is set for its streaming debut on March 12 alongside even more content for Hulu and ESPN Plus subscribers.</p>

<ul><li>Google is rolling out several Gemini-backed features for its Workspace Business and Enterprise edition (Standard and Plus) users.</li><li>Meet grabs a new "Studio" feature dubbed "Studio Look" for camera clarity while Google Chat brings its in-app translation ability to more users.</li><li>The company recently brought a Gemini-powered side panel addition to Gmail, which lets users quickly add events to calendar from emails.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google continues to spread Gemini's influence across its Workspace suite of apps, and its latest update brings it to its communication sector.</p><p>The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/more-ai-powered-features-for-google-workspace-business-and-enterprise-editions.html">posted</a> another set of patch notes for how Gemini will enhance the Workspace experience for Business and Enterprise editions (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/11/gemini-google-meet-chat-workspace/">9to5Google</a>). The update rolling out today (Mar. 11) concerns users with those editions who frequently use apps like Meet and Chat. The former is on the receiving end of the most Gemini enhancements this week as Google states Meet will pick up a new "Studio" feature addition.</p><p>Joining Google Meet will be Gemini's ability to "detect and enhance" the look of your portrait during a meeting via "Studio Look." The changelog states the AI leverages its machine-learning capabilities to get this done. In short, this means the AI will try to clarify your image and sharpen your appearance if things are fuzzy/blurry.</p><p>Google then reiterates a couple of Meet's existing features it discussed earlier this year, like "Studio Sound" and "Studio Lighting." The former enables the AI to "recreate and balance" your sound. Essentially, Google says this is Gemini working to fill in the gaps of your voice coming through your microphone if the frequency becomes distorted.</p><p>"Studio Lighting," on the other hand, leverages its machine learning to "simulate" a studio's lighting. There are a few device requirements to get this working, to which Google encourages users to check its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/meet/answer/14441737">full support document</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZoWNjLezhNGXMXWEqfkeCi" name="Google-Chat-hero" alt="Google Chat logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZoWNjLezhNGXMXWEqfkeCi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google brings awareness to another Meet feature called "generate background images." The company is essentially reiterating its existence as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/updates-for-generating-meeting-backgrounds-with-gemini.html">this already started rolling out</a> last week for Meet. Gemini gives users the following options: Professional office, bookshelf, stylish living room, cozy living room, tropical beach, fantasy castle, sci-fi spaceship.</p><p>Google Chat is picking up a Gemini update for Business and Enterprise editions called "translate for me." The company says the AI in Chat will automatically detect over 120 languages and translate them for users in their preferred choice. The update continues with a Gemini's addition in Google Drawing with "background image removal."</p><p>Both features for Chat and Drawing are available for users.</p><p>Regarding Meet, Google states the custom backgrounds, studio sound, and lighting will begin today (Mar. 11). However, Studio Look in Meet will begin next week on March 18. It's worth reiterating that these features are for Google's Workspace Business and Enterprise editions (Standard and Plus).</p><p>Google dropped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-calendar-gemini-ai-add-option-gmail-rollout">a Gemini update</a> for Gmail yesterday, which brought better integration between it and Calendar. Soon, users will notice an "add to calendar" button if Gemini detects important dates within an email. Clicking on it will have Gemini automatically create an event for that date (alongside its time) in your calendar. This seems to have been the culmination of what Google started last year via its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">Gemini 1.5 Pro Labs test</a> for users, which was the start of its AI-powered side panel feature in Workspace.</p>

<ul><li>Two Galaxy S25 Edge models show up in a UL Demko certification database.</li><li>The listing shows that both devices are carrying batteries with a rated capacity of 3,786mAh.</li><li>Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S25 Edge in mid-April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge sightings have increased lately, pointing to an impending launch somewhere closer to the second week of April — which isn't that far away.</p><p>A new leak reveals two models of the Galaxy S25 Edge that were listed on UL Demko and India's BIS Databases. These listings provide us not just alleged model numbers of the phone but also battery specifications — which have been rumored to be pretty small from the start.</p><p>Now, these listings so much as confirm the above. First spotted by The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thetechoutlook.com/tech-whispers/samsungs-galaxy-s25-edge-battery-spotted-on-ul-demko-and-bis-databases-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-batteries-also-listed-on-the-bis-database/">TechOutlook</a>, the Galaxy S25 Edge is said to launch with a rated battery capacity of 3,786mAh, which may translate to the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-leaked-specs" target="_blank">3900mAh </a>capacity that previous leaks entailed.</p><p>The certifications showed up with model numbers <strong>EB-BS937ABY </strong>and <strong>EB-BS937ABE</strong><em> </em>on the UL Demko database, certified with certificate numbers <strong>DK-162562-UL</strong><em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>DK-162516-UL</strong>,<em> </em>as seen below.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2NypzXr53wD3a2DpuXcK3" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-Battery-Spotted-on-UL-Demco" alt="Listing showcasing battery specs of Galaxy S25 Edge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2NypzXr53wD3a2DpuXcK3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: The Tech Outlook)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This only indicates that you'd have to be plugged into a charger now and then if you choose to get the Galaxy S25 Edge. For comparison, the base Galaxy S25 model has 4000mAh battery capacity, and with Samsung trying to fit all of its latest AI features into the phone, the device could be heavily reliant on its core processing chip. It is rumored to come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, like the rest of the Galaxy S25 series, and a pretty hefty 200MP primary camera.</p><p>The only reason behind this could be the fact that the Korean OEM could be chasing the slimness of the phone over the battery capacity and its inability to fit in a more powerful one. The device is tipped to weigh around 162g and measure 5.75mm thin, much like Techno's ultra-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Spark Slim</a>, which managed to fit in a massive 5200mAh battery — making it possible to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>In other news, Samsung's next set of foldables could be launching closer to its summer Unpacked and the publication seems to have spotted model numbers of the  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7 </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> as well. The latter's models were seen as <strong>EB-BF766ABE</strong>, <strong>EB-BF766ABY</strong>,<strong> EB-BF767ABE</strong>, and <strong>EB-BF767ABY</strong>, while the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will come with <strong>EB-BF966ABE</strong>,<em> </em>EB-BF966ABY,<em> </em>EB-BF967ABE,<em> </em>and<em> </em><strong>EB-BF967ABY</strong>.<em> </em>However, the certification didn't seem to divulge any information about the duo's specs.</p>

The show was jam-packed with action, and the big debut of Flat2VR Studios' huge library of upcoming games, but one theme shone through the big showcase: co-op games.</p><p>While some of the best Meta Quest games are single-player — Batman Arkham Shadow, Behemoth, and Metro Awakening are just a few from the past few months — my favorite VR games almost always involve playing with a friend.</p><p>Seven of the 22 announcements today focus on co-op gameplay, giving friends the opportunity to hang out and take challenges head-on while working together. Social experiences are the best part of VR, and that's what makes these upcoming Meta Quest games so dang exciting!</p>

<p>Population: One used to stand alone as the Meta Quest's only large-scale multiplayer shooter, but the field has widened in the past two years. Contractors Showdown and Ghosts of Tabor proved that the Quest was capable of big multiplayer experiences, and Forefront is here to bring a bit of Battlefield into VR.</p><p>Forefront is the latest title from Triangle Factory, the makers of Breachers and Hyper Dash, and it promises to deliver excellent squad-based combat with vehicles and semi-destructible environments.</p><p>Given how polished Breachers was at release and how effectively it translated some of the best Rainbow Six Siege mechanics to VR, I've got high hopes that this latest release will bring the heat to the Meta Quest when it debuts in early access sometime this summer.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://forefrontvr.com/discord"><strong>Discord</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/forefront/28816918137899319"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2981220/Forefront"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>

<p>I've put a lot of hours into Dungeons of Eternity since its debut in mid-2023, and Reave looks to take the successful formula and combine it with the PvPvE concept of Ghosts of Tabor. Players will enter public dungeons as a party tasked with plundering treasure and clearing out the monsters along the way, but be aware that this dungeon is accessible by *anybody* playing the game.</p><p>That means there's a very real chance another party could ruin your day just as you round the final corner or collect a huge treasure, or a benevolent benefactor could very well bless you with riches untold. Humans are funny creatures, but can you trust them more than the nearest goblin or living skeleton? We'll have to find out sometime this year, but you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://discord.gg/mZ3xSN4s9a"><strong>jump into the Discord now</strong></a> and get ready for the early access debut.</p>
<h2 id="zix-2">Zix</h2>

<p>Zix promises to be a co-op roguelike as you've never played before. From the surreal visuals to the "ever-morphing worlds," players should expect unique gameplay they can experience in awe with friends. In the game, you're tasked with being an Acolyte of Chaos, roaming three different worlds in search of chaotic energy that you can combine to create entirely new realms, mix and match enemies, and just get crazy with the reality around you.</p><p>Zix boasts what it calls a proprietary gesture-based combat and movement system that foregoes menus and button mashing with physical movement. Developer Hidden IO says you'll be "dashing, dodging, launching projectiles, and stringing together attacks" using nothing but the triggers, grips, and your imagination. Just as you think you've mastered the controls, you'll come face to face with massive bosses and challenges you didn't expect.</p><p><strong>Check it out on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/zix/8582035711867299/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/635700/ZIX/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> and wishlist it for its Fall release!</strong></p>
<h2 id="exoshock-2">Exoshock</h2>

<p>Exoshock will be at GDC in just a week with full hands-on opportunities, but until then, we're getting a full taste of what to expect from this 1-4 player co-op PvE game inspired by Helldivers 2, Warhammer 40K, Halo, and FEAR. The game utilizes a vibrant sci-fi art style with procedurally generated environments, giving players a fresh experience every time they venture out with their squad.</p><p>Developer Polarity One says the environments are "hostile, oppressive, and alive" as the ships you board teeter on the brink of destruction from the monstrous invaders. Exoshock promises to be "more than just another shooter" as it aims to push the boundaries of existing cooperative VR concepts. You'll pick one of three roles with a dedicated focus, including Flanker, Suppressor, and Technician, each toting weapons the developer says feel visceral and powerful. We're expecting this one later this year.</p>
<h2 id="roboquest-vr-2">Roboquest VR</h2>

<p>The original Roboquest release was an extremely popular roguelike on Steam, garnering over 16,000 "overwhelmingly positive" reviews on Steam since its August 2020 release. Now, Flat2VR Studios is bringing the insanely fast-paced action to the Meta Quest this Fall, challenging players to hone their reaction times as they venture out alone or with a friend.</p><p>If you've played the original, you'll immediately be familiar with the vibrant, detailed visuals, liquid-smooth gameplay, and overwhelming hordes of enemies that pummel you throughout every level. Randomly generated environments keep things fresh every run, and the upgrades you find along the way will prepare you for the massive bosses that dot the landscape to provide fresh challenges.</p><p>Grab a big ol' Gatling gun and a friend for Roboquest VR's release this Fall and <strong>wishlist it </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3151760/Roboquest_VR/"><strong>on Steam</strong></a><strong> now</strong>. We expect a Meta Quest store listing to go live before the release.</p>

<p>The Windlands series was renowned for its free-flying, grappling hook-based platforming gameplay, and now those developers are taking their expertise of unique VR locomotion to a new co-op adventure.</p><p>Players will shoot, slingshot, glide, and guard against enemies as they make their way through exciting levels with friends, culminating in titan-sized boss battles to conquer at the end. It sounds incredibly exciting, and the studio's pedigree gets us even more pumped for its release sometime this year.</p>

<p>Breachers has been one of my all-time favorite multiplayer VR games since its release in Spring 2023, and the game's 2-year anniversary comes along with a brand-new gadget that's sure to trip even seasoned veterans up: the clone projector gadget. This new gadget projects an image of yourself anywhere you place it, acting as the perfect way to fool your enemies while you lie in wait in the shadows.</p><p>I play Breachers weekly with a group of friends, and the squad-based action never seems to get old. Triangle Factory delivered a seriously solid experience in April 2023 and has been building it up since then, delivering free new maps at regular intervals as well as season passes and skins for folks who love that sort of thing.</p><p>The new gadget is available now, so what are you waiting for? <strong>Pick up a copy of Breachers on </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/breachers/5740397619319389/"><strong>Meta Quest</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/breachers/"><strong>PSVR 2</strong></a><strong>, or </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1922010/Breachers/"><strong>Steam</strong></a><strong> today!</strong></p>
