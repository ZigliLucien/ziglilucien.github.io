<p>Samsung has been working with marine researchers across three regions, helping them restore and study coral reefs for the past year, as a part of its initiative "Coral in Focus." It partnered with Seatrees, a nonprofit organization that has been working on identifying new ways to restore coral ecosystems.</p><p>In a detailed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/coral-in-focus-samsung-marks-one-year-of-marine-ecosystem-restoration-with-galaxy-technology">post</a>, the company revealed that scientists have been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/galaxy-s24-ultra-one-month-later">Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>'s "Ocean Mode" instead of bulky underwater camera equipment to capture vivid pictures of coral reefs in Fiji, Indonesia, and the United States.</p><p>This camera feature, exclusively developed for the coral reef project, significantly reduces blue tones in pictures, which are prominent in underwater photography. Additionally, this feature also minimizes the blurring of images during movement, "optimized by shutter speed and multi-frame image processing." Potentially reducing the challenges that people face when capturing images underwater.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.10%;"><img id="TMA9a2CkaMb8arQicPTdgD" name="Samsung-Coral-in-Focus" alt="Ocean Mode on Samsung S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TMA9a2CkaMb8arQicPTdgD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="491" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Ocean Mode also helps with capturing multiple shots at a pre-set time interval, instead of having the user manually press the shutter button each time they want to click an image, which could turn out to be very tedious when underwater.</p><p>This mode allows the user to pre-set the time, the number of images that need to be captured, and all they have to do is click on the shutter button once. The phone will then click a series of images that are essential for researchers when creating accurate 3D models of these reefs.</p><p>It's important to note that this feature isn't available on the standard Galaxy S24 Ultra devices on the market.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:32.90%;"><img id="h4ZLJJavddAys6wQG2vegD" name="Samsung-Coral-in-Focus" alt="Ocean Mode on Samsung S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/h4ZLJJavddAys6wQG2vegD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="329" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This has helped marine researchers produce "seventeen 3D models of coral reefs to analyze the health and growth of reefs." And a total of 11,046 coral fragments were planted to restore 10,705 square meters of coral reef habitat, which is roughly the size of 25 basketball courts, Samsung added.</p><p>This automated photography approach not only saves time but also ensures that each shot delivers accurate images of these coral reefs, contributing to effective analysis of these tiny aquatic animals.</p><p>This project is a part of Samsung's broader "Galaxy for the Planet" initiative that was started in 2021. Samsung has also been recycling discarded fishing nets and incorporating the material into its smartphones since the Galaxy S22 series.</p>

In many cases, savvy shoppers can buy new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> phones at prices lower than what Samsung is offering with its refurbished devices.</p><p>We've done the hard work for you, finding the best deals that put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung's Certified Re-newed offers</a> to shame.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-the-perks-of-going-with-a-samsung-refurbished-unit-2">What are the perks of going with a Samsung refurbished unit?</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yFmLhsbp8G89X6TVQ6Twh5" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S24-plus-ultra-family-purple-01.jpg" alt="The Galaxy S24 family including the smaller Galaxy S24, larger Galaxy S24 Plus, and premium Galaxy S24 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yFmLhsbp8G89X6TVQ6Twh5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are certainly advantages to buying a Galaxy phone through the Certified Re-newed program. For starters, all refurbished Galaxy devices sold by Samsung get a brand-new OEM battery, which is more than most third-party refurbishers offer.</p><p>You also get "the same one-year limited warranty offered on new smartphones," according to the company. While some other renewed devices might claim to offer warranties for their products, only ones sold by reputable brands — like Samsung and Best Buy — can truly be trusted. Even Amazon's Renewed program merely offers a 90-day blanket return policy, but nothing thereafter.</p><p>For added protection, you can purchase the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Samsung Care Plus</a> plan with the optional Theft & Loss add-on, which is available for new Galaxy devices but not third-party refurbished ones.</p><p>Is that enough to sway you toward a refurbished Galaxy S24 from Samsung. Maybe, but the prices will probably leave a sour taste in your mouth:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24, Black, 128GB:</strong> $620 ($799 MRSP)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, Black, 256GB:</strong> $800 ($999 MSRP)</li><li><strong>Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus, Black, 256GB:</strong> $1,020 ($1,299 MSRP)</li></ul>
<p>Those prices would be passable if the Samsung Galaxy S24 lineup was still new, but it isn't. The Galaxy S25 series is here, and it has taken over. So, if you buy a phone through Samsung's Certified Re-newed program, you're getting a year-old phone and one that's been refurbished for only a slight discount.</p>
<h2 id="oh-and-you-can-buy-new-galaxy-s24-phones-for-cheaper-2">Oh, and you can buy new Galaxy S24 phones for cheaper</h2>
<p>The egregious part of Samsung's refurbished pricing model is that you can purchase brand-new Galaxy S24 units for cheaper than the Certified Re-newed units.</p><p>If you do want a refurbished device, you can save even more by going with a third-party program like Amazon Renewed or Best Buy Geek Squad Refurbished. We've already pointed out the potential downsides of going with a third-party refurbisher, but both Amazon and Best Buy offer free returns. If anything is awry, you can always play it safe and return the refurbished device for a full refund.</p><p>But again, the key thing to remember is that you don't have to go with a refurbished device to save. We found a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Smartphone-Unlocked-Android-Cameras/dp/B0D51S487S/" target="_blank">brand-new Galaxy S24 Ultra on Amazon for just $880</a> and it's unlocked. That's $140 less than Samsung's Certified Re-newed Galaxy S24 Ultra and about $420 less than the device at MSRP.</p>

<p>There are plenty of reasons you might want to be part of the Samsung Certified Re-newed program — the biggest of them being that you help save the planet by reducing e-waste. However, Samsung made buying refurbished a tough decision by setting Galaxy S24 prices way too high. For reference, they're higher than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-certified-re-newed">the Galaxy S23 refurbished prices announced</a> on the same date last year by between $30 and $100.</p><p>So, if you're intrigued by the refurbished Galaxy S24 models, consider grabbing a new model from a third-party retailer instead. Or, if you're dead-set on getting a new battery, one-year limited warranty, and Samsung Care Plus overage, perhaps the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a> is a better value for only a few hundred dollars more.</p>

<p>It's no secret that Spotify is one of the most popular music streaming platforms. Here at our Android Central, our team members largely favor Spotify over YouTube Music for the most part, myself included. The main draw is, of course, the spectacular Jam feature, which is enough to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">woo YouTube Music loyalists</a> such as our managing editor Derrek Lee even.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-jam-sessions-announcement">Launched in September 2023</a>, Jam continues to be Spotify's unique selling point, despite the addition of several new features and tools to the platform since. As it stands, I don't want Spotify to release new options like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify-likely-to-introduce-music-pro-add-on-tier-in-2025">premium tiers</a>. Instead, I wish Spotify would augment Jam sessions with features like comments and reactions. Here's why.</p>
<h2 id="the-social-element-sets-spotify-jam-apart-2">The social element sets Spotify Jam apart</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX" name="tribit-stormbox-flow-12.jpg" alt="Tribit StormBox Flow with phone next to it running Spotify" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XtVSA4tmHrw35aUrusHhCX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What I love about Spotify Jam is the social element it adds to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming</a> experience. An individual starts a Jam session and shares it with friends, who can all create a playlist and listen together.</p><p>This is useful in gatherings like parties and hangouts, but also if you're in a long-distance relationship or just looking to chill with those dear to you remotely. There are even more fun interpretations of this feature that you may not have considered.</p><p>For instance, I went on a short island getaway with my partner and close friends a few months back. We took an eight-hour bus ride to the jetty point together. Now normally, if it was private transport we'd blast music all along the way with everyone contributing to the Jam.</p><p>To avoid disturbing other passengers, we all put on headphones or earbuds and had a private Jam session going, like a silent rave that didn't bother anyone around us. Everyone was queuing songs, making requests or discussing each other's song choices on the group chat.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>What I love about Spotify Jam is the social element it adds to the music streaming experience.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Another friend of mine uses Spotify Jam to spend quality time with his girlfriend while she's on vacation with her family, thousands of kilometers away from him. Time zones might separate them, but something as simple as a Jam helps them feel close to each other and share special moments.</p><p>Even in the midst of work, studies, or workouts at the gym, they communicate by starting a Jam together and simply adding songs they would like the other to try out, or maybe to convey a feeling or thought.</p>
<h2 id="spotify-should-add-social-features-like-notes-comments-and-reactions-to-jam-sessions-2">Spotify should add social features like notes, comments, and reactions to Jam sessions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm sure there are many others out there who use Spotify Jam for its social aspect, to connect with others via music. Spotify should really augment this feature for such users.</p><p>Imagine, being able to add short comments to a Jam session, like users do on timestamps during tracks on SoundCloud. You could highlight your favorite part of a track that your partner shared with you or leave questions for friends in the Jam to answer.</p><p>Think how fun it would be to attach voice notes at the start of a song to explain something, add fun facts, or maybe even dedicate that song to a specific person who is part of the Jam.</p><p>Reactions would also be a welcome addition to Spotify Jam sessions. The fun chaos of having friends with drastically different music tastes means that you can facilitate dialogue, expand your preferences, and simply enjoy learning something new about someone. Naturally, being able to react to songs on a Jam playlist would enhance such experiences, generate friendly banter, and potentially create memorable moments that other music streaming platforms could never.</p><p>By bringing interactive features like these to Jam sessions, Spotify has the potential to become even better than it already is and maybe even redefine what a music streaming app should be capable of.</p>

<ul><li>Strava's new Performance Predictions tab should now be live for paid subscribers on Android and iOS.</li><li>It uses your fitness level, recent number and type of runs, and dozens of other metrics to estimate how quickly you can finish popular race distances.</li><li>You must run at least 20 tracked activities across the past 24 weeks.</li><li>Other fitness brands like Garmin and COROS offer race predictor tools, too.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Strava's push to cater more strongly to runners continued this week with Performance Predictions, a machine learning-based model for predicting your race times based on your "current fitness level."</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-to-acquire-runna-a-leading-running-training-app">acquiring Runna last week</a>, Strava will now help runners "take the guesswork out of race-day planning" by suggesting what pace you can expect to hit in ideal conditions — meaning "a flat course, similar to a track" — for a 5K, 10K, half marathon, or full marathon.</p><p>To see these Strava Performance Predictions, you must have uploaded at least 20 run activities across the last 24 weeks, enough for Strava's ML model to have "sufficient data to make a high-quality and accurate prediction."</p><p>Strava isn't the first brand to offer race predictions based on your stats. Garmin and COROS both have a Race Predictor widget, while Polar calls it a Running Index. In each case, they take stats like your VO2 Max, maximal heart rate, the pace and frequency of your last few weeks of workouts, your current stamina level, and other key stats to suggest your optimal capabilities.</p><p>But Strava says that its methodology — which uses "100 athlete data attributes" — is better than other brands.</p>
<h2 id="how-strava-performance-predictions-work-2">How Strava Performance Predictions work</h2>
<p>"Unlike other race predictors that rely on theoretical inputs like estimated VO2 Max, Strava only uses real activity data to predict race results," Strava's Performance Predictor explainer page claims.</p><p>Strava compares the "performances of athletes with similar training histories" to predict your capabilities; it says this makes your estimates more "realistic" because other comparable athletes achieved these times first.</p><p>Its four race predictions are independent: If your training "emphasizes speed and power," you'll see more 5K and 10K gains, while "running more weekly volume and focusing on longer intervals" will help your marathon times but <em>not</em> your 5K time. I'm looking forward to testing this with some track workouts and long runs in the future.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:39.95%;"><img id="Pw6i2qGX92oogz2bty5uUZ" name="performance-predictions-press-hero" alt="A press screenshot of the new Strava Performance Predictions widget in the Strava app, showing the user's estimated 5K, 10K, half marathon, and marathon times, as well as arrows showing how they've changed since the last estimates." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pw6i2qGX92oogz2bty5uUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="1598" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Strava)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Your predicted times will be found in the You tab of the Strava app, and they'll update to the latest estimate "after each run upload" or after three days without an upload. If you stop uploading enough runs, Strava will cache its last, best race estimates with the old data and wait for you to resume running.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Strava's Athlete Intelligence</a> is best known for analyzing individual workout quality against a 30-day estimate. Performance Predictions is an exciting tool because it uses your data for proactive suggestions of what you are capable of or a race time you should strive to beat.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/strava-interview-athlete-intelligence-inaccurate-gps-race-leaderboards-and-more">interviewed Strava's execs about the future of Athlete Intelligence</a>, CTO Rob Terrell told me that they wanted to make Strava more "forward-looking," rather than fully reactive to how you choose to run. Performance Predictions definitely falls into a new category for the app.</p>
<h2 id="comparing-strava-and-garmin-s-race-predictions-2">Comparing Strava and Garmin's race predictions</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX" name="Strava-Performance-Predictions-vs-Garmin-Race-Predictor" alt="The Strava app showing Performance Prediction times for the author's current condition for 5K, 10K, half marathon, and full marathon races, with a Garmin Fenix 8 draped above the bottom-right of the phone showing a different marathon prediction time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BAMRnLTQkKJsxq6dissQVX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On paper, Garmin's Race Predictor uses similar data to Strava's new service, like "trends in your training load and mileage data," including "special consideration of all different types and frequencies of runs you performed." And every run I've made with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> since 2022 has uploaded to Strava, so they have the same data.</p><p>So it's intriguing that Garmin has a much more <em>optimistic</em> outlook on my running capabilities than Strava.</p><p>The 5K and 10K gap isn't that large; Garmin says I can finish them 62 and 82 seconds faster than Strava's predictions, respectively. But the half-marathon difference is almost five minutes (1:50 vs. 1:45), and Garmin is bullish on me running a sub-4 hour marathon (3:52) while Strava has a more pessimistic guess (4:17).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cHMutNYi2uAvLzfm7ZCZNY" name="Garmin-Race-Predictor-charts" alt="The Garmin Connect Race Predictor widget showing the author's predicted race times over the last year." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cHMutNYi2uAvLzfm7ZCZNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Race Predictor widget in Garmin Connect </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For context, I ran a 1:47 half marathon last month, but my mileage has fallen off in April with a lot of hilly runs. Garmin seems to think I'm capable of a faster PR with the right course and perfect conditioning, while Strava seems to be holding my dip in mileage against me to say I wouldn't do as well today.</p><p>It's hard to say which is right, in other words, but both are reasonable benchmarks.</p><p>As for the marathon predictions, I ran a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/what-i-learned-running-20-mile-race-wearing-four-watches">20-miler last November</a> in 3:10 where I struggled to keep running for the final five miles. I'd like to say I'm in better shape since then, but I'm not any more prepared to run a full 26 miles yet. I'd say Strava's 4:17 estimate is the only realistic one, as I could probably drag my body another six miles at a 13-minute pace. No <em>way</em> I'm hitting 3:52; sorry Garmin!</p><p>In terms of overall presentation, Strava's Performance Predictions page is a little bare-bones; it could probably use an option to see longer-term changes in race estimates, like Garmin offers. And eventually, I'd like to see Strava offer some kind of workout <em>suggestions</em> for how to lower your race times, but since Strava and Runna are staying as separate services (for now), I don't know if Strava has any plans for that.</p><p>If you're a Garmin user and Strava subscriber, go ahead and compare your Strava Performance Predictions against Garmin's guesstimates, and let me know which you think is more accurate!</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-12">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung Wallet is testing out two exciting features: 'Buy Now, Pay Later' and 'Tap to Transfer,' with a potential U.S. launch on the horizon.</li><li>The 'Instant Installment' feature lets you split payments for purchases, while 'Tap to Transfer' works like Apple’s Tap to Cash but with more flexibility for other digital wallets.</li><li>The BNPL feature, powered by Splitit, will let you use Visa or Mastercard without a credit check, though activation may require approval and could have extra fees.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A fresh beta build has given us a sneak peek at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-buy-now-pay-later-early-access-trial-spotted">Samsung Wallet’s "buy now, pay later"</a> and tap-to-send options, and although these are not official yet, all signs point to these features rolling out soon.</p><p>When the Galaxy S25 series made its debut in January, Samsung also snuck in some software updates that flew under the radar. Two standout features were “Instant Installment” for breaking up payments and a peer-to-peer money transfer option that Samsung calls “Tap to Transfer.”</p><p>Samsung’s Tap to Transfer works a lot like Apple’s Tap to Cash—just bump phones to send money. However, while Apple keeps things locked in its ecosystem, Samsung is presumably playing nice with other digital wallets. That means you might not need a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">Galaxy phone</a> to receive cash, giving it a flexibility Apple doesn’t offer.</p>
<h2 id="buy-now-stress-later-2">Buy now, stress later</h2>
<p>Now, leaked screenshots of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/what-is-samsung-digital-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a>, shared by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/theordysm/status/1913895538203705533" target="_blank">@theordysm on X</a>, show a “Buy Now, Pay Later” feature in the works, powered by Splitit (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/samsung-wallet-leak-early-glimpse-two-features/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). It looks like it’ll work with Visa and Mastercard, with no credit check needed. That said, activation still needs approval, and there might be some extra fees in the mix.</p><p>Both features are still in the testing phase, going through internal checks and limited beta runs. Word on the street is Samsung might launch them first in the U.S. once they’re ready for primetime.</p>

<p>From the screenshots, it looks like the Installment Payments feature will let users split their purchases into weekly payments. This option should be available for pretty much any transaction made through Samsung Wallet.</p>
<h2 id="slice-your-bills-2">Slice your bills</h2>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>With over 13 million devices sold, there's no question that Synology is the biggest manufacturer of NAS systems globally. But this category has changed quite significantly in the last 15 months; UGREEN made its grand debut with the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-dxp4800-plus-nas-review">DXP4800 Plus</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/ugreen-nasync-dxp2800-review">DXP2800</a>, delivering sturdy designs with terrific hardware. <br><br>TerraMaster and ASUSTOR also did a much better job last year, polishing their software and overhauling their product lines to deliver better differentiation. By contrast, Synology had a quiet year and a half, with the brand's older models — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds923-plus-long-term-review">DiskStation DS923+</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">DS224+</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds723-review">DS723+</a> — doing most of the heavy lifting. <br><br>Thankfully, that's changing with the debut of the DiskStation DS925+. The successor to the best-selling DS923+ shares the same design, but it comes with dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports as standard, and it has upgraded internals thanks to a quad-core Ryzen V1500B. It has four standard drive bays in addition to dual M.2 slots, and you can use SSDs to store data in addition to caching. <br><br>However, the launch isn't without controversy; with the DiskStation DS925+, Synology is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-brings-severe-hard-drive-limitations-to-diskstation-models-and-im-pissed">limiting its Plus models to its own hard drives</a>, so you can't use Seagate's IronWolf, Exos, or Western Digital's Red Plus HDDs with the NAS. While this restriction came into effect on the brand's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-why-synology-switched-validated-disks-enterprise-nas-enclosures">business models four years ago</a>, it confirmed at the time that consumer models won't be affected — that's clearly not the case now. <br><br>So if you've been using an older NAS model and are considering an upgrade, this is what you need to know about the DiskStation DS925+.</p>

<p>Synology unveiled the DiskStation DS925+ in select Asian markets on April 23, with a global launch slated for May 2025. That's when the NAS will be available in the U.S., U.K., and other western markets. Interestingly, the DS925+ is debuting in countries like India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan ahead of the brand's home market, Taiwan. <br><br>Given that retail availability varies in individual regions, Synology didn't share what the NAS costs in most countries. It will retail for ₹65,205 ($763) in India, which is a smidgen costlier than the ₹62,500 ($731) that the DS923+ costs in the country. The pricing indicates the DS925+ will slot in at roughly the same $599 figure as its predecessor in the U.S., but it isn't unlikely to think it might go up to $649 (or higher) given the tariffs situation.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="pLuJ2555cYDjnzkzbBfdxM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pLuJ2555cYDjnzkzbBfdxM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Synology hasn't changed its design in nearly 10 years, so if you've used any of the brand's NAS servers in the past, you'll feel right at home with the DiskStation DS925+. The NAS has a black aesthetic with good ventilation — both active and passive — and the unassuming design allows it to blend in with ease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="AVnuuixm8rck22jtmAjmeM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AVnuuixm8rck22jtmAjmeM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The sides have a ventilated design that lets air into the chassis, and the NAS has the same dimensions as its predecessor. Build quality is great, and I haven't really seen any issues with any of the brand's NAS servers in the last 10 years. The DS925+ uses an external power brick, and it's able to go up to 120W. It doesn't use anywhere close to that in real use though, and the NAS has two 92mm fans at the back that are quiet even under load.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="vh7C5BgCfTuZScq27o6azM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh7C5BgCfTuZScq27o6azM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I used the NAS in my office, and I didn't have any problems with noise levels even with heavy use. The front has the standard drive bays, and you can easily install 3.5-inch HDDs without any tools; the individual bays can also be locked, and there's a USB-A port on the right. Other than that, you get the usual power button at the bottom, and the LEDs that indicate system, HDD, and LAN status.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="PyVQ9x27XYbRbpErT3hGsM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PyVQ9x27XYbRbpErT3hGsM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The big talking point with the internals is that the DiskStation DS925+ gets dual 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet ports. With every other brand making the switch to 2.5GbE and 10GbE years ago, the DiskStation DS923+ was notable for its use of Gigabit ports, and thankfully, that's not a problem on the DS925+.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5159px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nu38puRJJyG9tGf69WoEpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5159" height="2906" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The NAS is powered by a quad-core Ryzen V1500B platform; it has better headroom overall, and the difference is noticeable even in daily use. The NAS still comes with just 4GB of RAM out of the box, and while that's enough for most tasks, you'll need to slot in another module if you intend to use Docker. Most NAS servers in this segment have at least 8GB of RAM as standard, so it's a little shortsighted that the DS925+ is hobbled in this area.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="imPhnkdEduhqTJ38DRfM6N" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imPhnkdEduhqTJ38DRfM6N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>You still get two M.2 slots on the underside, and they can be used to house M.2 2280 SSDs. The SSDs can be used to store data, and you can easily create storage pools. A notable uptick this time is a USB-C port at the back; this is used to expand drive bays down the line, and works with the new DX525 unit. This is a positive move as the older eSATA connector was clearly showing its age.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1022px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.46%;"><img id="ZjWJHGZEhW7989aLVD36Mj" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ HDD limitation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZjWJHGZEhW7989aLVD36Mj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1022" height="577" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been testing Synology NAS servers for nearly 10 years now, and in that time, I predominantly used Seagate's IronWolf and WD Red drives. When setting up the DS925+, I slotted in two 6TB IronWolf drives as I usually do with all NAS reviews, but it wouldn't even install DiskStation Manager (DSM). I got a dialog box noting the drives were unrecognized, and that I had to do a manual install — which wasn't possible as I was testing the NAS under embargo. <br><br>For reasons I don't follow, Synology chose to enforce the use of its own hard drives in consumer DiskStation models — which is exactly what it said it wouldn't do in 2021. The brand says it conducted "rigorous testing" with its HAT3300, HAT3310, HAT5300, and HAT5310 drives, and using that as the reason to lock down the DS925+ to just these drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="yPdZJyBBCUZykNFKiMK78M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yPdZJyBBCUZykNFKiMK78M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also notes that its drives deliver "higher reliability," but doesn't provide any details as to how they're better than Seagate's Exos drives — my go-to choice right now. Then there's the issue with pricing; in broad strokes, Synology's drives are considerably costlier than their immediate rivals. To give you some context, Seagate's terrific 24TB Exos X24 drive is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Exos-Enterprise-Internal-Drive/dp/B0CM293XCL">down to $479</a> right now, and while Synology doesn't have a 24TB drive, the 20TB HAT5310 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newegg.com/synology-hat5310-20t-20tb-for-nas-systems-7200-rpm/p/N82E16822108845">retails for $719</a>, a premium of 34% while providing less storage. <br><br>Are you getting anything that justifies the added cost? No. Synology's HAT5310 has the same warranty as Seagate's Exos X24, the same 2.5 million hours mean time between failure (MTBF), and identical 550TB/year endurance. There's no meaningful gains to be had, and you're ultimately paying more to get less storage.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5169px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Erk9bQhkhUpT298GBrXN4M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Erk9bQhkhUpT298GBrXN4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5169" height="2912" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Basically, the move is designed to lock users into the brand's ecosystem, and not being able to use IronWolf, Exos, or WD Red drives is a huge limitation. That said, if you're migrating from an older NAS and using the same drives, then there's no issue — I tested this IronWolf drives taken from the DS224+, and it booted without a problem. But if you're setting up a new NAS and want to use Seagate, Western Digital, or any other drives, that's just not possible. <br><br>There is a workaround to add Seagate and WD drives to the verified list, and this is what I've been doing on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/i-set-up-the-ultimate-home-nas-with-over-100tb-of-storage">DiskStation DS1823xs+</a> for nearly a year now. But that isn't possible with the DS925+, as it doesn't even allow you to create a storage pool and install DSM unless you're using a Synology hard drive. This policy is true when it comes to M.2 drives as well, so you can't use any other SSD other than the brand's own limited choices. This move will lose the brand a lot of loyal users, and the worst part is that Synology is just using relabeled Toshiba drives.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="FQECVFQ3ZMNb92huzgmGnM" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FQECVFQ3ZMNb92huzgmGnM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I had to switch to HAT3000 and HAT3310 drives to install the web-based DSM 7.2 interface and test the DS925+. It was straightforward after moving to the brand's drives, and setting up DSM took under 10 minutes. If you're coming from an older model, the interface itself will be familiar; the visuals are identical, and the only difference I noticed is that the DS925+ is better at launching containers. <br><br>A big allure with Synology's NAS systems is the software, and DSM 7.2 continues to lead the way in this regard. The interface is clean, has plenty of customizable utilities, and has an exhaustive list of useful services. I use Synology Photos daily to back up photos and videos automatically from all my phones, and it is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-transfer-google-photos-synology-photos">viable alternative to Google Photos</a>. Synology's software suite has a good design, tight integration with mobile platforms — both iOS and Android — and it covers the essentials.</p>
<p>Whether you need to store photos and videos, share documents, have a local productivity suite, custom mail server, host a website, or use a text editor, DSM 7.2 has you covered. And if there isn't anything available as standard, you can just use Docker to create a container. <br><br>The best use case with the DS925+ is media streaming, and it does a terrific job as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-nas-plex">Plex media server</a>. The Ryzen V1500B platform doesn't have hardware transcoding, and if you don't care about that, there's plenty to like. It handles 4K high bitrate content without breaking a sweat, and I didn't run into any issues whatsoever — it proved to be just as reliable as the DS923+. <br><br>Where the brand has a distinct advantage is with its mobile clients; Synology does a better job than just about every other manufacturer in this area, and it's extremely easy to view and manage the data on your NAS while on the go. This is still the biggest differentiator, and why I continue to use the DS1823xs+ as my main NAS system.</p>

<p>UGREEN's DXP4800 Plus is my go-to choice these days if you need a 4-bay Plex NAS server. The NAS <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/UGREEN-DXP4800-Plus-Attached-Diskless/dp/B0D22JRHZB">retails for $594</a> as of writing, and it has powerful hardware, 8GB of RAM, M.2 slots, and 10GbE in addition to 2.5GbE connectivity. While the hardware is arguably better than the DS925+, the software doesn't quite measure up to DSM, but UGREEN has shown that it is interested in building out the ecosystem. The bonus is that you don't have any restrictions on what drives you can use, or even what software you can install — it's easy to switch to TrueNAS Scale. <br><br>If you need even better hardware, TerraMaster's F4-424 Max gets my vote. The NAS is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TERRAMASTER-F4-424-Max-NAS-Storage/dp/B0DB2MF2F9">costly at $899</a>, but you get a 10-core 12th Gen Intel Core i5 1235U, 8GB of RAM, and dual 10GbE connectivity. There are two M.2 slots as well, and the NAS is a Plex powerhouse like no other. The TOS 6 software is a definite move in the right direction, and while it's lacking some polish, you get most utilities as standard, and TerraMaster is doing a decent enough job with its mobile clients.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gCBPw4HbpRm3zrBddLN66M" name="Synology DiskStation DS925+" alt="Synology DiskStation DS925+ NAS review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gCBPw4HbpRm3zrBddLN66M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a 4-bay NAS with the best software</li><li>You want a high-end Plex server</li><li>You need 2.5 Gigabit Ethernet</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You want to use Seagate or WD Red drives</li><li>You want 10GbE connectivity</li></ul>
<p>I'm conflicted when it comes to the DiskStation DS925+; the NAS finally brings upgrades that have been overdue, but it does so at the cost of other limitations. Having to use Synology's drives is a big pain point, and it doesn't make much sense. There's no end-user benefit to enforcing this rule, and it ultimately curbs what is an otherwise great NAS. It's clear that the brand's hubris got in the way of clear-headed strategy, and it is bound to pay the price as a result. <br><br>At the end of the day, if you're used to Synology and want a familiar interface and don't mind buying the brand's hard drives — they cost more than their rival IronWolf and WD Red options — the DiskStation DS925+ is still a great option. But if you don't want to go down this route (understandably), there are better choices available. <br><br>Synology could have pulled off a move like this two years ago, but the NAS ecosystem has changed drastically in the intervening time, and there's no shortage of standout products in the market now. If you need to upgrade, I'd suggest getting the UGREEN DXP4800 Plus. It has better hardware, and while the software isn't as good as DSM 7.2, you can easily install TrueNAS, and there are absolutely no limitations.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Fi is celebrating 10 years of its inception on Tuesday (Apr 22), and has announced a new affordable plan alongside some enhancements to its existing plans.</p><p>The new plan is dubbed Unlimited Essentials, and as the name implies, it covers the essentials of a carrier plan — like giving users unlimited calls, texts, and data — with 30GB of high-speed data for the U.S. region. The search giant announced through a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/google-fi-wireless/10-years-unlimited-essentials/">blog post</a> that one connection will cost $35 per month.</p><p>While that makes it the entry-level offering of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a>, the other unlimited plans are also getting some love for the existing price. For instance, the Simply Unlimited plan is now dubbed Unlimited Standard and gives users 50GB of data, a significant bump from 35 GB. It also includes 25GB of hotspot tethering, which is up from 5 GB. Additionally, the consumers also get coverage in Canada and Mexico, alongside having full connectivity on select smartwatches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wu9ApEepSBF5fZjs75gpKo" name="Google-Pixel-7-Google-Fi.jpg" alt="Google Fi on a Google Pixel 7 at Google's Fall 2022 event" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wu9ApEepSBF5fZjs75gpKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Similarly, Unlimited Plus is renamed to Unlimited Premium, which comprises 100GB of data, up from 50 GB. Plus, 50GB of high-speed hotspot tethering is also included. Other perks of the plan include six months of YouTube Premium, 100GB of Google One cloud storage, and connectivity for tablets and laptops without any additional cost.</p><p>Google has also announced that it is broadening its access to its data-only SIMs to data-only eSIMs, which means users “can quickly and easily connect newer, eSIM-compatible devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a> and iPads with data on the go, without needing a physical SIM card.”</p><p>Google Fi 5G international coverage is expanding to more than 92 global destinations for users on the Unlimited Premium and Flexible plans. And, the company is doubling the 5G network by adding 54 countries, which makes it available on iPhones, next to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks, iPhone users can listen to voicemails directly on the phone app instead of the Fi app for those on the Google Fi network.</p><p>The 10th anniversary celebrations of Google Fi don’t stop there, as the company is also launching limited-time promotions for new and existing Fi users.</p><p>“For new customers, we're offering the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel Watch 3 on us. You’ll get $300 off the Pixel 9 Pro instantly and the remaining $699 back over 24 monthly bill credits. After the phone ships, we’ll email you a code for Pixel Watch 3 to get $100 off instantly and $349 back over 24 monthly bill credits. This offer is available until April 29, or while supplies last.”</p><p>Existing customers, on the other hand, will get even deeper instant rebate discounts across all Pixel 9 series phones. Users can check their Fi account for these new offers.</p>

<hr>
<p>OpenAI would be willing to buy Google's Chrome browser if a court orders its buyout, said Nick Turley, OpenAI's ChatGPT chief, on Tuesday. Turley was asked to testify by the Department of Justice (DOJ) as part of Google's antitrust trial that is expected to go on for the next three weeks (as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-22/openai-would-buy-google-s-chrome-browser-chatgpt-chief-says?srnd=phx-technology&sref=HrWXCALa">Bloomberg</a>).</p><p>“Yes, we would, as would many other parties,” Turley said when he was asked if the company would be interested in buying Chrome.</p><p>The judge presiding over this case, Amit Mehta, determined last year that Google is violating antitrust laws by monopolizing the search market.</p><p>As a part of the remedy to even out the playing field for other competitors in the market, the DOJ has proposed that Google sell off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, and maybe even Android. The DOJ argues that splitting up these key assets is the only way to fix the problem of Google's monopoly.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that Turley stated that having Chrome more integrated into OpenAI would enhance the product in many ways. “You could offer a really incredible experience," he said. OpenAI could “have the ability to introduce users into what an AI-first experience looks like.”</p><p>Turley even stated that despite being Apple's first choice of AI, OpenAI is facing a lot of difficulties when it comes to getting its foot in the door with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphones</a>, considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> resides in most of these phones.</p><p>Speaking of difficulty, ChatGPT's chief stated that they're worried OpenAI might be shut out by tech giants like Google, which rule the market. "We have powerful competitors who control the access points for how people discover products, including our product.

<p>Earlier today, Google's VP <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-paid-samsung-hefty-amounts-of-money-to-preinstall-gemini">confirmed</a> that the company has been paying Samsung to preinstall Gemini on its devices. This payment contract is set for two years and provides fixed monthly payments that began in January 2024. Defending itself, Google's VP said other companies like Microsoft, Meta, and OpenAI have all approached Samsung with "competitive offers" to make their AI a default on its devices.</p><p>Google said it has amended the above contract with Samsung to allow it to offer other AI apps within its devices if it chooses to do so.</p><p>That said, Google makes the most money YoY only from Search and other advertising (in Q3 2024, it reached $49.39 billion) and it would make things extremely challenging for potential buyers. That said, if Google is pushed by the judge to do so, then it would bring about a significant shift in the way we interact with Google and its products. It remains to be seen how things will play out in the next three weeks.</p>

<ul><li>Instagram launches its own video editing app dubbed "Edits" globally to all Android and iOS users.</li><li>The app has advanced editing tools like clip-level precision, along with creative tools like green screen and AI image animation.</li><li>This app allows creators to see real-time stats, like viewer engagement on Reels, to help them understand if their reel was a hit or a miss.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Instagram has launched its new video editing app today (April 22) to all Android and iOS users globally. The Edits app brings with it a whole host of free editing features, along with creative tools that will help creators make reels and edit on the go, without having to switch between other editing apps and Instagram.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-tries-to-capitalize-on-tiktok-uncertainty-with-new-edits-app">Edits app was teased</a> by Instagram head Adam Mosseri back in January when TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, which also owns a video Editing app called CapCut, were made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tiktok-wechat-be-banned-us-app-stores-sunday-september-20">unavailable</a> in the U.S. for a brief period.</p><p>Meta wanted to capitalize by launching a CapCut-like Edits app to its users, just as it chose to launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-threads-now-live">Threads</a> after Elon Musk took over X (previously Twitter). After a two-month delay from its original February launch target, the Edits app has finally arrived.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:63.00%;"><img id="5fzNn2WEshXavwyd4v3K2X" name="Instagram-Edits" alt="Edits for Insta" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5fzNn2WEshXavwyd4v3K2X.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The app streamlines the editing process for creators by giving them access to tools that can adjust video resolution, frame rate, and dynamic range in a video.</p><p>Much like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/instagram-bringing-recommendations-reset-button">Instagram</a>, the Edits app also has various fonts and dynamic text animations with customizable colors that can be added to videos. Additionally, users can access licensed music, sound effects, voiceovers, and video filters to enhance the overall look and sound of their Reel.</p><p>The app description indicates that users can enhance audio to make voices clearer and remove background noise, as well. Plus, Edits gives creators access to additional tools like touch-up, green screen, and AI image animation to help them bring their ideas to life.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="USCeVpmditWdt6NZ7UixeF" name="Instagram-Edits" alt="Instagram Edits launches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/USCeVpmditWdt6NZ7UixeF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Instagram)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>What sets Edits apart is that it gives creators a live dashboard where they get to see real-time insights on how their videos are performing online, with stats including engagement, clicks, and average view duration. This helps creators gauge whether their idea meshed with followers or if they have to change their strategy for future content.</p><p>The Edits app doesn't leave any watermarks behind when you export or save an edited video through the app, making it easy for users to share videos on competing social media platforms.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://creators.instagram.com/edits?locale=en_US#features">Edits</a> app is free and is available for download via the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.instagram.basel&hl=en_US">Play Store</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/edits-an-instagram-app/id6738967378">App Store</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>This week, Meta launched a new Meta Quest store page revealing the top-50 best-selling games of all time on the platform. I was tipped off to it yesterday when one of my favorite VR games, Walkabout Mini Golf, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Mighty_Coconut/status/1914334146006077844">posted on X</a> about being the 20th best-selling game of all time on the Quest. Funny enough, Walkabout shares one common trait with 80% of all games on the list.</p><p>But it's not the type of game that's the trait, nor is it the price of the games or their complexity. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/1377690143243672/">The official list</a> actually sports a <em>ton</em> of variety, with all but maybe one major genre not represented (strategy games).</p><p>No, instead, I noticed that only 11 out of the top-50 games were part of an already-established franchise: Among Us, Five Nights at Freddy's, Resident Evil, The Room, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, The Walking Dead, and four Star Wars games. And most of these were original spin-offs, with only a few ports.</p><p>Nearly 80% of the best-selling Meta Quest games of all time are from names you've never heard of if you don't have a VR headset. While that could be worrisome for some players, I think it's a very good thing.</p>

<p>Years ago, I wrote about how big publishers ignoring VR <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/vr-doesnt-need-big-publishers-they-ruin-everything-anyway">was a good thing</a>. These companies often don't care about gaming as an art and are only in it to make millions of dollars. Take <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/assassins-creed-nexus-vr-review">Assassin's Creed Nexus</a>, for example, which has made Ubisoft <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ubisoft-sales-expectations-assassins-creed-vr">several million dollars</a> and saw an uptick in sales around the release of Assassin's Creed Shadows. Despite making quite a bit of money for the company, it didn't land on the top-50 list.</p><p>Notably, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metro-awakening-review">Metro Awakening</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">Batman Arkham Shadow</a>, and even the recently-released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/alien-rogue-incursion-meta-quest-3-review">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a> aren't on there, either. In fact, the only games on the list that would fit a more traditional definition of a AAA game are The Walking Dead: Saints & Sinners, Resident Evil 4, and Arizona Sunshine. Compare that with the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/174cdc0a-cdf3-4970-821e-2d33fee97b4e/1">best-selling PlayStation 5 games</a>, which includes franchises and names everyone in the world knows.</p><p>That all plays in quite nicely with the narrative that "there's no money in VR gaming" among big publishers, but the reality is that this couldn't be further from the truth. What appears to be the case is that AAA games don't sell boatloads of copies on the Quest platform, but that doesn't mean they don't make good money.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TTNpVeWmtPsGDwy9h4p2tJ" name="orion-drift-official-screenshot-scrap-run" alt="An official screenshot from Orion Drift on Meta Quest 3, showcasing a Scrapper Run game" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TTNpVeWmtPsGDwy9h4p2tJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Orion Drift </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/section/400089879848137/">top-earning games of the week</a> shows what I'm talking about. The top-3 titles are all free-to-play games, which have driven <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-good-and-bad-of-meta-quest-growth-in-2024">the biggest revenue growth</a> on the platform in recent months, but below that, you'll find many of the AAA games I listed above.</p><p>The Walking Dead, Alien, and Assassin's Creed are all in the weekly top 50, and while these games certainly seem to be doing well for themselves, there aren't many <em>other</em> games of this caliber on the list.</p><p>If anything, this proves the point that VR gamers are putting on headsets to try something new and exciting, not just to rehash the games they've been playing for years (or decades). As VR continues to grow in 2025 and developers find new and unique ways to immerse gamers, it's clear that the most original games that take advantage of the medium's strengths — perhaps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/dimensional-double-shift-hexas-job-simulator-multiplayer">Dimensional Double Shift</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/orion-drift-is-the-new-echo-vr">Orion Drift</a> — are the ones that will end up on the top-50 bestseller list far into the future.</p>

<ul><li>YouTube Music is testing a feature to share song lyrics on social media, similar to Spotify.</li><li>Users can select specific lyrics, choose a color palette, and share them as Instagram Stories or download them as images.</li><li>The feature appears to be a part of the streaming platform's efforts to improve user engagement and compete with other music services.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>YouTube Music is quite popular amongst music streaming services, and it is now gaining yet another popular feature from its rival Spotif,y and is currently being tested on the platform.</p><p>It is the ability to share lyrics to your favorite ones through social channels like Instagram. A Reddit user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/AssembleDebug">AssembleDebug</a>) has recently spotted the feature and it works pretty similar to what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a> has been offering for quite a while now.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Youtube Music is rolling out the lyrics sharing feature which I spotted back in January 👀 https://t.co/9RKwzcKMzX pic.twitter.com/4vMO8o9a95<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1914531019660689690">April 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-review">YouTube Music</a> already offers lyrics for songs that can be accessed from the Now Playing section of the music streaming app. As per the video shared by the Reddit user, once the upcoming feature goes live, users will be able to select specific lines from the lyrics.</p><p>Users can then find a new Next button followed by the new Share button after the preferred lyrics selection, and hitting it would open a share sheet with social icons like Instagram. However, they can be shared as Instagram Stories, per the video, and more social handles are expected to be added once the official rollout of the feature begins.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic/comments/1k4uhbw/looks_like_you_can_now_share_lyrics">Looks like you can now share lyrics!</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/YoutubeMusic">r/YoutubeMusic</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>YouTube Music users are already familiar with sharing their favourite tracks to Instagram, Instagram Stories, and even Snapchat. The new lyrics sharing feature is also identical to the prior and additionally users also get to choose colour palette as well so that selected lyrics appear more fancy in social handles. Alternatively, there is also an option to download as an image.</p><p>It is encouraging to see YouTube Music catching up to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">competition</a> in bringing new features, and it should likely become more engaging. And this should make users who shuffle between apps and have such a feature, could add another reason for such people to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/switching-from-youtube-music-to-spotify">go back to YouTube Music</a> from services like Spotify.</p><p>Early this year, YouTube Music has also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-is-giving-artist-pages-a-slick-new-makeover">started testing</a> giving artist pages a makeover and the popular audio/video switch button <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-testing-shifting-of-audio-video-switcher-button">rearrangement</a> has also seen in the works. All these suggested features could be on the verge of rolling out later this year.</p>

<ul><li>Google has rolled out its Earth Day Doodle for 2025, and it's giving users a glimpse at the many sides of our world.</li><li>Each letter that spells "Google" is given a different environment/ecosystem from somewhere in the world, with info on its rich natural history.</li><li>In 2022, Google gave users a saddening look at how climate change has ravaged our world and changed many of its most beautiful places.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Earth Day has returned once again, and Google is celebrating by rolling out a new doodle in Search to commemorate our big blue ball in space.</p><p>The company announced the appearance of its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://doodles.google/doodle/earth-day-2025/">Earth Day 2025 Doodle</a> in Search in a press release earlier this morning (Apr. 22). Google states its doodle this year features a different snapshot per letter that spells out its name. Each snapshot gives us a clear look at "several breathtaking images from Google Earth from across the globe."</p><p>Each letter has a story, and Google says that all begins with the first letter in its name, "G."</p><p>The first letter is designed in the image of the Maldives. Google states this little features twenty ring-shaped coral formations known as "atolls." Moving on to the first "O," the post states the image seen represents the high-altitude alpine landscape of the Hautes-Alps in the French Alps. The "harsh conditions" of this particular environment features a diverse wildlife that lets adventurous visitors glimpse chamois, marmots, and golden eagles.</p><p>The second "O" is a snapshot of the rugged and tough Côte-Nord from Quebec. This stretch is land is "untamed" as its ecosystem is chock-full of plants and animals tough enough to survive its subarctic air. The second "G" takes us to South America and into Argentina's western Mendoza Province. This semi-arid region contains a collection of rivers that all stem from the country's mountains.</p>
<h2 id="an-ode-to-our-only-home-2">An Ode to our only Home</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.00%;"><img id="34RbHt65rU5UAFX8J8tHVi" name="google-earth-day-doodle-2025" alt="Google's Earth Day Doodle for 2025 is a collection of snapshots from different climates and environments around the world." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/34RbHt65rU5UAFX8J8tHVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="200" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Airbus, Data SIO, NOAA, Landsat / Corpernicus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The "L" in Google brings us into the States — specifically, Utah. Southeast Utah is put on full display in the company's Earth Day Doodle as we see how tectonic movements have impacted this corner of the Colorado Plateau. While there are deep canyons carved by the Colorado River, desert plants around Lake Powell showcase nature's ability to adapt, even in rough arid climates.</p><p>Lastly, the "E" takes us down to Australia to glimpse the remote inland area of western New South Wales. A harsh climate indeed, Google states drought-resistant plants like the spinifex and eucalyptus thrive here. Moreover, wildlife has become accustomed to this rough way of living as they roam gently across the land.</p><p>While Google's 2025 Earth Day Doodle is lighter, showing us the many looks of our wonderful planet, its 2022 version <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-earth-timelapse-doodle-earth-day-2022">was pretty sad</a>. Instead of a standard drawing, 2022's doodle was a GIF that showed how climate change has affected our planet. Each timelapse lasted for multiple hours, and new glimpses were shown throughout the day.</p><p>Users were able to see how destroyed our ice peaks have become, as well as how lush, green forests were destroyed in a matter of years. Even the coral reefs in Australia weren't immune to the human element, as they've suffered rapid bleaching over the years.</p>

<ul><li>A recent rumor claims Samsung is working on adding onto its Galaxy Tab S10 series with a "Tab S10 Lite."</li><li>This "Lite" version could see a more affordable price tag (under the Tab S10 FE) and sport a two-year-old Exynos SoC.</li><li>A tipster states Samsung might also shake-up its Galaxy Tab S11 series by removing its Plus model, instead.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors have reportedly surfaced about the potential future of Samsung's Galaxy Tab series.</p><p>The rumors, which stem from tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-s10-lite-soc-leak-3546807/">Android Authority</a>, claim Samsung is working on adding an extra tablet to its Galaxy Tab S10 series. Supposedly, there's evidence that points toward an upcoming "Galaxy Tab S10 Lite." Of course, with the idea of a "Lite" device, we're immediately thinking of a more affordable device — and the leaks seem to agree.</p><p>The tipster claims that the alleged Tab S10 Lite could feature Samsung's two-year-old <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-exynos-1380-launch">Exynos 1380 5G</a> processor. The chip was originally designed for midrange devices and was paired with the Arm Mali G68 GPU for gaming purposes back in 2023. The chip could also support 144Hz refresh rate displays up to Full HD Plus resolution.</p><p>Additionally, the post highlights leaked code that claims the S10 Lite could feature cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity variants for consumers.</p>

<p>Looking to the future, there's a chance Samsung could shake up the next Galaxy Tab series (in a different way). The publication alleges the Korean OEM could drop the Galaxy Tab S11 Plus from the lineup. If true, that would leave us with a base Tab S11 and Tab S11 Ultra.</p><p>What's more, rumors claim the company could pop MediaTek's flagship <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> into both tablets.</p><p>Little else is known about either of these rumors; specifically, display sizes and other important specs to think about. Regarding the Tab S10 Lite rumor, we have the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-fe-and-s10-fe-plus-launched">Galaxy Tab S10 FE launch</a> to (maybe) give us an idea of what we could see. On the surface, the device wasn't anything to write home about. While the Tab S10 FE Plus offers a larger 13.1-inch display (12% bigger than its predecessor) and loads of AI improvements, the device falls behind in its camerawork.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication assumes the alleged Tab S10 Lite could see a slightly lower price tag than the recent FE models. For context, the Tab S10 FE Plus and base S10 FE launched with a $499 and $649 price tag, respectively.</p><p>When the flagship Galaxy Tab S10 series launched last year, we were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/hey-samsung-wheres-the-galaxy-tab-s10">already short one device</a>: the base model. It made for a slightly confusing release, especially when you consider the series started at $1,000. Users weren't granted a slightly smaller Tab S10 in late 2024, as the entry-level size was 12.4 inches.</p><p>With Samsung supposedly looking to give users a more compact size before ramping things up, we might end up confused all over again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is in the thick of a new federal trial after being accused of breaking <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/us-doj-could-break-up-google-following-ruling">antitrust</a> laws in the tech space by the Justice Department.  Now, new information has come to light. According to the DOJ (Department of Justice) lawyer David Dahlquist, Google has been paying "enormous sums of money" to Samsung every month since January 2024 (as first reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/google-doj-go-back-to-court-to-fight-over-search-monopoly-fix?sref=HrWXCALa">Bloomberg</a>).</p><p>This amount, though not revealed has is being paid to the Korean OEM in installments for preinstalling Google's AI app, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-live-is-available-for-free-on-android-phones">Gemini</a>, onto its devices. The publication further notes  that Google's VP of  platforms and device partnerships, Peter Fitzgerald, confirmed in his testimony that the payment contract is set for two years, with monthly payments going out for each device that preinstalls Gemini</p><p>The contract states that Google will pay Samsung a percentage of the revenue Google earns from advertisements within the Gemini app.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time that Google was found to be paying Samsung to preinstall ap on their devices. The tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2023/11/google-paid-samsung-8-billion-dollars-to-samsung-default-apps.html">paid Samsung $8 billion</a> to default Google Play Store, Assistant, and Search between 2020-2023.</p><p>Bloomberg states that Judge Amit Mehta, who is overseeing this case, found out last year about the practice of paying companies to set their apps as default on Samsung phones—a clear violation of the antitrust laws.</p><p>The DOJ, which built this case against Google, has put forth remedies that will potentially bar Google from paying partners for its search engine to be the default. This could also be stretched to Google’s AI products, including Gemini, which the DOJ has found to also monopolize the market.</p>

<p>In response to these allegations, Fitzgerald stated that other companies like Microsoft, Meta and OpenAI have all approached Samsung with "competitive offers," to make their AI a default on its devices.</p><p>“We took into consideration what was being offered by competitors,” Fitzgerald said. He also stated in court that Google has made amends to the agreement, which will allow Samsung to offer other AI apps within its devices if it chooses to do so. Additionally, Google removed its prerequisite of having Samsung exclusively pre-install  <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-is-getting-a-unified-domain-for-us-and-global-users">Google Search </a>and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/new-google-assistant-now-available-canada-uk-and-more">Assistant</a>.</p>

<p>That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://sammyguru.com/google-is-paying-samsung-a-huge-sum-every-month-to-pre-install-gemini-on-galaxy-devices/">internal documents</a> that were revealed in the trial state that Google could extend the said contract until 2028, making Gemini an exclusive AI platform on future Galaxy devices. This could lead to other AI companies being left behind and Samsung users favoring Gemini over the rest of the apps, considering it comes preinstalled with their phones, creating an anticompetitive environment.</p><p>However, the DOJ also aims to nip this in the bud,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-disagrees-with-u-s-judges-ruling"> has asked Google</a> to separate Chrome from Android, and wants the company to sell Chrome. It also suggested splitting Android from Google Search and Play without forcing a sell-off. If things don't go in Google's favor during the trial, it could potentially change the way users interact with Google's products, as well as how tech companies collaborate.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/fairphone-5-ifixit-perfect-repairability-score">Fairphone</a> has released its 2024 Impact Report which shows the things the company has done to live up to its reputation as an ethical, eco-friendly, and progressive electronics manufacturer.</p><p>The report is full of good news and shows how Fairphone has worked to improve and change how electronics are made. Throughout 2024, the company has reduced its CO2 emissions by 48% (compared to the 2022 report), became 100% e-waste neutral, expanded its list of impact materials, and gave out over $1 million dollars to supply chain workers as part of the company's Living Wage Bonus.</p>
<p>To top it off, it did all these things while experiencing a 3% growth while the overall market is stagnant. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fairphone.com/en/2025/04/17/our-2024-impact-report-is-out-here-are-the-highlights/" target="_blank">read through the report here</a> and learn more about these highlights as well as see everything the company has done to try to change the system.</p><p>I will admit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-wish-the-fairphone-5-was-coming-to-the-us">I love what Fairphone is doing</a> and how they are doing it. It's extremely difficult to design and manufacture tech products that people want to buy, and making sure they will have a long support life and be serviceable makes it even harder.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:970px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.19%;"><img id="2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE" name="fairphone-4.jpg" alt="Fairphone 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2yL9UrsD7riKRTNDkBaMNE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="970" height="545" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/fairphone-fairbuds-user-replaceable-parts-launch">offers earbuds that have replaceable batteries</a> and that's something you simply can't find from anyone else. There are products out there with better specs, but you won't find one that's more friendly to the planet we live on and is built to last the way Fairphone's are.</p>
<p>The problem is that Fairphone can't fix or change anything on its own. Setting a goal like making sure you recycle an equal amount of material for each product you sell and meeting it is awesome, and seeing Fairphone able to do it is amazing. But this is just a drop in the bucket.</p><p>In 2024 Fairphone sold 103,053 smartphones. 103 thousand is a lot of anything, but Apple sells that many on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone launch day</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-shipped-more-phones-than-anyone-else-in-q1-2024">Samsung sells</a> that many over a good weekend. This is where the real change has to happen.</p>
<p>Being realistic, Apple and Samsung could never do the things a small company like Fairphone can. And I know both companies are trying to be producers of ethical and eco-friendly products. The ideas are there, it's the reality of pulling it off that gets in the way.</p><p>Imagine Apple giving out living wage bonuses to cobalt miners or assemblers. Or Samsung selling a million phones and recycling a million others to keep balance. Words like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-becomes-first-tech-giant-be-100-percent-carbon-neutral">carbon neutral</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-new-environmental-strategy">zero emissions</a> are grand, and both companies are working towards those goals, but it's also time to see smaller, yet equally effective changes.</p><p>If Fairphone can build a phone that will last you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/fairphone-3-gets-android-13-update">at least five years</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-true-wireless-headphones">Bluetooth earbuds</a> with replaceable batteries in each <em>and</em> the case, so can Apple or Samsung. Why aren't they?</p><p>You have to love seeing what Fairphone is doing and I think all of us wish them continued success. We also have to ask the tech giants the hard questions about why a tiny company from the Netherlands is doing what they can't.</p>

<hr>
<p>Asus is here for springtime with a couple of new Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus additions that walk the affordable line.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-chromebook-cx14-cx15-stylish-eco-conscious-design-enhanced-performance/">press release</a>, the Taiwanese company announced the new Asus Chromebook Plus CX14 and CX15. The CX15 series is the larger of the duo of laptops coming from the Asus kitchen, as it sports a 15.6-inch FHD display with 300nits of peak brightness and the Intel Core 3 N355​ CPU. Asus states this screen offers a "wide-viewing-angle" with an 87% screen-to-body ratio for a more immersive and full experience.</p><p>The post also highlights the laptop's 180-degree hinge. This will let consumers flip their CX15 laptop into more "versatile" positions alongside the available touchscreen option.</p><p>What's more, Asus draws attention to the wealth of Google AI features present in its CX15 Chromebook Plus model. Not only will users find tools to help with creativity and productivity, but the company highlights 12 months of Google One AI Premium "at no extra cost" when purchasing the device. Users gain Gemini Advanced, 2TB of Cloud storage, and more.</p><p>If you're taking video calls, the CX15 Chromebook Plus delivers AI-powered features to enhance your camera's clarity and reduce your audio's background noise.</p>

<p>Asus is pushing the idea of a tough, affordable Chromebook Plus with the CX15. The model has been met with MIL-STD-810H US military-grade standard certification, meaning it can take some bumps. Moreover, the laptop has been outfitted with a redesigned bottom cover. Now, with four screws implemented, consumers can disassemble the bottom of the laptop to reach its components easily if there's an issue.</p><p>Consumers can quickly hook up a secondary (external) monitor using the laptop's HDMI port.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have the Asus CX14 Chromebook Plus, which mirrors the capabilities of the CX15 version. One of its main differences is that it offers a slightly smaller 14-inch FHD display, but users continue to receive the same built-in Google AI features and more.</p><p>The company offers base CX14 and CX15 Chromebooks with a 14-inch and 15.6-inch FHD display, respectively. It doesn't appear that the base models offer Google's AI built-in, so users will have to look at the Chromebook Plus offerings instead. The same military-grade toughness and removable bottom cover are featured on the base CX14 and CX15 laptops, too.</p><p>Asus states its laptops are available in seven chic colors: Quiet Blue, Fabric Blue, Pure Grey, Misty Grey, Misty Green, Cream Pink, and Rock Grey. However, there are three different finishes users can choose, depending on which model they've purchased.</p><p>The press release did not state the exact pricing of the latest Asus Chromebooks and Chromebook Plus models; however, it highlights their "affordable" tag. More information should become available soon.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2025">Motorola Razr 2025 lineup</a> is expected to be officially revealed this week, on April 24, 2025, according to past teasers. Ahead of that date, the Motorola Razr 2025's promotional materials have leaked courtesy of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1914512702325592316" target="_blank">Evan Blass</a>, revealing every angle of the upcoming flip-style foldable. The Razr 2025, called the Razr 60 in non-U.S. markets, is expected to be the cheapest of the flip phones in Motorola's 2025 series.</p><p>The promotional images reveal at least three Motorola Razr 2025 colors, including a sleek navy blue colorway with what appears to be a carbon-fiber-style finish and texture. The photos also show off a green finish with both light and darker tones, plus another colorway somewhere between silver and tan.</p><p>The latter color is only shown off via its side profile, making it unclear what exactly this finish will look like or be called.

<p>Official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">social media teasers from Motorola</a> revealed the apparent launch date for the Razr 2025, which is set for April 24. This is significantly earlier than Motorola's launch of the Razr 2024 and Razr Plus 2024 last year.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/major-motorola-razr-plus-2025-leak-hardware-changes">Per the latest rumors and leaks</a>, the regular Razr 2025 is set to keep its general form factor, while the Plus model is expected to pick up a few major upgrades. The Motorola Razr Plus 2025 could get a faster chip, bigger screen, and better main camera sensor. All the upgrades will be officially revealed later this week.</p>

<ul><li>Google is reportedly exploring a move for Pixel production from Vietnam to India.</li><li>It is also claimed to be interested in localizing certain Pixel components, like enclosures or fingerprint sensors, to Indian manufacturing plants.</li><li>The move is said to be related to the ongoing U.S. tariff situation, which is expected to levy higher charges on goods imported from Vietnam than India.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The U.S. is currently exploring tariffs under the Trump administration that would directly impact products imported to the country, and the uncertain situation may be pushing Google to ramp up Pixel manufacturing in India. Google is reportedly considering moving the production of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel phone</a> components from Vietnam to India to thwart potentially-major tariffs, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/alphabet-inc-shifts-google-pixel-production-from-vietnam-to-india-amid-us-tariff-concerns/articleshow/120496733.cms" target="_blank">The Economic Times</a>.</p><p>The report claims that Google is in talks with Dixon Technologies and Foxconn to move parts of Pixel production to India, "especially devices headed for the U.S." The news comes via two industry executives who spoke to The Economic Times, saying that discussions started about two weeks ago. These talks would be the first step in transitioning parts of Pixel production from Vietnam to India, which could be a large undertaking.</p><p>However, there appears to be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/could-we-be-the-reason-for-google-increasing-its-phone-prices">major financial incentive for Google</a> and its partners to make a move. While goods imported to the U.S. from Vietnam — where most Pixel phone production takes place — are subject to a 46% tariff, those imported from India are only subject to a 26% tariff. It's worth noting that both tariffs, called reciprocal tariffs, are currently paused for 90 days and are not in effect.</p>

<p>The situation is currently ongoing and subject to change, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance as recently as yesterday, April 21, attempting to reach a trade deal that avoids reciprocal tariffs. Indian Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that India hopes to reach a trade deal with the U.S. by this fall, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/indias-modi-host-jd-vance-delhi-under-us-tariffs-shadow-2025-04-21/" target="_blank">Reuters</a>. The U.S. is the country's largest trading partner.</p><p>As such, there may be even greater incentive for Google to relocate some aspects of Pixel production from Vietnam to India. Specifically, the company is reportedly interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-has-reportedly-finished-designing-the-pixel-10s-custom-tensor-g5-soc">creating certain components</a> in the country. These could include "enclosures, chargers, fingerprint sensors and batteries," per the Economic Times report.</p><p>Currently, even Pixel phones manufactured in India are using components mostly imported from foreign countries.</p>

<ul><li>One UI 8 introduces 3D avatars in the weather app that react to forecasts, featuring enhanced elements like jackets, caps, and umbrellas.</li><li>The app boasts improved animations and realistic backgrounds with beautiful landscapes, though most categories and data points remain similar to the current version.</li><li>On the other hand, the One UI 7 has begun rolling out in regions like Korea, the U.S., and the U.K.; users in India and Germany are still awaiting the update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While several Galaxy phone users in some regions still await the One UI 7 update, a new leak has revealed some of the new features that Samsung’s next operating system, the One UI 8, is bringing to the table.</p><p>One UI 8 has been spotted in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">several instances</a> over the past few weeks, and the latest leak has revealed Samsung’s new native weather app and enhanced design elements that it is bringing to the Galaxy users (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/22/one-ui-8-weather-app/">9to5Google</a>). An X user, Gerwin van Giessen, has shared a couple of screenshots of the One UI 8 Weather app alongside a Reddit user who has shared the app in action.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Samsung's new weather app looks very interesting. Thank you @Feruzbek_101 for sharing the original apk. This is an .apk that should be able to be installed on any device: https://t.co/n8B4s0xeU1#Samsung #OneUI #OneUI8 pic.twitter.com/7VOBzryefi<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1914525340585623846">April 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The most notable change is the new 3D avatars that react to the forecast. While the previous iterations gave a flat look to the avatar animation, the One UI 8 weather app adds a 3D look, which certainly appears interesting. Alongside the 3D look, the avatars also carry certain elements like a jacket, a cap, or an umbrella, which also look more enhanced and complement the forecast than before, and appear pretty cool to look at.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui/comments/1k50g98/one_ui_8_weather_app">One UI 8 Weather app</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneui">r/oneui</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>The animations while sliding through other aspects of the One UI 8 app also appear to be improved over the current model. Alongside the avatars, the background also appears realistic with beautiful landscapes, which is a new addition. However, most of the categories and data points look similar to the current version of the native Weather app.</p><p>It is still unclear why Samsung hasn’t included the new weather app in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> despite bringing numerous changes to the operating system. And the One UI 7 rollout, on the other hand, has been kind of wonky as Samsung has begun rolling out the update as promised early this month, but only for certain regions like Korea, the U.S., and the U.K. Meanwhile, Galaxy S24 series users in regions like India and Germany are still waiting for the much-anticipated One UI 7 update.</p>

With availability beginning today, as well, Samsung states consumers will be granted "the same one-year limited warranty offered on new smartphones." Additionally, consumers can grab <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-care-plus-vs-applecare-plus">Samsung Care Plus</a> alongside the Theft & Loss add-on, if they'd like.</p><p>On the other side, the Korean OEM reiterates the hallmarks of its Certified Re-newed lineup. Like all others, the Galaxy S24 series has been given 100% authentic parts with a brand-new battery, too.</p><p>The post highlights some major features the Galaxy S24 series offers, like Galaxy AI. We're all aware of Samsung's intense focus on creating the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-discusses-the-ai-phone-future">AI Phone</a>," and its past-gen series is no different. The Galaxy S24 delivers Photo Assist for "next-level" photo edits and Note Assist, which summarizes content for users in neat bullet points. Of course, there are others brought on by Google, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-circle-to-search-ai-powered-multisearch-rollout">Circle to Search</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Samsung Wallet</a> is there for Certified Re-newed Galaxy S24 users for a one-stop shop full of your important cards and IDs.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-77">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google Photos is rolling out Ultra HDR, replacing the old HDR effect with a feature that boosts brightness and colors in your pictures.</li><li>You can now add HDR to old photos, no matter when they were taken.</li><li>In version 7.24.0.747539053, Ultra HDR is tucked in the “Adjust” tab, taking over the old HDR spot.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google Photos is rolling out its new Ultra HDR feature, kicking the old HDR effect to the curb. This upgrade lets you pump up the brightness and colors in your pictures.</p><p>This new feature has already started showing up for some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> users, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-photos-ultra-hdr-option-rollout-3546251/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>. Since only a few folks have it so far, it looks like Google is rolling it out on the server side. This also means it should arrive for more devices pretty soon.</p><p>If you have a ton of old photos that could use a little extra pop, Google Photos has your back. Its new feature goes beyond the usual edits in that it lets you add HDR magic to pics you’ve already taken, no matter when or how you shot them.</p>
<h2 id="rescue-your-old-pictures-2">Rescue your old pictures</h2>
<p>The latest change comes after the tech giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ultra-hdr-support-spotted">laid the groundwork with Ultra HDR support in Android 14</a> and Google Photos last year. The full-on Ultra HDR editing tool inside the app is a solid upgrade that finally lets users tap into the full power of this next-level feature.</p><p>In Google Photos version 7.24.0.747539053, the Ultra HDR option lives in the “Adjust” tab, taking over where the old HDR effect used to be.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:389px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:222.11%;"><img id="NbejfDTFQHf2rZdHpYQ7KW" name="Google-Photos-Ultra-HDR-tool" alt="Ultra HDR editing tool in Google Photos" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NbejfDTFQHf2rZdHpYQ7KW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="389" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Authority found that when Ultra HDR is applied, you’ll see a new “Ultra HDR” tag in the image metadata, right near the resolution and file size details.</p><p>Interestingly, the Ultra HDR version can actually be smaller in size than the original. That’s because it uses a compact gain map instead of duplicating the whole image. Still, if you want to hang onto all the original details, it’s a good idea to keep the original file too, just in case.</p><p>Ultra HDR is a fresh take on photo encoding that packs in way more detail, meaning brighter highlights, deeper shadows, and richer colors. What’s cool is that it also includes a standard version (SDR) baked into the same file. So even if someone is using a screen that doesn’t support HDR, they’ll still see a solid, true-to-life version of the image.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-82">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung's foldable plans have shifted, with the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and tri-fold now tipped for a Q4 2025 release instead of mid-2025.</li><li>Samsung is said to be focusing on flagship models first, with panel production for the Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 already underway this month, before shifting to the FE and tri-fold.</li><li>The Z Flip 7 FE will likely keep the classic folder design but ditch the large external screen of the flagship model for a smaller one, in line with its more affordable pricing.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung’s foldable plans may have taken an unexpected turn. A new report from South Korea says the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and the ambitious tri-fold phone won’t be landing as soon as we thought. Originally pegged for a mid-2025 drop alongside the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, both devices have reportedly been pushed back.</p><p>The buzz around Samsung’s expanded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable lineup</a> this year is taking shape, no doubt. While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> and Z Fold 7 are expected to build on what’s already been done, the addition of two new devices—a tri-fold similar to Huawei’s Mate X series and a more budget-friendly flip phone—brings something fresh to the table.</p><p>This move not only adds variety to Samsung’s offerings but also kicks the competition up a notch, as the company looks to appeal to a wider range of customers.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD" name="samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-render-closed" alt="A leaked look at a minty green Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE closed." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cmRnQpbYpxMWTZfbTSxGGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1668" height="938" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SammyGuru)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, a report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://thebell.co.kr/free/content/ArticleView.asp?key=202504162329253040101110&lcode=00&page=1&svccode=00" target="_blank">The Bell</a> reveals that the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE and Samsung’s new tri-fold phone won’t be making their debut until Q4 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Galaxy-Z-Flip-FE-and-tri-fold-phone-reportedly-delayed-to-Q4-2025.1002684.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). This means the more budget-friendly Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, which was supposed to drop alongside the Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 at Samsung’s July Unpacked event, will now have us waiting a little longer.</p>
<h2 id="flagships-first-2">Flagships first</h2>
<p>Interestingly, the same report also says that Samsung has already started making panels for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7 this month. While it’s not clear if that’s the reason for the delay, it looks like Samsung is putting its focus on getting the flagship models out first.</p><p>After that, the company will likely shift gears to work on the more affordable FE version and the new tri-fold.</p><p>Earlier reports hinted that the Flip FE would arrive a few months after the flagship Flip 7, but now we’ve got a clearer picture. This new timeline gives us a solid reference point, unlike the vague hints we had before about when the budget-friendly foldable would finally hit the market.</p>
<h2 id="budget-cuts-literally-2">Budget cuts (literally) </h2>
<p>From <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">earlier leaks</a>, we’re starting to get a good idea of what the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE will look like. The design seems to stick with the familiar folder-like style, similar to the current Z Flip models.</p><p>However, it looks like the FE won’t have the big, camera-covering external display that’s expected on the flagship Z Flip 7. Instead, it’ll likely keep the smaller external screen we’ve seen before, which makes sense given its more budget-friendly price tag.</p><p>When it comes to what's inside, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is expected to pack either the Exynos 2500 or Exynos 2400 chip, while the flagship Z Flip 7 will likely run on the more powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-87">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One UI 7 is finally here for Galaxy S23 users, starting in South Korea.</li><li>The update includes April 2025 security patch and comes with build numbers like S918NKSU6DYD9.</li><li>Other Galaxy devices are joining in, including the S24 FE, Tab S10 Plus, Tab S9 series, Z Fold 5, and Z Flip 5.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After a bit of a wait, the final version of One UI 7 is finally making its way to Galaxy S23 devices, though for now, it’s only rolling out in South Korea.</p><p>The stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> update is now hitting Galaxy S23 units in South Korea, specifically for those who were part of the beta test, as per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s23-stable-one-ui-7-android-15-update-released-korea/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. Chances are, Samsung is sticking to its usual playbook globally, giving beta testers first dibs on the stable version before rolling it out to the rest of the crowd.</p><p>The latest update for the Galaxy S23 lineup comes with build numbers S918NKSU6DYD9, S918NOKR6DYD9, and S918NKSU6DYD9. If you were part of the beta crew, the update is a light 1GB download. But if you sat out the beta, expect a heftier 5GB package. Furthermore, it also packs the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">April 2025 security patch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="more-devices-joining-2">More devices joining</h2>
<p>In addition to the Galaxy S23 series, tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33" target="_blank">Tarun Vats</a> over on X says the One UI 7 OTA update is also hitting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Galaxy S24 FE</a>, Tab S10 Plus, Tab S9 series, Z Fold 5, and Z Flip 5 in South Korea.</p>
<h2 id="the-now-bar-is-a-game-changer-2">The Now Bar is a game-changer</h2>
<p>One UI 7 marks a major leap forward, packing in tons of fresh features. The new Now Bar alone changes how you interact with your Galaxy. This always-visible dashboard keeps your music, recordings, timers, and other active tools literally at your fingertips, while deeper customization options finally let you make your phone feel truly personal.</p>

<p>On top of that, One UI 7 brings a full-on home screen makeover. We’re talking fresh app icons, a sleeker quick panel, a brand-new default font, a bunch of new One UI widgets, and a bunch of other visual and usability upgrades to tie it all together.</p><p>With the stable release now live, Samsung has officially wrapped up the One UI 7.0 Beta Program for the Galaxy S23 series. If you're in South Korea and rocking an S23, just head to Settings > Software update > Download and install to check if it’s ready for you.</p>

<p>Google Messages is kicking off the rollout of smart alerts for sensitive images. Basically, if it spots something that looks like nudity, it’ll blur it out automatically before the recipients even open it.</p><p>This privacy-first feature has been simmering behind the scenes for quite some time. Google first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">gave us a preview of it last year</a>, aiming for a February launch. Fast forward to now, and it’s finally starting to show up, but only in the beta version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a> and just for a small group of users, per <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/google-messages-sensitive-content-warnings-live/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>.</p><p>The Sensitive Content Warning is opt-in, so you'll need to turn it on yourself. Once it’s active, it acts like a little checkpoint that flags potential nudes before they load and gives you a heads-up, plus some helpful info and options.</p>
<h2 id="you-sure-about-that-warnings-2">'You sure about that?' warnings</h2>
<p>When you get this warning, you’ve got three choices: go ahead and view the image, block the sender, or check out why it was flagged in the first place. If you do choose to view it, you’ll also get the option to blur it again later, which is handy if someone else grabs your phone for a brief moment.</p><p>If you’re about to send a risky picture yourself, it’ll also drop a quick warning to let you know what you’re getting into.</p>

<p>Sensitive Content Warnings work a bit differently depending on your age. While adults have to turn it on themselves, for teens, it’s switched on by default. If it’s a supervised account, like one managed by a parent through Google’s Family Link, you can’t turn it off at all. But if you're a teen (13–17) with an unsupervised account, you can go into your settings and switch it off manually if you want.</p>
<h2 id="your-device-your-privacy-2">Your device, your privacy</h2>
<p>A key thing to highlight is that everything happens right on your device. Thanks to Android’s SafetyCore, the app handles all the scanning and results locally, with zero data being sent to Google’s servers.</p><p>Since all the scanning happens on your device, Google makes it clear that it is not seeing your photos or sending anything out. Plus, it doesn’t mess with RCS’s end-to-end encryption, so your messages stay fully locked down.</p><p>That said, this feature only covers still images (videos are not included) and only activates when a supported app, like Messages, makes the request.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>I dislike Google TV with a passion; Google took a clean Android TV interface and riddled it with ads and unwanted recommendations. That's why I still use the Shield TV Pro — it's the one Android TV box that actually does a good job, and doesn't automatically lag if you use the TV for more than a few minutes. <br><br>Regardless of whether it's high-end projectors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/xgimi-aura-2-is-the-ultimate-ust-upgrade">XGIMI Aura 2</a> or budget TVs, Google TV just doesn't feel great to use. Indian brand Lumio is looking to change that with the debut of its TVs; the brand rolled out the QLED Vision 7 and the Mini-LED Vision 9 in the country earlier this month, and both models have plenty of differentiated features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJfz83p9UYTxAfhtbPfke4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJfz83p9UYTxAfhtbPfke4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But what I like the most about Lumio is the software; it's still using Google TV, but the brand outfitted all of its TVs — even the base model — with 3GB of DDR4 memory, and it made several tweaks to the interface to make it fluid. The result is the only TV I've ever used that doesn't feel slow; Lumio is calling its products the fastest TVs in India, and that is actually true.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fm4kfJr5rMR2NVNh2vKfm4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fm4kfJr5rMR2NVNh2vKfm4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lumio says that its TVs will continue to be fast even after several years, and that's something I will put to the test. While Lumio itself is a new entity, it consists of Xiaomi India veterans, and it's clear that the brand knows what it's doing in this category — and has the requisite manufacturing contacts and after-sales network to go up against established manufacturers.</p><p>In fact, Lumio's TVs are manufactured at Dixon — the same as Xiaomi. What's great to see is that there's a standard two-year warranty on all of Lumio's TVs, and the brand established an after-sales network in the country.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GxHaYiniUngPsMBHa3jVd4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GxHaYiniUngPsMBHa3jVd4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can't talk much about the quality of the hardware as I was sent a pre-production unit for testing, but the picture quality itself is among the best in its segment. The Vision 9 in particular is a good choice, going up to 550 nits in regular use and 900 nits with HDR content. It handles Dolby Vision and HDR content well, and it has a dedicated quantum dot layer with 2,000 mini LEDs housed inside the panel.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBYuoLGshoD9gLCAMvrms4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBYuoLGshoD9gLCAMvrms4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lumio did a decent job with its image engine, and colors are calibrated out of the box. Sound quality is pretty decent as well, and Lumio managed to deliver a clean sound that doesn't distort even at high volumes. The Vision 7 is a great value, delivering 400 nits and a dedicated quantum dot layer. Clearly, Lumio is aiming to differentiate its devices with the picture quality, and being a new brand taking on much bigger rivals like Xiaomi, it needed to do that.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="MBcVHGJwjeUEQRscGoXmr4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MBcVHGJwjeUEQRscGoXmr4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The TVs get HDMI 2.1 ports as standard too, but the key omission is variable refresh — they're locked to 60Hz. That's annoying as the rest of the hardware is quite decent, and Lumio says it is targeting a mainstream audience with the Vision 7 and Vision 9, so it didn't include VRR. That's also the reason why the Vision 9 is only available in a 55-inch variant, with the Vision 7 retailing in 43 inch, 50 inch, and 55 inches.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="imzeW9kHRkKuHZftrJ2ob4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/imzeW9kHRkKuHZftrJ2ob4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's entirely likely we'll get a 65-inch model down the line with VRR, but at launch, the size is limited to 55 inches. That isn't much of a downside considering the intended audience, and honestly, Lumio did a good job with the basics. On that note, the brand's TVs are powered by a quad-core silicon that uses Cortex A75 cores, and it gets AV1 decode as standard — a necessity these days.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AbAeewyYL29sEEtRhyUwX4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AbAeewyYL29sEEtRhyUwX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now, the biggest differentiator with Lumio's TVs is the software; the Google TV interface is much better to use than just about any other TV I used, and that's no exaggeration. I use Xiaomi's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/xiaomi-mi-qled-tv-75-review">75-inch Mi QLED TV 75</a> in my living room, and it has been a constant source of frustration. It regularly freezes with the most mundane of tasks — powering on and switching sources to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/nvidias-shield-tv-pro-is-still-the-best-streaming-device-in-2024">Shield TV Pro</a> — and I have to cold reset the TV every other day.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sURsvoVjSSAeSMARov5BX4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sURsvoVjSSAeSMARov5BX4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Android TV interface on that TV is so slow that it just doesn't make sense to use Xiaomi's software, the panel quality is good enough that I continue to use it daily. That's why I'm excited about Lumio's entry into this category; even Sony, Samsung, and LG mid-range TVs have issues with stability and lag, and it's great to see a brand address that issue.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="CMHJNviwctDzG2dQUbZtg4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CMHJNviwctDzG2dQUbZtg4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another standout addition is TL;DR, a custom hub that pulls sports scores into a unified dashboard. It does a fantastic job, and offers a vast overview of the action across several leagues. Lumio is doing a similar thing with music as well, collating various sources so you can just listen to music without having to muddle through various playlists and services. The music tech plugs into YouTube Music as of now, but Lumio says it is trying to get other music providers onboard.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Cz5fiCZ5JcJWkQ4R2FX8r4" name="Lumio Vision" alt="Lumio Vision TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cz5fiCZ5JcJWkQ4R2FX8r4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, Lumio did all the right things with the Vision 9. It's aimed at a mainstream audience, but the TV has great picture quality, decent sound, and the best software of any TV around. What's noteworthy is that it made a Google TV product I actually want to use — now I just need Lumio to build a streamer to take on the Shield TV Pro.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-97">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Samsung is rolling out the April 2025 security update for the Galaxy S25 series in Australia, following its debut in Korea.</li><li>The update weighs 762MB, boosts security, and includes some tweaks, mainly system stability improvements.</li><li>New One UI 7 features are here, like a refreshed charging animation with a slick green glow on the battery icon.</li><li>The media player gets a facelift, with a live Now Bar in the top-left corner for easy access to playback controls.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>After rolling it out in Korea, Samsung is now kicking off the April 2025 security update for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra in Australia.</p><p>The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series update, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">first hit South Korea late last week</a>, weighs in at 762MB and bumps up security to April 2025. It sneaks in a couple of tweaks—though Samsung’s official notes only mention improved system stability.</p>
<h2 id="a-fresh-charging-animation-2">A fresh charging animation</h2>
<p>As noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1914184457273090505" target="_blank">Tarun Vats on X</a>, the April 2025 update brings a few fresh One UI 7-style features to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">latest and greatest Samsung phones</a>. One standout is the revamped charging animation (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-april-2025-update-expansion/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>). Once exclusive to One UI 7 Beta testers, it is now rolling out to S25 owners.</p><p>This means that the battery icon up top on the right now gets a slick animated glow with a green background. It’s a much cleaner, more polished look than what shipped with the Galaxy S25 at launch.</p><p>The update also refreshes the media player in the notification panel. Now, when you're playing something, a live Now Bar pops up in the top-left corner showing what’s playing. Tap it, and you get full playback controls.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3488px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-19" alt="Not Bar on the Galaxy S25 Plus with music controls" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/txrzkVYDwfWq6W7MEWrDsL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3488" height="1962" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As with previous software versions, the media widget still lives in the Quick Settings panel. Both of these new tweaks are already part of the stable One UI 7 build running on the Galaxy S24 series.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-shuffled-priorities-2">Samsung shuffled priorities</h2>
<p>Samsung is usually quick with monthly security patches for its flagships, but this month has been a bit different. Instead of pushing the April update to the Galaxy S25 lineup right away, the company focused on finally getting the stable One UI 7 build out for its 2024 flagships, which had been running fashionably late.</p><p>After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s24-series-one-ui-7-rollout-continues-new-build">pushing out the Android 15 update for Galaxy S24 devices</a>, Samsung is now turning its attention to the S25 series with April's security patch.</p><p>To spot the latest Galaxy S25 update, look for a build number that ends in AYD9. To install it, open Settings, tap on Software update, and then hit Download and install.</p>

<p>It's hard to believe, but we're likely just months away from Samsung releasing a new foldable: the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7. As the expected launch window gets closer, more rumors and leaks will continue to roll in, giving us a better picture of what the upcoming foldable might offer.</p><p>Aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7's expected price point and specs, buyers are going to want to know how the phone will shake up against major competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. That's why we're here to provide an early, speculative look at how these two phones compare based on current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumors and leaks</a>. Let's dive in!</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AFKgVKgEBrWZkAbDja2ruS" name="pixel-9-pro-fold-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-screens-on-crease.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Galaxy Z Fold 6 crease comparison with screens on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AFKgVKgEBrWZkAbDja2ruS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold and Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 crease comparison with their screens on. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, the thing everyone wants to know about the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">when the foldable will be released</a>. If we use the Galaxy Z Fold 6 release window as a gauge, it's likely that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be revealed sometime around July 2025. Unless something changes, we can guess that Samsung will almost certainly hold a Galaxy Unpacked event around that time, where the Galaxy Z Fold 7, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, and perhaps other products will be revealed.</p><p>As for price, it appears that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could bring along a price hike compared to the $1,899 Galaxy Z Fold 6. This might be attributed to the rumored new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chip inside, which has a higher cost for manufacturers.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold was released in Fall 2024 at a starting price of $1,799. You can get it in either 256GB or 512GB storage configurations, and in Porcelain or Obsidian colorways. We'll likely see more Pixel 9 Pro Fold deals and discounts as the phone gets older.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7's design and displays are two areas of the smartphone that have been prominently leaked ahead of its official reveal. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>, the image above is a CAD rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7. While it might not look like a major visual departure from the Galaxy Z Fold 6, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-z-fold-7-could-actually-be-the-upgrade-weve-been-waiting-for">there's more than meets the eye here</a>.</p><p>For starters, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to offer two new OLED panels that are bigger than those on the previous model. The main, foldable screen is said to be an 8.2-inch OLED panel this year, possibly of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">creaseless variant Samsung showed off at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>. On the outside, there is expected to be a 6.5-inch OLED cover screen.</p><p>It may also be the thinnest Samsung foldable ever, per the latest leaks and rumors. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded, making it thinner than even the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold, which measures 150.2 x 155.2 x 5.1 mm.</p><p>It could also be a few grams lighter this year, with current estimations listing the Galaxy Z Fold 7 at 236 grams. That's significantly lighter than the 257-gram Pixel 9 Pro Fold.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold features an 8-inch main screen by comparison. It's an OLED, LTPO panel supporting variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz. The panel is bright, supporting up to 2,700 nits peak brightness. On the outside, you get a similar 6.3-inch OLED cover screen, but this time with variable refresh rates ranging from 60 to 120Hz.</p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold features a sleek design with flat side rails and curved corners, whereas the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to retain its boxy, rectangular design.</p>

<p>On the inside, the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold is powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4 chipset</a> and 16GB of RAM. That's expected to be more memory than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will offer, as it is rumored to stick with 12GB. However, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is tipped to use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> — possibly even a "for-Galaxy" variant. That should ensure that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 handily beats the Pixel 9 Pro Fold in gaming and general performance.</p>

<p>Current rumors predict that Samsung won't change the Galaxy Z Fold 7's charging or battery specifications, sticking with a 4,400mAh capacity. It'll also supposedly keep its 25W wired charging speed. Both figures are less than what the Pixel 9 Pro Fold offers, with 45W wired charging speeds and a 4,650mAh capacity.</p>

<p>For the first time in a while, Samsung is expected to upgrade the main camera sensor on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. In all likelihood, it'll be the same 200MP main sensor found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> launched in China and Korea. It'll likely be joined by the same 12MP ultrawide and 10MP telephoto lens as the current Galaxy Z Fold 6. The latter will enable 3x optical zoom.</p><p>How does that stack up against the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-saw-the-northern-lights-for-the-first-time-thanks-to-the-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold's cameras</a>? Google's foldable device offers a 48MP primary camera, paired with a 10.5MP ultrawide lens and a 10.8MP telephoto lens. That telephoto lens notably offers 5x optical zoom, which is more than the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to offer. While the 48MP primary camera may sound inferior to the 200MP camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, sensor size and other specifications will help determine which one is truly the best.</p>

<p>Samsung's foldable lineup has become known for its incremental upgrades, which don't amount to much from generation to generation. However, if you wait two or three years for upgrades to accumulate, a new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold device becomes significantly more appealing. So, how does the unreleased Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 factor into this pattern?</p><p>With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, Samsung is expected to provide a few tangible upgrades that will make it a compelling foldable compared to prior models. Current rumors and leaks suggest that this generation will feature larger screens, a chip upgrade, and a new camera. That could make it an enticing upgrade for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Galaxy Z Fold 5</a> owners. Let's break down how these two models might compare in this early look.</p>
<h2 id="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-vs-galaxy-z-fold-5-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 vs. Galaxy Z Fold 5: Pricing and availability</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-15.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs Fold 5 crease" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gMaGt99dEXzJNzg2UkMEhP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung typically hosts two Galaxy Unpacked events each year — one just after the new year and another in midsummer. The latter is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">where we expect to see the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 announced</a>, most likely in July 2025. Per recent leaks, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may arrive with a price hike compared to its predecessor, which retailed for $1,899.</p><p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a powerful but expensive processor, could be the reason for the rumored price increase. This would be a price hike beyond the raised prices announced last year with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The previous model, the Galaxy Z Fold 5, cost $1,799 in 2023.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 was available in 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage configurations, which are the same we expect to see on the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1409px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.78%;"><img id="pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-floating" alt="A supposed rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7, showing its real panel with a vertical triple camera array." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzn8rm9jE97UerXLRbiKtU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1409" height="786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>According to leaks, both the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are expected to have a similar appearance, featuring a triple-camera system on the back. However, that's where the similarities end. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 may adopt the new, boxy and rectangular design introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It may also feature a redesigned hinge that closes completely flat, whereas the Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have a slight gap between the two displays when closed.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 also sports the narrower cover display, measuring 6.2 inches with a 1:9 aspect ratio. Meanwhile, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to offer a wider 6.5-inch OLED panel. We can likely expect the Galaxy Z Fold 7's cover screen to match the specifications of recent Galaxy foldables, such as Dynamic AMOLED 2x and variable refresh rates between 1 and 120Hz.</p>

<p>The outer display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is tipped to be larger, too. Current rumors indicate Samsung will add an 8.2-inch foldable OLED this year, and it's possible this display will have no visible crease. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">previewed a creaseless foldable display at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>, but it has not been confirmed to arrive on the Galaxy Z Fold 7. By comparison, the Galaxy Z Fold 5 only offers a 7.6-inch foldable screen.</p><p>According to an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report, the image below represents a CAD rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 design. The foldable is set to measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded and weigh just 136 grams. These leaked dimensions indicate that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 may be significantly thinner and lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5, which measures 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6mm when unfolded and weighs 253 grams.</p>

<p>For the first time, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to be one of the first Samsung phones to ship with a new version of Android. It's said to launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors">One UI 8</a>, which will be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. This is made possible due to Google's new rollout pace for Android, which sees new version upgrades released in the second quarter of each year.</p><p>The phone will reportedly be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, which brings overall improvements and superior AI processing. It's a big upgrade over the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy, which powers the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, current rumors predict that both the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Fold 5 will have the same battery capacity and charging speeds. The Galaxy Z Fold 5 has a 4,400mAh capacity and can charge at up to 25W wired, and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 isn't expected to improve on those figures.</p>

<p>Samsung has been notoriously complacent with its foldable cameras, but that's finally starting to change this year. The company is expected to swap the main camera on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 in favor of a new 200MP sensor. Rumors suggest that the 200MP primary camera on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> — exclusively sold in China and Korea — will be introduced to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 globally.</p><p>It replaces the old 50MP primary camera sensor found on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Fold 5. Otherwise, the Galaxy Z Fold 7's camera hardware is rumored to be the same as the Galaxy Z Fold 5's lenses. That means both devices would have a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto lens with up to 3x optical zoom.</p><p>We haven't heard anything about Samsung changing up the front-facing cameras, so these will likely be the same 10MP cover camera and 4MP under-display camera we're familiar with on the Galaxy Z Fold 5.</p>

<p>For existing Galaxy Z Fold 5 owners, the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to bring along major changes that might be worth an upgrade. It may be significantly thinner and more durable, with advanced foldable display technologies, a better hinge, and dust resistance. The likely chip upgrade, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a>, and rumored 200MP primary camera round out the improved experience.</p><p>However, it's a tall ask to pay potentially more than $1,899 on a new phone just two years after investing $1,799 in a Galaxy Z Fold 5. That's even tougher when you consider that the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Galaxy Z Fold 7 are expected to have the same charging speeds and battery capacity. As such, it's far from a slam-dunk upgrade at the moment — but plenty can change ahead of Samsung's official announcement this summer.</p>

<hr>
<p>If Dory can talk to a whale, then why can we bridge the gap of communication with real dolphins? Seems like Google and a group of scientists have been hard at work trying to make sense of the squeaks and clicks of these aquatic mammals.</p><p>For National Dolphin Day earlier this month, Google, in collaboration with researchers at Georgia Tech and the field research of the Wild Dolphin Project (WDP), has been working on training a large language learning model called DolphinGemma. This LLM is helping scientists study how dolphins communicate — and in the future, it could find out what they're saying, too.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="V3NuAg7JosWzaA5UNV5Vf7" name="Dolphin-gemma" alt="DolphinGemma" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V3NuAg7JosWzaA5UNV5Vf7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/dolphingemma/">Keyword blog</a> states that the primary focus of WDP is observing and analyzing the dolphins' communication and social interactions. For instance, they have been able to correlate certain sounds with behaviors of these mammals. For instance, signature whistles (unique names) are usually used by mother dolphins to reunite with their young, while burst-pulse "squawks" are often seen during fights, and "Click buzzes" are often used during courtship or chasing sharks.</p><p>Where does the AI come in, you ask? Building on its open-source <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-launches-gemma-open-model">Gemma</a> model, Google has created DolphinGemma, which is essentially an AI that processes audio that it receives.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T8GdEVVvXyE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>WDP scientists have collected tons of acoustics of wild Atlantic spotted dolphins, and to help them interpret them better, these clicks and squawks are fed to the LLM.</p><p>After that, the AI model looks for patterns in these sounds. For instance, if a squawk is followed by two whistles, how often is the dolphin "communicating" that way? What's more is that once DolphinGemma understands these patterns, it will try to predict the sound that the dolphin might make next.</p><p>DolphinGemma is making it easier for scientists to spot these patterns, lessening the need for human intervention, which would essentially take longer. "The model can help researchers uncover hidden structures and potential meanings within the dolphins' natural communication," the post added.</p>

<hr>
<p>After a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-wear-os-5-1-update-mess-has-me-annoyed-and-looking-for-solutions">messy March update rollout</a>, Google plans to finally merge Pixel Watch owners onto one late-April Wear OS 5.1 versuib — and remove a key feature from Wear OS that isn't working as intended.</p><p>The March Pixel Watch update added several new features, including a new "enhanced step count algorithm" designed to better track steps in "challenging situations" like using a walking stick, stroller, shopping cart, or wheelchair.</p><p>Unfortunately, it also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/wear-os-5-1-seems-to-have-come-with-multiple-bugs">triggered several bugs</a> on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> units like delayed notifications, battery drain, and artificially inflated step counts for some users. And many Pixel Watch owners never received it.</p><p>In early April, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/google-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-pixel-watch-models">pushed an update</a> to fix the battery and notification issues; now, this latest update, "BP1A.250305.019.W8," will fix the step-counting issue by returning to the old algorithm.</p>

<p>People stuck on the old November 2024 patch will receive the <em>other</em> March 2025 features: menstrual tracking in Fitbit, a media controls upgrade, new dev tools, some UI changes, auto bed-time mode on the Pixel Watch 2, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/pixel-watch/2025/2025-03-01">high-severity security fixes</a>. Only the step count algorithm algorithm is excluded.</p><p>Google promises that you'll receive a smartwatch notification when the update becomes available. If you want to check for it now, put your Pixel Watch on a charger, go to Settings > System > System Update, and rapidly tap the screen for about 15–30 seconds to see if the update appears.</p><p>Based on past Pixel Watch update rollouts, older models or LTE models will take longer to receive this April 2025 Wear OS patch.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">I tested my Pixel Watch 3's step count accuracy using these trekking poles. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ironically, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-wear-os-5-1-step-count-algorithm-accuracy-pixel-watch-3">tested the enhanced step count algorithm</a> on my Pixel Watch 3 last week. I knew Wear OS 5.1 had caused some bugs, but didn't know that people's watches were adding tens of thousands of steps or tracking movement while removed.</p><p>Despite my ignorance, I approached my test with some skepticism about whether Google's "exceptional accuracy" claim was true, and I put it through some tough tests.</p><p>My results weren't perfect, but in every scenario, my step count was <em>below</em> the actual step count. It was 100 steps short after 10,000 steps, 143 steps short after hiking up hills with a trekking pole, and a couple hundred steps short while walking through a store with a shopping cart.</p><p>My takeaway was that the algorithm had room to grow, but that it did a decent job of recognizing abnormal step movements, better than other brands that can only interpret natural arm swings as steps. And I appreciated that Google was trying to account for scenarios like pushing a wheelchair, stroller, or walker, not just able-bodied athletes.</p><p>That's why I find it a shame that Google has reverted to the old algorithm, which we've typically found to be less accurate for <em>normal</em> step tracking. I asked my Google rep about what "certain scenarios" were causing issues and why the algorithm had to be reverted rather than fixed; I'll update this post if I hear back.</p><p>Hopefully, they'll be able to re-add the enhanced algorithm in the future, resolving the source of the false-positive steps while still helping Pixel Watches to recognize unorthodox steps and movement.</p>

<p>While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 didn't bring major upgrades over its predecessor, there's a chance that the upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 might be a different story. We expect Samsung to release its next big-screen foldable sometime this summer, and leaks and rumors shed light on the upgrades set to arrive.</p><p>But will the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> be a worthwhile upgrade over the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>? There may be enough changes to warrant an upgrade, with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 expected to feature a chip upgrade, a new camera sensor, and larger displays. However, the price might make it cost-prohibitive to purchase. Let's break down how these two devices will shake up in this early, speculative comparison.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1405px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="bcSKm4AWGgRu9KjHXe5SxP" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-leaked-rendering-front-back" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Z Fold 7's internal display, rear panel, and cover screen." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bcSKm4AWGgRu9KjHXe5SxP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1405" height="790" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like the Galaxy Z Fold 6, we're expecting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-release-date">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 to be officially revealed</a> at a Galaxy Unpacked event sometime this summer. It could be in July 2025, which tracks with past Galaxy Z Fold releases. According to the latest predictions, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could cost more than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which is priced at $1,899. The price hike could be a result of the new Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset.</p><p>Currently, you can buy the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starting at $1,899, with three different storage configurations available: 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB. It's available in Silver, Shadow, Pink, and Navy colorways.</p>

<p>Looking at the leaked CAD renderings for the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>), you might not notice a ton of changes compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Samsung appears to be retaining a similar design language, with flat sides and sharp corners. That said, while the rear camera arrangement looks similar, virtually everything else is different.</p><p>The differences start with the Galaxy Z Fold 7 allegedly offering a much thinner profile than the Galaxy Z Fold 6. The foldable phone will reportedly measure 158.4 x 143.1 x 4.5mm when unfolded, making it the thinnest Samsung foldable to date. While not thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Honor Magic V3</a>, it could be the thinnest foldable in the U.S. It may also be slightly lighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 6, weighing in at 236g.</p><p>Compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, which measures 132.6 x 153.5 x 5.6 mm, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 could be a considerable improvement.</p>

<p>The upgrades don't stop there. The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to ship with a bigger main screen and cover screen. The foldable, inner panel is rumored to grow to 8.2 inches this year, and it's possible that it has a creaseless look, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">the version previewed by Samsung at MWC Barcelona 2025</a>. On the outside, the cover screen will apparently be a 6.5-inch panel.</p><p>While we don't know the exact specifications of the displays yet, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 might give us some idea. The current model sports a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2x inner display with a variable refresh rate between 1 and 120Hz. On the outside, there's a 6.3-inch cover screen with the same specs, but higher pixel density. It's likely that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 will retain many of these specifications.</p>

<p>Samsung is also expected to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm's newest Snapdragon 8 Elite chip</a> to the Galaxy Z Fold 7. This upgraded processor is capable of handling more demanding AI tasks and features Qualcomm's best custom Oryon cores. It'll be superior to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy chip inside the current Galaxy Z Fold 6. However, the phone is rumored to have the same 12GB of available memory.</p><p>Despite the delays associated with Samsung's One UI 7 rollout, current rumors point to Samsung launching the Galaxy Z Fold 7 with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-one-ui-8-alleged-early-preview-report">One UI 8</a>, based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>.</p>

<p>The battery and charging specs appear to be unchanged, with Samsung unlikely to make changes between models. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is rumored to feature the same 4,400mAh capacity and 25W wired charging speeds. It's an underwhelming part of the Galaxy Z Fold 7's rumored specs for people hoping for faster charging and longer battery life.</p>

<p>For the past few generations, Samsung hasn't upgraded the camera system on the Galaxy Z Fold product line, aside from the Special Edition model. As of the Galaxy Z Fold 6 generation, the camera system still includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultrawide lens, and a 10MP telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. However, this appears to finally be changing with the Galaxy Z Fold 7.</p><p>Current rumors suggest that Samsung will utilize a 200MP main sensor on the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which could be the same sensor found on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-special-edition-vs-galaxy-z-fold-6" target="_blank">Galaxy Z Fold 6 Special Edition</a> — a premium variant exclusive to China and Korea. The other sensors are said to be unchanged, though, still remaining as a 12MP ultrawide and a 10MP telephoto. This is an improvement, but the secondary lenses still leave something to be desired.</p><p>There are no leaks or rumors suggesting the front-facing cameras will change, either. They'll likely remain a 10MP sensor for the cover display and a 4MP under-display lens for the folding display.</p>

<p>With the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 rumored to cost even more than the pricey Galaxy Z Fold 6, it probably won't make sense to upgrade if you already have the current model. That being said, users of earlier Galaxy Z Fold models — or those trying to buy a Samsung foldable for the first time — might be pleased by the Galaxy Z Fold 7's rumored upgrades.</p><p>Another factor to consider is that when the Galaxy Z Fold 7 officially releases, it's possible that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 will become massively discounted. As such, if you're willing to compromise a bit, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 could offer a better value proposition than the newer Galaxy Z Fold 7. Until Samsung officially debuts the Galaxy Z Fold 7, it's impossible to know the exact details.</p>

<p>In its usual Nothing way of things, the company dropped several social media posts showing off its upcoming CMF Phone Pro 2. For the past few days, Nothing has been teasing the phone, first giving us a close-up of the device's cameras, then the pictures it can click, the way the phone feels, and more.</p><p>Today, it released a video showcasing the phone from all angles, featuring the tagline "Playful and Powerful." As for the design,  the phone looks much like its predecessor; however, it comes with a powerful camera setup.</p><p>The company stated in its community forum that the phone is redesigned inside and out. As for the exterior, the CMF Phone Pro 2 features rounded corners and a triple camera array on its rear panel, accompanied by an LED flash positioned below the third lens, located off to the side. The camera lens appears to be encased in metallic rims, adding definition to its camera array.</p>

<ul><li>Lenovo has started teasing its Legion Tab (4th-gen) for consumers on Weibo, which confirms an 8.8-inch display, single-rear camera, and AI software.</li><li>Another teaser highlighted Lenovo's focus on making the next tablet even "thinner" and "lighter."</li><li>The company's AI for the next Legion Tab could focus on gaming, which was a strong focus for the 3rd-generation when it launched in January.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Lenovo is already teasing its next-gen small tablet on social media, which is shaping up to be thin and loaded with new features.</p><p>The company posted a couple of teasers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://h5.video.weibo.com/show/1034:5156720561815570">on Weibo</a> (Chinese), which involve a short video clip and a poster about its form factor (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/lenovo-legion-tab-y700-gen-4-ai-teaser/">9to5Google</a>). Lenovo's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5981912323/PofI451QY">image teaser</a> reportedly states its upcoming Legion Tab (4th Gen) will be "thinner" than its previous iteration and "lighter."</p><p>Specifics on both of these important specs are sitll unknown; however, Lenovo dives deeper into what consumers can expect in its video clip.</p><p>The highlight of the Legion Tab is its small form, which is how the video begins: showing a model pulling the tablet out of their pocket like a phone. The clip shows it in hand and an apparent single-camera lens on its back panel. The video also confirms the 4th-gen Legion Tab will feature an 8.8-inch display.</p><p>Lenovo teases AI software for its Legion Tab, too. The publication states its teaser highlights an upcoming feature dubbed "AI combat support." The running theory is that this could concern an assistant for mobile games like PUBG or League of Legends: Wild Rift.</p><p>That's unconfirmed at the moment in the teasers. The company then reportedly alluded to an upgrade in its SoC — and it seems Lenovo is sticking with flagship quality. The Chinese teaser suggests a "new Qualcomm" chip will enter the tablet, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>.</p>

<p>Rumors claim the next Legion Tab could launch in May (Chinese market first), and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/17/lenovo-legion-tab-2025-screen-battery-upgrades-report/">recent leak</a> speaks of its power supply. A prominent Weibo tipster suggested the tablet could pack a battery between 7,000mAh and 8,000mAh.</p><p>There are a few things that appear similar between the 4th and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovo-legion-tab-announced">3rd-gen Legion Tab</a>, which debuted back in January. First, the 8.8-inch display seems to live once again for the tablet while a single-rear camera was spotted, too. The latest tablet offered a 13MP camera. It seems likely we'd see that again, but we'll have to wait for more information. The battery of the 3rd-gen is also smaller than what we've seen rumored for the 4th-gen.</p><p>Lenovo's January launch offers a 6,500mAh battery with 45W fast charging. While we <em>could </em>see an expanded capacity, its charging remains unknown.</p><p>Moreover, gaming was a cornerstone with the last tablet, and Lenovo seems poised to focus on that aspect once more. The 3rd-gen tablet offers the Legion Coldfront Vapor Chamber for the influx of heat it generates during longer gaming sessions. This vapor chamber was said to enable gamers to go longer without worry. If Lenovo is looking to pack AI features, the next Legion Tab could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/redmagic-nova-gaming-tablet-international-launch-details">quite the secondary option</a> for tablet gamers.</p>

<p>For a flat pad, Belkin has made a comeback in the wireless charging space over the last year, with a variety of 10W and 15W wireless chargers that are Made for Google. They support the EPP charging profile used by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review" target="_blank">Google Pixel 9</a> and previous models, while also maintaining wireless charging profiles like those used by Samsung and Apple for their phones.</p><p>The Belkin 2-in-1 wireless charging pad features Qi2 15W charging technology and can charge both your Samsung and iPhone. Also, the 5W Qi pad can charge your AirPods at the same time.</p><p>The iOttie iON Wireless Duo is another good option, especially if you charge your true wireless earbuds next to your phone whenever possible. This stand supports 15W EPP charging to Pixel phones, and the design and texture are wonderfully premium for an entirely reasonable price.</p><p>The Anker MagSafe Charger Pad is an affordable and compact wireless charger that comes with a cable built in, so it's a clever and versatile little charger. You can use the latest charging technology to charge your iPhone. While this model is made specifically for iPhone, other chargers fall into the category of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones" target="_blank">best MagSafe accessories for Android</a>.</p><p>If you plan to use your wireless charger on the go, we recommend getting one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-qi-wireless-charging-power-banks">best Qi wireless portable chargers</a> in addition to a larger wireless charging pad or stand.</p>
<h2 id="some-things-to-take-note-of-before-buying-a-wireless-charger-2">Some things to take note of before buying a wireless charger</h2>
<p>Wireless chargers have a dozen different charging standards and protocols that are hard to condense down to a product name or a bullet-pointed list. Still, we've tried to sum up the most important things to know right here.</p><p>Let's start with the most important standards on a Qi charger, the actual charging specs:</p>
<ul><li><strong>15W EPP</strong>: This is the Qi Wireless Consortium's "Extended Power Profile," and it's a relatively open standard, the list of compatible phones continues to grow, including LG phones, the Google Pixel 5 and up, and the OnePlus 8 Pro and up (when not using OnePlus's charger for proprietary 30W or higher wireless charging).</li><li><strong>15W Samsung</strong>: This is technically the Samsung Fast Charge Wireless 2.0, and while still limited, there are some chargers with this speed specification outside of Samsung's own 15W Wireless Charger Stand.</li><li><strong>10W Qi</strong>: Of the 10W charging specs, the standard 10W is what most chargers and Android support. This can sometimes be using the EPP profile, sometimes it's not, and sometimes it's not the standard Qi because it's the Samsung profile instead.</li><li><strong>10W Samsung</strong>: This is technically Samsung Fast Charge 1.0, and for many wireless chargers, it's the 10W standard they refer to when they say they're a 10W charger. The charging speed you'll see on a compatible Samsung device is closer to 9W than 10W.</li><li><strong>7.5W Apple</strong>: 7.5W is the charging speed used for iPhones, and as such, it is now a standard charging speed offered on almost all wireless chargers. Wondering where the 15W Apple charging is? It's currently limited to first-party Apple chargers.</li><li><strong>5W Qi</strong>: This is the basic Qi profile that all Qi chargers are compatible with. Even if you can't fast-charge your phone with a specific charger, you can always get 5W charging if your device supports Qi charging.</li></ul>
<p>Since we haven't yet found a wireless charger that supports all of these, we have to try to pick a charger that meets the particular standards our devices can use now and in the future. If you're a Galaxy or iPhone user, your task is easy, since most chargers have your protocols. The rest of us should look for a charger with 15W EPP or 10W standard Qi charging.</p>

<p>While having gigantic batteries isn't new to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, the OnePlus seems to be achieving it in a rather compact form factor with the OnePlus 13T. The compactness comes from its 6.3-inch screen, lighter design, as the upcoming handset will weigh only 185 grams. Small-screen phones until now have not been so battery efficient, which was a major turn-off for those who preferred <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-small-android-phone">compact phones</a>.</p><p>It appears that shouldn't be the case with the OnePlus 13T as it is coming with a sizable battery. All thanks to OnePlus' proprietary <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery technology</a>, which was announced by the company last June. For the unaware, it is built upon the silicon carbon anode battery technology co-developed by OnePlus and Ningde New Energy — and tailored for high-performance phones.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13T is taking a good shape as it is going to be as compact as it can — and operating the device with one hand should be hassle-free. Alongside the massive battery, the device is also confirmed to be shipping with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> chipset and ColorOS out of the box. The upcoming handset is likely to have a matte finish and three possible wcolorways — Black, Pink, and Silver.</p><p>The device will feature rounded corners, and a new camera visor is seen from the teaser, which differs significantly from its other OnePlus 13 siblings. And, it incorporates dual camera lenses accompanied by a flash. OnePlus already confirmed that its popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-to-ditch-alert-slider-in-favor-of-new-button">Alert Slider</a> is going away in favor of a new customizable button, and the OnePlus 13T could be the first one to incorporate it.</p><p>Lastly, the launch is just around the corner, as OnePlus is launching the handset in China on April 24.</p>

<p><em><strong>Lev asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Jerry I appreciate the ways to save money that you share and I have a question. I need a phone and was thinking about buying used. Is there anything special i should know or need to look out for?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>Heyo Lev! It's great to hear from someone else who likes to be a little frugal; that can be tough if you're a tech enthusiast.</p><p>This is an awesome question because yes, there are a few extra steps you should take if you're buying a used phone, especially if you're buying it through a private sale via online classifieds or eBay. Getting a great piece of equipment at a good price is important, but knowing how to keep from getting ripped off is even more important.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-places-buy-refurbished-phone">Buying a used phone</a> gives you access to high-end devices and features without paying the early adopter tax. It's also more eco-friendly, if that's your thing, and it avoids the instant depreciation a phone experiences once it's sold. Phones are a lot like cars and are worth significantly less as soon as you've bought one.</p><p>Sadly, people are people, and there are folks out there trying to move their junk to you and your money to them. Here are a few things you can do to prevent it.</p>
<h2 id="do-these-things-first-2">Do these things first</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.75%;"><img id="Cfgow9hz7KYu2AWCxj7DZ8" name="ebay-san-jose-hq.jpg" alt="eBay San Jose HQ" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Cfgow9hz7KYu2AWCxj7DZ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="558" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Source: eBay)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Look at a reputable seller first</strong>. There's a very good chance that a place like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.backmarket.com/en-us" target="_blank">Back Market</a> will have the phone you want. You also might be able to buy it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-certified-re-newed">recertified</a> from the manufacturer or on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=17871142011" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. It may cost a little more, but buying from a place you can 100% trust can be worth a few dollars.</p><p><strong>Understand any return policy</strong>. A private party sale probably won't have any sort of return policy, but other ways to shop might. Make sure you know what that policy is and how it works before any money changes hands.</p><p><strong>Ask questions</strong>. Make sure the photos you see are of the actual device for sale. Ask if there has been any exposure to liquid or third-party repairs. Anything you can think of, just ask. You might feel like a pest, but if a seller wants your money, they can put up with a few questions.</p><p><strong>Check the </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-find-imei-number-your-phone"><strong>IMEI/ESN</strong></a>. <em>Especially</em> for any private sales. You can use these numbers to make sure the phone isn't blacklisted due to non-payment, reported lost, or even worse, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">stolen device</a>. Call your carrier with the number, and they will run a check for you before you buy anything.</p><p><strong>Ask for a photo showing the phone being charged</strong>. Ideally, make sure today's date is shown, too. This lets you know the port isn't broken or the battery hasn't gone squirrelly.</p>
<p>Don't feel like any of this is you asking too much. You're about to spend a good bit on money and there are some answers you need to make sure this is the right phone to buy. Anyone selling a phone should understand.</p>
<h2 id="other-things-to-keep-in-mind-2">Other things to keep in mind</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7u6Y4S28aV7Je6tehARRRk" name="Google-Pixel-9a-battery-chart" alt="A battery usage chart on the Google Pixel 9a, showing the progression of battery life across a few days." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7u6Y4S28aV7Je6tehARRRk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Saving money is sweet, but there are a few downsides to buying a used phone. Some are obvious, like it will have a shorter update and customer care period because it's already a bit older. Others aren't as obvious.</p><p>There is already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">wear on the battery</a>. I always talk about the battery in a phone, and that's because it's what goes bad first. Unless you damage something, the reason you stop using an old phone will be the battery. The battery starts to degrade the first time the phone is powered on and cannot be improved. This matters because the person who had it before you might have used the dickens out of it, and there could be more wear and tear on the battery than you realize.</p><p>Be prepared for some cosmetic imperfections. The glass will be covered with tiny scratches you can't see, but there may be some you can. Don't buy a phone with obvious mechanical damage, but know that even one that looks perfect probably isn't.</p><p>With these two things in mind, I suggest you <em><strong>never</strong></em> buy a used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable</a>. It's damn near impossible to change the battery, meaning only the company who made it can do it and they love to charge out of warranty prices whenever they can. Wear and tear also means something different for foldables because those tiny scratches on the glass cause stress that leads to breaks and fractures near the hinge.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VUPtiQZW2BKhoTBaMEUdWQ" name="samsung-motorola-razr-plus-2023-lifestyle-1.jpg" alt="Green line of death on the Motorola Razr Plus 2023" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VUPtiQZW2BKhoTBaMEUdWQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Companies making foldables are working on making things better, but today I would suggest you only buy your foldables new — <strong>with a warranty</strong> — from the manufacturer or your phone carrier.</p><p>None of this should scare you away from buying a used phone, because the positives outweigh the negatives. Spending half as much to get what was touted as the very pinnacle of tech just last year sounds like a good idea to me!</p>

<p>Google is responding to the U.S. federal court's ruling from<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ad-tech-space-monopoly-antitrust-us-judge-violation"> last week </a>(April 17), which stated that Alphabet, Google's parent company, violates antitrust laws in the ad-tech space. It states that this ruling will not only affect Google as a company, but would "hurt America’s consumers, economy, and technological leadership."</p><p>Leonie Brinkema, a U.S. district judge, issued a ruling stating that Google's parent company had illegally monopolized the online advertising space. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/google-partially-loses-us-advertising-tech-antitrust-case" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> brought the ruling to light, noting that this violation pertains to "advertising exchanges and tools used by websites to sell ad space." The judge also states that Google isn't allowing other companies to enter the ad space, let alone compete with them.</p><p>By stating that, the company "willfully engaged in a series of anticompetitive acts to acquire and maintain monopoly power in the publisher ad server and ad exchange markets."</p>

<p>Google outlines several points in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/doj-search-remedies-apr-2025/">Keyword blog</a> regarding how this judgment would negatively impact the company as it competes with AI technologies like ChatGPT, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek" target="_blank">DeepSeek</a>, and others.</p><p>To start, Google states that this judgment would force phones and browsers to use alternative search engines, such as Bing and Yahoo!, making it more difficult for users to access Google Search, despite it being their primary option.</p><p>Secondly, the government aims to prevent Google from paying phones or browsers, such as Mozilla, to maintain Search as the default search engine. Google claims that this move will exacerbate the situation for users, as companies may start charging customers to compensate for the revenue loss resulting from Google's actions.</p><p>Additionally, Google states that the Department of Justice (DOJ)'s proposal will also require them to share user information with unknown companies, which could, in turn, jeopardize users' privacy and safety. The DOJ has also asked Google to separate Chrome from Android and wants the company to sell Chrome. It also suggested splitting Android from Google Search and Play without forcing a sell-off.</p>

As of now, Google says it disagrees with the decision and will appeal to the court to look for ways to mitigate this judgment.</p><p>The new trial for Google to prove that it isn't in violation of these antitrust laws begins today (Apr. 21).

<hr>
<p>Google is busy rolling out its latest Android Auto update; however, previous glimpses of an intriguing new feature have reportedly vanished.</p><p>The update was spotted rolling out earlier today (Apr. 21) by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/21/android-auto-14-2-rolling-out-glasses-removal/">9to5Google</a> for Android Auto drivers as version 14.2. The patch doesn't appear to be substantial, nor does it feature any noteworthy features for drivers to enjoy. The publication states v14.2 only offers "bug fixes and other minor tweaks," so it seems Google is keeping things lighthearted in mid-April.</p><p>However, what is noteworthy is the supposed removal of a previously discovered (and once assumed) feature in development.</p><p>The post says Google has removed all mentions of "Glasses" within Android Auto's code as v14.2 rolls out. It conducted another teardown of its APK, which discovered a lack of its previous barebones code. Speculation says there may have been a few "alternate translation" issues with the code that could've forced the idea of "Glasses" in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-auto-review">Android Auto</a>.</p><p>With things still woefully unclear, it'll be worth playing things by ear and seeing if this feature surfaces again in the future.</p>

<p>If you missed it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-smart-glasses-integration-code-rumors">there were rumors</a> that Google was developing a smart glasses-based feature for Android Auto. Leveraged from the Hindi version of the app, a tipster found two strings that mention "Glasses" and the ability to "start navigation to launch Glasses." However, the way the strings are mentioned, as highlighted by 9to5, could point toward that "alternate translation" issue.</p><p>Its post states the English version didn't match with what was found in the overseas version. So, while it doesn't seem like Google is working on smart glasses integration, maybe there's a future where this changes.</p><p>Nothing else was found in that teardown earlier this month. What we were able to chew on was Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">TED 2025 demo</a>, which was all about its Android XR ambitions. At its core, the demo featured the company's "memory" feature for smart glasses. With them on, the glasses were recording and making mental notes about the placements of items. This is for the betterment of its rediscovery capabilities.</p><p>If you lost something, users could ask Gemini where it is, like "Where did I leave my hotel room key?" In the demo, the AI was able to inform the user where their key card is through descriptors and items around it to help them.</p>

Google's smartwatches also use many of the same sensors as are included across the Fitbit line, largely due to its acquisition of the company in 2021.</p>

It's also our choice for the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit#section-best-fitbit-tracker">best Fitbit tracker</a> on the market today, in part due to its small, comfortable build and its inclusion of a haptic button, unlike the Charge 5. </p><p>The discount is only available on the Gold/Coral version of the watch.</p><p><strong>Price comparison: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/fitbit-charge-6-advanced-fitness-health-tracker-obsidian/6559662.p?skuId=6559662" target="_blank">Best Buy - $159.95</a> | <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Fitbit-Charge-6-Fitness-Tracker-with-Heart-Rate-GPS-Premium-Membership-Health-Tools-Obsidian-Black/5087333627" target="_blank">Walmart - $138.95</a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC644KMJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="180890c2-ca07-40b3-a8bf-d1868d92796d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Fitbit Charge 6:" data-dimension48="Fitbit Charge 6:" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you like a small watch rather than something bulky; you want a watch witch a haptic button for navigation; you'd prefer something that can sync up with your workout equipment.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for something with an altimeter or gyroscope; you want something with dual-band GPS and have the budget to upgrade.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review">Fitbit Charge 6</a> is the best fitness tracker out there, especially if you're the type of person who wants something small and doesn't mind a limited display. With a wide range of sleep and health monitoring sensors, GPS, a physical, haptic navigation button, and support for a handful of Google apps, the Charge 6 has virtually everything someone would want in a fitness tracker. Plus, it offers a roughly seven-day battery life, which is more than enough for most users.</p><p>The Charge 6's small build also makes it a little easier to wear while sleeping than some of the bulkier GPS smartwatches available today, in case you want to take advantage of sleep tracking.</p><p>Additionally, it features Bluetooth and can connect with treadmills and other gym equipment, making it super easy to track workouts.</p><p>However, if you're set on needing certain things such as an altimeter or gyroscope, or you'd simply prefer to one of Google's larger Pixel Watches, there are a handful of other options out there worth taking a look at.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has rolled out Android 16 Beta 4 to all supported Pixels, and it's the last beta before the big launch next month, loaded with fixes, polish, and broader device support.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/04/the-fourth-beta-of-android-16.html" target="_blank">latest update</a> drop didn’t really spill much about what’s new under the hood. And since we’re this close to the stable release—likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">lining up with Google I/O in May</a>—it’s safe to say we’re not expecting any big surprises. This build is probably just about tightening screws, squashing bugs, and making sure everything runs smooth for launch day.</p><p>Beta 4 packs the April 2025 security patch, locking down two stealthy bugs and a bunch of other critical CVEs. Google has also dropped the factory images for those who like the manual route, and the OTA rollout is already underway (look for build BP22.250325.007).</p>
<h2 id="bug-hunt-wins-2">Bug hunt wins</h2>
<p>Android 16 Beta 4’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/release-notes#beta4" target="_blank">official notes</a> reveal fixes for some pretty key bugs, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-to-bring-a-dynamic-battery-indicator">weird battery drain</a>, glitchy haptics, and radar not working in the Pixel Weather app. It also squashes system stability issues and random launcher crashes some folks were dealing with.</p><p>Additionally, a few Pixel users have taken to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/android_beta/comments/1k1phxe/android_16_beta_4/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> to report that the "Screen-off Fingerprint Unlock" option has gone missing after installing the latest Android 16 beta (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-16-beta-4-quietly-removes-small-useful-pixel-feature/" target="_blank">Android Police</a>).</p>

<p>If you’ve got a Pixel, from the 6 series all the way up to the new 9 lineup (including Fold, Tablet, and A models), you’re good to go with the Android 16 Beta 4 update.</p><p>A big highlight in this release is the first-ever beta build for the freshly launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, which is now part of the Android Beta Program’s device lineup.</p><p>Google is sticking to its Q2 2025 launch plan and letting beta testers know they’ll get automatic OTA update notifications once it’s ready to roll.</p>
<h2 id="beta-goes-global-2">Beta goes global</h2>
<p>Following in the footsteps of OnePlus and Xiaomi, Google is opening up the Android 16 beta to even more brands. Now, iQoo, Lenovo, Oppo, Realme, Sharp, Vivo, and Honor devices are also getting in on the pre-release action.</p><p>To check if Android 16 Beta 4 is ready for your Pixel, head to Settings > System > Software updates, then tap "System update." From there, hit "Check for updates" to see if it's available.</p>

<ul><li>With Hybring Reasoning, developers can enable or disable the 'thinking' process, maintaining speed while improving accuracy.</li><li>The new Gemini model claims to be faster and more cost-effective than previous versions.</li><li>Gemini 2.5 Flash also outperforms competing AI models in benchmark tests across various tasks.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Late last week, Google shared that it is releasing the Gemini 2.5 Flash — a new version of the Gemini AI model. It highlights the hybrid reasoning capability, which further allows developers to control the level of reasoning applied to a given prompt.</p><p>In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/start-building-with-gemini-25-flash/">announcement post</a>, Google notes that developers can now start building with the new Gemini 2.5 Flash model, which is also a faster and cheaper model. It is released in preview through the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-2" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6wCFEbJMF2oZgz3qNPozX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1407" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition to being cost-effective, the new model is also a low-latency thinking model that is reasonably priced, particularly considering its solid benchmarks. This is because the new model is based on the popular foundation of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0</a> Flash.</p><p>As mentioned, it is a hybrid model, which allows developers to turn on thinking or disable it. Despite disabling it, the company promises that it can still maintain the fast speeds of 2.0 Flash and simultaneously improve performance.</p><p>As for the thinking model, the Gemini 2.5 models are capable of reasoning before responding. This means it doesn’t immediately generate an output; “the model can perform a ‘thinking’ process to better understand the prompt, break down complex tasks, and plan a response.” The complex tasks here can include solving math problems or analyzing research questions. The thinking process claims to allow the model to give more accurate and comprehensive answers.</p>

<p>Google has also shared the Gemini 2.5 Flash model’s benchmark tests in comparison with some of the competition, which includes tasks based on mathematics, science, code generation, code editing, and visual reasoning — and does outperform the rival AI models.</p><p>Other than the developers taking advantage of the new Gemini 2.5 Flash, regular consumers can also try it out in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini app</a>, alongside Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking and Gemini 2.0 Pro Experimental models, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">were unveiled</a> in February this year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Having an external SSD is highly convenient when traveling, and as I started going back to events in 2025, I collated all the drives I have to see which would be best. There's been a steady rise in stick SSD drives in recent years; I used SK Hynix's Tube T31 last year, and it was pretty great — while it looks identical a regular USB drive, it houses an SSD inside, and is able to deliver 1000MB/s transfers. <br><br>But the drive I ended up using the most over the course of 2025 is TeamGroup's X1 Max. TeamGroup debuted the drive in Q2 2024, and the SSD is now available globally. The base 256GB model costs $28 on Amazon, and the 512GB variant is $53 as of writing. The model I tested is the 1TB version, and that's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/TEAMGROUP-Interface-Compatible-Smartphone-TX1MAX3256GB01/dp/B0D3HBPJWT">available for $73 on Amazon</a>. By contrast, Samsung's T7 Portable — the best-selling external SSD by some margin — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Portable-SSD-1TB-MU-PC1T0T/dp/B0874XN4D8">costs $99</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ou3ysqmGgSnddc2USrUVme" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ou3ysqmGgSnddc2USrUVme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The distinctive design feature of the X1 Max is that it looks like a regular flash drive. SK Hynix's Tube T31 is noticeably bigger and bulkier than the X1 Max, and there's just no way to tell by looking at the X1 Max that you're getting a 1TB SSD; TeamGroup deserves a lot of credit for the sleek design of the SSD.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="EJLdrZZGaTc3W3fiDkzRne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EJLdrZZGaTc3W3fiDkzRne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another thing the brand nailed is the connectivity; the X1 Max has the standard USB-A connector at one end, but you also get a USB-C port on the other side, giving it much better versatility. This was an annoyance on the Tube T31, but there are no problems in this regard with the X1 Max; in the four months I had the drive, I used it with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a>, and an assortment of Windows devices including my gaming rig.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="5CTYmc5JBvyUYckeSgLake" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5CTYmc5JBvyUYckeSgLake.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In all that time, I didn't have any issues whatsoever with the drive, and it's this versatility that makes the X1 Max stand out, and why I use it as my to-go external drive while traveling. It's significantly smaller than other external SSDs, and the fact that you can just plug it in to any device without having to use a cable makes it highly convenient.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sgy3DeBT8zAyrSvz5x9Tme" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sgy3DeBT8zAyrSvz5x9Tme.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Measuring 6.3cm and coming in at just 12g, the X1 Max is small and light enough that you can take anywhere, and portability is not an issue. If anything, I had to leave it in a side pocket on my bag so it wouldn't get lost. The shell itself is made out of aluminum, and the connectors on either end get a plastic cap to protect against dust.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="vCrSKNnGt6WAngKqByyNoe" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vCrSKNnGt6WAngKqByyNoe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The drive gets up to 1000MB/s when reading data, and it is able to hit 900MB/s during writes. I had no problems moving hundreds of gigabytes of photos and videos from phones, documents and other vital data from my Windows devices, and assorted multimedia to and from phones and tablets.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Ux9hvQpCfyWxvpxMd24Qne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ux9hvQpCfyWxvpxMd24Qne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The only quibble is that the drive gets hot during extended transfer sessions; this is often the case with most external SSDs, and while TeamGroup says the X1 Max uses an aluminum alloy cooling solution to deliver better thermals, it's still quite hot. The write cache is quite limited, so if you're transferring over 40GB of data at once, you will see a decline in the bandwidth. This isn't an issue most of the time, but it was slightly slower than other stick SSDs I tested when transferring videos out of my phone.</p>
<p>There's no bundled software either, and you miss out on password protection, so if you need to safeguard sensitive data, you'll need to use a custom solution. The X1 Max uses the USB 3.2 Gen2 x1 standard, and I didn't see any problems getting the drive to connect to just about any platform. Honestly, it's for this reason that I used the X1 Max so much in 2025, and having traveled to four countries and using the drive extensively, it still looks pristine — I have no doubt that this thing is built to last.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fGsftAiqVEppYuTevt3yne" name="TeamGroup X1 Max" alt="TeamGroup X1 Max external SSD" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fGsftAiqVEppYuTevt3yne.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Ultimately, that's why I like the X1 Max over similar options that are starting to become available. It's light enough that you don't even notice it, has both USB-C and USB-A connectors, and does a reliable job connecting to phones, tablets, Windows, macOS devices, handheld consoles like the Steam Deck, and just about anything else. It's also a solid value if you're interested in getting the 1TB variant, and</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Vivo has proven over the last 15 months that it knows how to deliver terrific camera phones, and having used the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review"> X200 Pro</a> over the course of 2025, I'm very interested in seeing what the X200 Ultra has to deliver. To give you some context, last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">X100 Ultra</a> is still one of the best camera phones around, and the combination of a 1-inch lens along with exquisite tuning continue to give the device a distinct edge. <br><br>Thankfully, there's no need to wait any longer, as Vivo has just unveiled the X200 Ultra in China. What's of particular interest is that the device has two imaging chips — the VS1  and V3+ — with the VS1 handling "preliminary optimization of raw data" to optimize image quality and the V3+ doing the usual "postprocessing tasks".</p>

<p>Video is getting a boost as well, with Vivo introducing what it calls Multi-Focal Portrait Video Master. The X200 Ultra is slated to deliver movie-like videos, and the device handles 4K60 10bit Log along with 4K120 footage. Interestingly, Vivo is debuting a Photographer Kit accessor this time that includes a ZEISS 2.35x Telephoto Converter, camera grip, and bundled case. <br><br>Xiaomi has a habit of doing the same with its phones, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> has a gorgeous red kit that's great to use. But with Vivo including an external lens with its package, I'm keen on seeing what it has to offer. I'll be getting my hands on the X200 Ultra and the external lens, and will share my findings in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Continuing with the camera, the X200 Ultra doesn't have a 1-inch main camera any longer, but it has a 50MP 1/1.28-inch Sony LYT818 sensor, and it should be just as good as the X200 Pro. It retains the 200MP HP9 module that goes up to 3.7x, and you get a 50MP wide-angle that also uses the Sony LYT818 sensor. <br><br>Switching over to the hardware, Vivo is using Qualcomm silicon once again, and like the best phones of 2025, you get the Snapdragon 8 Elite. The device has 16GB of RAM as standard, and comes with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB storage models. It has a 6.82-inch panel with QHD resolution, 2160Hz PWM dimming, and a 6000mAh battery with 90W charging tech. <br><br>Similar to last year, the X200 Ultra isn't going to debut outside China, and that's annoying when you consider the caliber of the cameras. Still, the X200 Pro is a decent enough alternative if you need something similar, and having switched back to the device, it is easily among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones of the year</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>After rolling out Gemini Live’s real-time video and screen sharing support to Gemini Advanced subscribers late last month, Google is now expanding it to all Android users.</p><p>Google first showcased these Project Astra-based features at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-mwc-2025">MWC Barcelona</a> this year, with the rollout starting by the end of March. It was officially introduced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> devices, and followed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-rolling-out-video-and-screen-sharing-support-for-gemini-live">Gemini Advanced users</a>. Now, it is available for regular users without the Advanced subscription that Gemini offers (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/16/gemini-live-camera-free/">9to5Google</a>).</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">📣 It’s here: ask Gemini about anything you see. Share your screen or camera in Gemini Live to brainstorm, troubleshoot, and more.Rolling out to Pixel 9 and Samsung Galaxy S25 devices today and available for all Advanced users on @Android in the Gemini app:… pic.twitter.com/fjTD4qhvjz<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1909215393186472380">April 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The feature that lets users talk live to Gemini about anything they see either on their phone’s screen or device’s camera, and is pretty easy to launch. Users have to trigger Gemini as they normally do, and when the “Ask Gemini” window pops up, there will be a new clickable short window dubbed “Share screen with Live” right above it. Hitting this will allow Gemini to look at the screen while users still talk to it.</p>

<p>Users can showcase their device’s camera or scroll through any app while talking to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini Live</a>, which responds to their queries based on what they are seeing on the screen. Similar to live screen recording notifications in the notification pane, there’s a Gemini Live screen sharing too, through which users can stop sharing their screen per their requirements.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’ve been hearing great feedback on Gemini Live with camera and screen share, so we decided to bring it to more people ✨Starting today and over the coming weeks, we're rolling it out to *all* @Android users with the Gemini app. Enjoy!PS If you don’t have the app yet,… https://t.co/dTsxLZLxNI<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1912591827087315323">April 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Additionally, it lets users organize their spaces, brainstorm creative projects, troubleshoot and get input, get personal shopping advice, and develop their skills and get feedback, notes Google in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-live-android-tips/">announcement post</a> from last month.</p><p>It is encouraging to see Google not putting its advanced features behind a paywall and making it free for all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> users. And for users who are concerned about their audio, video, and screen shares to Gemini and being stored, they can set up auto-delete functionality via Gemini Apps Activity through their Google account settings.</p>

<p>This week, I wore augmented reality glasses that showed my pace, heart rate, power, and other stats in the corner of my vision while running, the data ported over from my Garmin Fenix 8. While I don't think the hardware is quite there yet, it's enough to excite me about the future possibilities.</p><p>I need more time to review my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://engoeyewear.com/products/engo-2-photochromic">ENGO 2 AR glasses</a> properly, but the concept fascinated me when ENGO pitched their running HUD to me. Would seeing real-time stats with just a glance inspire or distract me?</p><p>The design is best suited to cyclists who need to keep their eyes on the road and off their watch or bike computer. However, there's a reason why so many runners rely on audio prompts to display their stats, without having to break stride and look down at their wrists.</p><p>So, I wore these smart glasses on some hilly runs and hikes, using stats like elevation gain and average ascent speed to motivate myself to keep pushing, plus my average heart rate to see if my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load focus</a> would fall into low/high aerobic or anaerobic zones.</p><p>My main takeaways? Like most AR glasses, this running HUD's design and visibility require some improvement, as does the software. However, when we start to see glasses with lighter frames and wider field of view (FoV), fitness-focused <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses" target="_blank">smart glasses</a> could become a real use case.</p>
<h2 id="running-ar-glasses-have-to-find-the-right-balance-2">Running AR glasses have to find the right balance</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ENGO knew that runners and cyclists wouldn't put up with heavy AR glasses. The ENGO 2 only weighs 36–41g, depending on the size, or a little over an ounce. That's lighter than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Meta Ray-Bans</a> (about 50g) without any holographic tech, and well below AR glasses like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> (90g) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> (87g).</p><p>It also has an all-day battery. It's rated for 12 hours, and while I haven't worn them that long, the percentage barely dipped after an hour of use. Compared to battery-guzzling AR glasses tethered to a phone or battery, that's pretty great.</p><p>Then again, these ENGO 2 glasses don't have traditional smart glasses features like cameras, speakers, or an AI assistant. They're highly specialized and rely on data from another device to work. In other words, they're only that efficient because of their simplicity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-on-face" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses worn on the author's face in a selfie photo; the angle shows how thick the HUD portion of the glasses is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UpSL26Qj6wXE7z6nDDxTKE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My first real issue with the ENGO 2 is that its weight is centered on the bridge and nose pads, where the battery and HUD are located. The guts of the device block my center FoV and make the frames slide down my nose every few strides.</p><p>My second issue is that ENGO was so conscientious about keeping athletes' vision unblocked that the monocular holographic portion is small, blurry (to my near-sighted eyes), and becomes cut off whenever the glasses slide down my nose. I can read everything, but I have to take my eyes and attention off the trail to do so.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1274px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="WbKbvk8oD9gcgYhU4EwDEQ" name="Engo-2-render-holographic-display" alt="Render of the ENGO 2 smart glasses, showing what the running stats look like on the HUD." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WbKbvk8oD9gcgYhU4EwDEQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1274" height="717" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can see what the running stats look like in this press image; it's too small for me to easily photograph. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: ENGO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Plus, ENGO 2 glasses rely on a finicky motion control sensor to swipe between data fields. I'd find myself waving my hand in front of my face several times before it registered the switch, and since there's no "back" option, you must wave through your entire dashboard to return to the first set of stats. It's better than awkward button controls, but still more distracting than I'd like.</p><p>ENGO sent me the photochromic glasses that adjust to the current light. They're easier to wear in any conditions than the static sunglasses, but also a bit goofier looking without that reflective layer, so I might feel a bit self-conscious wearing them at a race.</p><p>Again, this isn't a review. I'm mainly using the ENGO 2 as an example of how challenging it is to get AR glasses right.</p>

<p>The moment I reviewed Meta's Ray-Bans, I saw their fitness potential. So it doesn't surprise me that Meta sees it too: its next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">Oakley smart glasses</a> will supposedly target athletes. It even added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-aria-gen-2-smart-glasses-look-like-serious-upgrade-on-ray-ban-meta">HR tracking to its research AR glasses</a>, though I wonder how accurate it is compared to a smartwatch or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-hrm-200-helped-me-realize-i-was-too-harsh-on-hrm-chest-straps">chest strap</a>.</p><p>Just like the ENGO 2, Meta Ray-Bans tend to slide down my nose while running, and the weight takes getting used to. However, the built-in speakers fulfill the same open-ear headphone niche as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/shokz-openfit-2-review" target="_blank">Shokz OpenFit 2s</a>, and the camera allows you to capture <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again" target="_blank">candid,</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/these-smart-glasses-have-given-me-a-new-reason-to-record-video-again"> first-person photos</a> or videos of your races or activities.</p><p>Since smart glasses are essentially portable Bluetooth speakers, they can already read audio prompts from a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> for lap or mile data, or when you leave your target zone. However, that's not as dynamic as AR glasses, which continuously display this data.</p><p>What if someone — Meta, Google, Samsung, or someone else — can pull off the whole package? Could we see AR glasses with audio and AI capabilities packaged with holographic tech and HR tracking? Ideally, with a wider FoV that makes data more naturally readable without obstructing your vision?</p>

<p>Meta's upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Hypernova AR glasses</a> will feature a monocular display in the bottom-right lens area, along with an upgraded camera and an sEMG band that detects finger gestures for controls. Imagine if you could tap your fingers together mid-stride to pull up your HR data in your vision, then tap them again to clear the display?</p><p>Meanwhile, Google and Samsung are developing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">Project Haean smart glasses</a> with holographic capabilities that only weigh 50g or so. There's no guarantee that these glasses will support fitness use cases, but it's reasonable to expect that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr" target="_blank">Android XR</a> might offer turn-by-turn navigation for GPX routes or display your Fitbit or Samsung Health data for workouts.</p><p>Yes, these are just hypotheticals. However, I honestly believe that smart glasses brands will follow ENGO's lead and treat fitness as a major use case, once they're petite and long-lasting enough to appeal to users outside the hardcore tech sphere.</p><p>Now's the time to ask yourself: Do you want a HUD to display your health data, so you're always aware of whether you're sticking to your target pace or falling short? Or do you think your current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or bike computer is enough?</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The open-ear market has expanded in the last couple of years. Competition has been heating up, but despite that, quality open-ear earbuds generally cost around $150. That can go even higher, as I discovered when I reviewed the Bose Ultra Open earbuds.</p><p>The Soundcore AeroFit 2 hits the market at a great time by offering a robust open-ear product with a customizable fit that punches above its price point, competing with some products costing much more. Let’s get into it!</p>

<p>The Soundcore AeroFit 2 is available now on Soundcore.com and Amazon.com for $99.99. Both sites are having a sale as I write this, bringing the price down to $79.99. You can pick up a pair in one of four colors: midnight, White, Minty Green, or Midnight Blue.</p><p>If you’re reading this and don’t see that sale price currently, know that the previous AeroFit earbuds were on sale six times in twelve months, so you should be able to pick up the AeroFit 2 at the lower price if you’re willing to wait.</p>

<p>With Soundcore, you can always count on a variety of customization options in their app, but this time around, they took it one step further and gave you some customization options in the earbuds themselves.</p><p>We’ll return to that customization in a moment, but first, let’s examine the hardware. I like the way that Soundcore sets up the status lights on its cases, and the AeroFit 2 follows a similar design language. The front of the large case has a broad LED light that pulses to let you know the charging status, among other things. You get minimal Soundcore branding on the top of the case, a USB-C port on the rear, next to the pairing button.</p><p>I have the Minty Green AeroFit 2, and it is a gorgeous color! Opening the case, you’re greeted by the jellybeans and Hot Tamales. Despite being a Type 2 diabetic, it’s candy that the AeroFit 2’s design reminds me of. Yes, the battery housings that sit behind your ears look like Hot Tamales candy, while the portions that house the speakers look like large jellybeans.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The AeroFit 2 come in a few different colors, but I love the Minty Green hue!</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>With these open-ear earbuds, you get hooks that loop around your ears, with a piece that holds the battery that sits behind your ears and counterbalances the speaker units that sit over, not inside, your ear canals. The portion that houses the speakers is touch sensitive, and that’s how you control all of the functions.</p><p>The muscle memory acquisition is pretty quick, but they do require you to touch a specific spot on the earbuds to activate controls. Once you have that down pat, controlling playback and call functions is simple and works reliably.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="aULGLvrSSzDbeTUtpQ6sBS" name="anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-4-position-adjustability.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 earbud's adjustable ear hook displayed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aULGLvrSSzDbeTUtpQ6sBS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hook is comfortable and doesn’t feel heavy. It has some soft-touch material to it, but what makes it stand out from other options on the market is the 4-position, adjustable speaker module. Once you slip the earbuds on, that module can be repositioned with a satisfying click. Adjust it in one direction, and it feels like it sits tighter to the ear; with an adjustment in the opposite direction, loosening the fit a bit.</p><p>Soundcore says that you’re supposed to adjust the kidney bean-shaped earpieces so they sit right over your ear canal, which is what I did. They were very comfortable and felt secure during runs, and lying on my back during bench presses.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BfxvuANccq3viTDnxbS5QZ" name="anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-4-position-adjustment.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 in the hands of the reviewer, showing off adjustable hook" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BfxvuANccq3viTDnxbS5QZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Wearing the AeroFit 2 for extended periods, 4+ hours, I didn’t experience any ear fatigue or hot spots. You won’t necessarily forget you’re wearing them, but you certainly won’t get antsy to get them off your ears. The metallic colors will stand out as you wear them, and they have a bit of a reflective quality to them that may help some runners at night.</p><p>The good news about extended wear is that the battery will hold up, as long as LDAC is not activated. With the volume around 60%, I got roughly nine hours of playback, but in real-world usage, expect to charge once every couple of weeks if your use is primarily for fitness.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="qf6Wsv2N5YUErGQ3WktkTZ" name="anker-soundcore-aerofit-2-close-up-pairing-button-usb-c.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore AeroFit 2 showing the back of the case charging options and pairing button" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qf6Wsv2N5YUErGQ3WktkTZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>A ten-minute quick charge will get you up to four hours of playback. Recharging via the case will get you a total of 42 hours use with LDAC off. The case itself is easy to manage, with regard to battery, as it supports both Qi wireless and USB-C charging.</p>

<p>One of the areas in which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds" target="_blank">open-ear products have improved most over the last couple of years</a> is the ability to deliver better bass response. My current favorites, in terms of bass and overall sound quality, are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-ultra-open-earbuds-review" target="_blank">Bose Ultra Open</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/nothing-ear-open-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear (Open)</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/beyerdynamic-verio200-review" target="_blank">Beyerdynamic Verio 200</a>. So, naturally, when I took the time to test how sonics are reproduced, I did some A/B testing with those competitors.</p><p>First, let’s get acquainted with how the AeroFit 2 stands on its own when it comes to sound quality. The power output was the first thing I noticed when connected to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>. Volume was very comfortable at only 60% of the max—an experience I don’t often have with Bluetooth earbuds. The earbuds perform solidly in a quiet space without competing with ambient sound.</p><p>Listening to "Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes" by Paul Simon and "Down By The River To Pray" from the "O’ Brother Where Art Thou" OST, the soundstage is robust for open-ear earbuds. Simon’s vocals can sound a bit sibilant, depending on the headphones or earbuds I’m testing. That was my experience with that track and the AeroFit 2s. It wasn’t grating or harsh but right on the edge of sibilance.</p><p>Conversely, the horns on Art Blakey’s “Moanin” can be quite harsh and grating, but the AeroFit 2’s didn’t reproduce them that way, making the track a delight to listen to.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>In a quiet space, these open earbuds perform solidly with plenty of power output and a robust soundstage.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>When it comes to detail and nuance, you get LDAC support, and with that, you get a respectable level of detail and nuance. You just need to be aware of the fact that activating it will drain your battery much faster.</p><p>Revisiting “Moanin’” but this time with Charles Mingus at the helm, the stereo image separation and instrumentation are quite enjoyable, although the highs lack a bit of sparkle. The track sounds great, but that feeling of almost being there is somewhat lacking in the earbuds’ reproduction of this brilliantly recorded and mastered energetic Jazz romp.</p>

<p>The good news is that if there’s anything you don’t like about the AeroFit 2's sound quality, Anker Soundcore gives you decent EQ options in their well-appointed app. I found the Jazz EQ preset to work best for me, but you can also customize your sound preference by utilizing their eight-band customizable EQ to create your own presets.</p><p>Across the board, listening to music and movies proved to be an enjoyable experience with the AeroFit 2. The app gives you options like their spatial audio #D Surround Sound setting and low-latency gaming mode to help you, along with video and gaming content.</p><p>The most important aspect of an open-ear design is its ability to pump quality sound to your brain while allowing ambient sound in. The AeroFit 2 performed well here. Playing at volumes low enough that they don’t trigger (~76dB) volume warnings, the bass still had sufficient presence, and the overall sound quality was enjoyable. You will deal with issues of auditory masking, that is, when sounds that aren’t your music have similar but louder sounds than your music and overpower it. There is no way around that with open-ear designs.</p><p>A quick note: The Anker Soundcore team added new translation functionality to the earbuds as I was going to publish. After I've had some time to test that, I'll update this article with my findings.</p>

<p>At $100, there isn’t much to dislike about Soundcore's accomplishments here. The sound quality is solid, but it isn’t without some caveats, mostly due to the form factor rather than any shortcomings with Soundcore’s engineering choices.</p><p>My primary concern is that the AeroFit 2 can sometimes feel a bit too dark. The lack of sparkle in higher frequencies never makes things feel muddy; there’s just a lack of brightness in vocals and instrumentation.</p><p>On tracks, games, or movies with heavy bass, you will feel the speaker module vibrating energetically against your ear. You have to have turned the volume up quite a bit and be playing something with enough bass, but the vibrations can be a bit annoying. Thankfully, at regular volumes, this wasn’t an issue.</p><p>Commonly seen in Bluetooth TWS earbuds with multipoint, if you activate LDAC or the new translation feature, you will deactivate the multipoint functionality.</p>

<p>After some A/B testing between these, Bose, and Nothing earbuds, I found the AeroFit 2 in the middle regarding sound quality. I prefer the more robust EQ options, bass response, and sparkle of the Nothing Ear Open, but you’ll pay $50 for the difference, even more of a cost difference when the AeroFit 2 goes on sale.</p><p>From my testing, I didn’t find a night-and-day difference in sound quality or features between Bose and the AeroFit 2, so I can’t recommend them over the AeroFit 2 unless it’s a matter of form factor. Bose has more clarity, but the more compelling difference is that of a product having a speaker that sits over your ear versus one that sits on your earlobe, thus leaving the ear canal completely unobstructed.</p><p>For most people comparing the Nothing Ear Open and the Soundcore AeroFit 2, the latter will be the better choice based on sale pricing, battery life, slightly better water resistance, and wireless charging capability. Overall, though, I prefer the sound quality of the Nothing Ear Open, but the difference doesn't carry enough weight for me to wholeheartedly recommend spending the additional money for it unless you comfortably have it to spend.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-soundcore-aerofit-2-should-you-buy-them"><span>Soundcore AeroFit 2: Should you buy them?</span></h2>
<p><strong>You should buy the Soundcore AeroFit 2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want/need open-ear audio</li><li>You want wireless charging</li><li>Cost is a deciding factor between competitors</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy the Soundcore AeroFit 2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want fuller bass response</li></ul>
<p>Anker’s Soundcore AeroFit 2 stomps with the big dawgs!! Many of the competitors in this space can cost at least 50% more without a similar increase in sound quality and feature set, so the AeroFit 2 punches above its price point.</p><p>You’ll get a great app with a lot of customization, multi-point and Hi-Res Wireless Audio support, IP55 dust and water resistance, wireless charging, and standout comfort in this package, making it easy to recommend at this price point, especially when it's on sale!</p>

I say "finally" because the iOS version of Chrome has had it for two whole years. Many people rejoiced at this change, but I'm happy for a very different reason: Google isn't <em>forcing</em> me to use something I can't stand.</p><p>That's right. If you're like me, you can simply press and hold the address bar and drag it back to the top, where it belongs. Other popular browsers, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/phones/windows-phone-fans-get-loved-feature-for-microsoft-edge-on-android-ios" target="_blank">Microsoft Edge for Android</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-move-url-bar-bottom-your-screen-samsung-internet-browser" target="_blank">Samsung Internet Browser,</a> already allow users to choose where they want the address bar, and I appreciate it when users have a choice in their UI design.</p><p>What I don't like is having buttons on the bottom of my screen. I rejoiced when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-android-navigation-gestures">gesture-based navigation</a> made its official Android debut in Android 10, giving all phones the ability to get rid of those pesky navigation buttons on the bottom of the screen. Then, app developers had to muck it up by moving all the buttons in their apps down to the bottom.</p>
<h2 id="tabs-at-the-top-please-2">Tabs at the top, please</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="quMTgsriALbV7iozU5iUtA" name="honor-magic-v3-chrome-tabs" alt="Tabs on the top of Google Chrome for Android on an Honor Magic V3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quMTgsriALbV7iozU5iUtA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As AC's Jerry Hildenbrand so eloquently put it this week when we were having the discussion about buttons on the bottom, "any phone with a screen bigger than 4 inches needs buttons on the bottom." The idea is that bottom-aligned buttons are easier to reach than ones at the top, something Steve Jobs and co. agreed with in the first iPhone release.</p><p>The problem is that this is only partially true. The original iOS release standardized navigation buttons/tabs for apps at the bottom of the screen because the original iPhone's screen was positively <em>tiny</em> by modern standards. Everything on the original iPhone's display was reachable with your thumb, including the back button on the <strong>top-left</strong> corner of the screen, something absolutely no phone can claim today.</p><p>If I try to open my phone app from the home screen with one hand, it's already literally impossible. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a> I use as my daily driver has a display that's simply too wide for my thumb to reach across to the phone icon, and that's on the <strong>bottom-left</strong> corner of the screen. No amount of finger gymnastics makes it possible to touch this icon without grabbing the phone with my other hand to stabilize it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e44J52M3smxrVFRYWXBXwC" name="hard-to-reach-bottom-buttons" alt="Modern phones are too large to be one-handable, negating the advantages of buttons on the bottom of the screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e44J52M3smxrVFRYWXBXwC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">No matter how hard I try, it's impossible to tap anything on the bottom-left corner of a modern phone. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alright, now that the phone app is open, I realize it defaults to "Recents," which is the tab in the middle. If I wanted to access the "Favorites" tab, I would once again have to stabilize the phone with my other hand and then click it. This defeats the <em>entire purpose</em> of bottom-aligned navigation buttons.</p><p>If we look back at the Android 4.0 days, I'm reminded of how much better the "tabs at the top" design was, if only for one reason: you could swipe between them. Some of my arguments against bottom-aligned navigation buttons would be negated if developers went back to letting us swipe between tabs. Head to the 4:56 timestamp in this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/_q0G9PgeBGo?si=DzmxclIFuxMcW6s2&t=296">Galaxy Nexus UI tour video</a> and you'll quickly see what I mean.</p><p>This isn't the only thing people have wanted brought back in recent years. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/your-favorite-android-phones-are-finally-getting-these-once-iphone-only-nostalgic-cases">Clicks cases</a> are bringing physical buttons back. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/best-android-multitasking-ui-ranked">best multitasking UIs</a> ditch the iOS 10-inspired Overview screen for something much more efficient and, ironically, older. I could go on with other examples, but you get the point.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TrEoqRNyGx7JEa9Wivg4nC" name="google-photos-non-swipable-tabs" alt="Tabs in apps need to be swipable, as illustrated in the Google Photos app on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrEoqRNyGx7JEa9Wivg4nC.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="480" height="270" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">We should be able to swipe between sections and tabs of an app, but that's not a common UI practice anymore. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Bottom-aligned buttons also take up unnecessary space in a more important part of the screen. We can make fun of it all we want — and we have — but Apple's decision to put The Notch™️at the top of the iPhone's display was because people's natural vision cancels out static elements at the <strong>top </strong>of a screen, not the bottom. Ask most iPhone owners, and they'll tell you they don't even notice the notch.</p><p>But rotate an iPhone and you'll suddenly see that big honkin' chunk missing from the display. It's not like we don't have plenty of screen real estate, but there's no reason I need to be looking at static buttons all the time at the bottom of an app. It's a silly use of space.</p><p>I would love to be given the choice of moving those bottom-aligned buttons back to the top, where I feel they belong. Chrome tabs are at the top. Old-school paper folder tabs are at the top. Some apps, like Google Drive, use a combination of swipable top tabs in conjunction with bottom-aligned buttons.</p><p>As usual, what I want is the freedom of choice for these UI elements. Many people love bottom-aligned tabs, buttons, and address bars, but I certainly don't, and I dislike being forced to use them.</p><p>Anyways, thank you for listening to my TED Talk. I'll see you all next week.</p>

<p>Last year's Moto G Stylus 5G 2024 was a surprisingly impressive midrange phone, one that I had a hard time putting down despite costing less than half that of the flagship phones I tested in 2024. This year, the Moto G Stylus 2025 manages to step things up a notch in ways that I did not expect, and it may put other flagships on the spot, yet again.</p><p>While it's not exactly the AI powerhouse that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a> might be, Motorola has upgraded the Stylus 5G in other ways, mostly with better hardware specs and some improvements on the software front. The result is a phone that, at least on paper, feels like it should cost a lot more than it does at just $399.</p><p>I've had the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-launch-details">Moto G Stylus 2025</a> for a few days now, and while I'm excited to really put it through its paces, here are some of my favorite things that I've noticed, based on my early impressions of the phone.</p>

<h2 id="lets-talk-about-that-design-2">Lets talk about that design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4195px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JEar5HEf3JCAUNXiMyYagE" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-5" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JEar5HEf3JCAUNXiMyYagE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4195" height="2360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola seems to have settled on a design for 2024 and 2025, so the Stylus 2025 doesn't look too different from its predecessor aside from the larger camera housing. That's not a bad thing, and I quite like the design of the Stylus 2025, especially when you take its new colors into account.</p><p>Motorola began its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-special-edition-peach-fuzz-color">partnership with Pantone</a> a few years ago, a collaboration that has seen both companies applying some rather unique color options to Motorola's phones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-2024-razr-plus-pantone-rich-mocha-shade">such as the Razr</a>. The Moto G Stylus 2025 comes decked out in two Pantone colors, and while they both look great, Surf the Web really stands out with its vibrant blue-ish/ indigo hue.</p><p>The color looks great on the phone's frame and soft vegan leather back, giving it an almost neon vibe that I don't often see on smartphones.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4146px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eLb8rrL6W3yFPi9P7ScpCF" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-9" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eLb8rrL6W3yFPi9P7ScpCF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4146" height="2332" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Lately, Motorola seems largely against launching phones with the typical white or black color ways, forcing users to pick devices with a bit of flair added to them, even if they're just mid-range or budget phones. The Moto G Stylus 2025 follows this trend, looking arguably more attractive than Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series at half the price of the cheapest model (although the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-color-should-you-buy">Navy Galaxy S25</a> is a great one).</p>
<h2 id="the-front-looks-great-as-well-2">The front looks great as well</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-8" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wUFx5mDHqDckDJ4HDBFuTD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Then there's the display. Motorola has done a great job shrinking the bezels down on its Stylus phones, to the point where the Moto G Stylus 2025 could almost be mistaken for a flagship phone.</p><p>That said, there's more to the display than meets the eye, at least at first glance. Motorola is using an OLED panel with a "Super HD" resolution, which I admittedly hadn't previously heard of on a phone. With a 2712 x 1220 resolution, it appears to sit somewhere between a Full HD+ panel found on most mid-range and higher-end phones these days and a Quad HD+ display found on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">premium phones</a>.</p><p>The result is a display that's pushing more pixels than even the $800 Galaxy S25 while retaining a smooth 120Hz refresh rate.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>The Moto G Stylus 2025 has better display specs than the base Galaxy S25, a phone that costs twice as much.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Not only that, but the display can reach an impressive 3,000 nits of peak brightness, which is higher than all Galaxy S25 models, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. It also includes flicker prevention, which is great for people with PWM sensitivity.</p><p>This is arguably the best display on a Moto G phone, and I hope Motorola continues to incorporate more impressive displays into its devices, especially its flagship models like the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/official-motorola-razr-2025-teaser-clip">Razr 2025</a>.</p>
<h2 id="keeping-the-lights-on-2">Keeping the lights on</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4057px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GVJAHd8t4KkDoEjurRz5XD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-2" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 battery percentage and estimate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GVJAHd8t4KkDoEjurRz5XD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4057" height="2282" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>With display specs like that, it's natural to wonder about how battery life would be affected. After all, the Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 isn't the most powerful or efficient chip, and while the battery has a respectable capacity of 5,000mAh, I would have wished to see something larger.</p><p>Still, Motorola seems to have mitigated any concerns, rating the phone for over a day of use on a single charge. So far, the phone manages to exceed my expectations, easily lasting a full day in regular use. I hope to see how that changes as I use it more and the phone conditions itself to my habits, but so far I'm quite pleased with battery life.</p><p>But that's just part of the story.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3962px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-11" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 with a charging cable attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ViJ2uokj2nwsGnQXfcdk8n.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3962" height="2229" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Motorola outfitted this $400 phone with 68W wired charging and 15W wireless charging. These are specs I usually only see on higher-end <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phones</a>, so to see them on a phone this affordable is a very welcome surprise. I haven't quite timed how fast the phone fully charges yet, but it will reach 50% quicker than most other phones I've used, and I would feel more than comfortable walking out of the house at that charge.</p><p>It's nice that we're starting to see larger batteries, but being able to charge them quickly is also just as helpful. I really hope this becomes a norm for U.S. phones, especially at this price.</p>
<h2 id="everything-else-so-far-2">Everything else (so far)</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3833px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GM9qx4BHdQjWgPXFpq2xvD" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-3" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 stylus menu with the stylus on the display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GM9qx4BHdQjWgPXFpq2xvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3833" height="2156" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted, the Moto G Stylus 2025 isn't an AI powerhouse, so don't expect anything like a Pixel's Gemini Nano tricks here. That said, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> is honestly a feature I don't think I can live without on a smartphone, so I'm glad to see its inclusion here.</p><p>There's also a new Sketch to Image feature, which reminds me a bit of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-sketch-to-image-on-a-samsung-galaxy-phone">Samsung's feature of the same name</a>. I haven't played with it much, but early impressions are pretty good so far (anything that can produce a pretty spot-on R2-D2 out of a nearly indecipherable drawing is okay in my books).</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TRvj8ydKo5bP2KVegjHdYE" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-6" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 cameras" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TRvj8ydKo5bP2KVegjHdYE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very curious to see how the cameras fare in my testing. The newer Sony Lytia 700C sensor sounds very promising, and last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-stylus-5g-2024-review">Moto G Stylus 5G 2024</a> didn't disappoint in the imaging department. That said, I'm not sure why Motorola decided to include a color sensor, other than for uniformity on the camera housing, and I wish it had been left out.</p><p>And of course, there's a built-in Stylus. Like last year's model, the stylus has a much more robust design and doesn't look or feel as cheap as previous models. I don't expect S Pen levels of precision on this passive stylus, although the company says it has 6.4X more responsiveness than its predecessor. I do find it interesting that Motorola's passive stylus keeps getting better as Samsung continues to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">remove features and functions from its S Pen</a>... but I digress. 🍵</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DQ2NEo2V7K6itLnASsYZBn" name="Moto-G-Stylus-2025-hands-on-10" alt="Moto G Stylus 2025 next to the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQ2NEo2V7K6itLnASsYZBn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've only had the Moto G Stylus 2025 for a few days and will be testing it more ahead of my full review, but I'm already surprised at just how good this phone feels to use. In the wake of fairly mediocre phones that are somehow priced even higher, the $400 Moto G Stylus 2025 feels like a big step in the right direction for not only Motorola but for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a>.</p><p>Along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13r-review">OnePlus 13R</a>, the Stylus 2025 shows that you won't have to pay a ton of money for a flagship experience, whether that's with a ton of cool AI features or with impressive hardware.</p><p>I only hope that other companies are watching, especially in the U.S., where the midrange smartphone market seems to have stagnated. At this point, it feels as though the Android underdogs like OnePlus and Motorola are pushing the needle in any meaningful way.</p>
