<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Pixel users are dealing with a screen brightness glitch after the March update, mostly when watching videos in fullscreen.</li><li>Some Pixel 9 Pro users also noticed wallpapers dimming while icons stay bright, hinting at a broader display bug.</li><li>A temporary fix is turning off Smooth Display, but that means losing the 120Hz refresh rate, making scrolling less smooth.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>A growing number of Pixel users are speaking up about a screen brightness glitch hitting their phones after the March update, and it seems to kick in mostly when they’re watching videos in fullscreen.</p><p>Google’s March Pixel Feature Drop <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">rolled out some handy upgrades and fixed a few key bugs</a>, but as usual with software updates, there’s always a chance for new quirks to pop up after the fact.</p><p>Reddit users are now flagging a screen brightness glitch presumably tied to the March Feature Drop, mostly messing with video playback (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-phone-brightness-bug-3533289/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). One Pixel 8 Pro owner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j596zm/netflix_brightness_bug_after_a15_qpr2_update/" target="_blank">shared their experience</a>, mentioning constant, annoying shifts in brightness while streaming Netflix, with the screen cycling between too bright and too dim.</p><p>The user specifically blamed the March Feature Drop for the display glitch, noting it wasn’t an issue before the update. Many others backed this up, pointing to the update as the cause. And even with adaptive brightness turned off, the problem stuck around, so that feature’s definitely not the culprit.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> user also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5khf5/brightness_issue/?rdt=46254" target="_blank">confirmed</a> the brightness issue, noticing the same flickering on Prime Video, not just Netflix. Other Pixel users have reported similar problems on Disney+ and YouTube, making it clear this isn’t just an app-specific bug.</p><p>Another user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j543po/wallpaper_very_dark_after_march_update/" target="_blank">noticed</a> that on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, wallpapers look dim even at max brightness, while icons stay as bright as expected. Several Pixel 8 users chimed in with the same issue, suggesting this might be a wider problem across multiple models.</p><p>It looks like the brightness glitch is popping up across a bunch of Pixel models, from the Pixel 6 series all the way to the Pixel 9. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j5llvm/netflix_brightness_flickering_issue_after_march/" target="_blank">Pixel 7 Pro user</a> even figured out a specific trigger on Netflix where the flickering only happens when subtitles are turned on.</p><p>One Pixel 9 user found a quick fix, though it comes with a trade-off. Turning off the Smooth Display setting stops the flickering, but it also locks the screen to a 60Hz refresh rate instead of the smoother 120Hz. That means scrolling and animations won’t feel as fluid, but at least the brightness issue is gone.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

<ul><li>The DOJ is still pushing Google to sell Chrome, and maybe even Android, to break its search monopoly.</li><li>Selling Chrome would give other search engines a real shot at a broader reach of users, as per the filing.</li><li>The DOJ dropped its demand for Google to sell AI investments but wants stricter oversight.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The US Department of Justice is once again <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">pressuring Google to divest Chrome</a>, with the goal of challenging its dominant position in search and promoting fair competition.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.tn.gov/content/dam/tn/attorneygeneral/documents/pr/2025/2025-3-google.pdf" target="_blank">revised filing</a> to Judge Amit Mehta, the DOJ is doubling down on its push for Google to sell off its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-browsers">web browser</a>, and maybe even Android. The agency argues that breaking up these key assets is the only way to fix Google’s monopoly problem.</p><p>A group of 38 state attorneys general and the DOJ have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tn.gov/attorneygeneral/news/2025/3/7/pr25-13.html" target="_blank">teamed up</a> to file the updated proposal laying out the final steps to break Google’s illegal stranglehold on the search engine market. It stays close to the original one <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-could-be-forced-to-sell-off-chrome-to-level-the-search-playing-field">submitted to Judge Amit Mehta last November</a>, following his historic ruling that Google is a monopoly in online search.</p><p>In its latest filing, the DOJ argues that forcing Google to sell <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks">Chrome</a> would break its grip on a key search gateway, opening the door for real competition. It also kept an earlier proposal to stop Google from cutting deals with companies like Apple, phone manufacturers, and Mozilla to lock in its search engine as the default.</p><p>A key change in the DOJ’s updated proposal is ditching the demand for Google to sell off its AI investments. Instead of an outright ban, the agency is moving toward a more watchful approach, requiring Google to give regulators a heads-up before making any moves in the AI space.</p><p>The DOJ is also holding off on forcing Google to sell Android for now. Instead, the court will keep the option on the table, ready to step in if the current fixes don’t level the playing field. If competition doesn’t improve, Google might have to let go of the operating system down the line.</p><p>Google is expected to counter the proposals with its own. In its December filing, the company slammed the DOJ’s initial demands as over the top, calling them an "interventionist agenda" that went way beyond the court’s ruling. Google argued the case was about its deals with partners, not the massive overhaul the DOJ is pushing for.</p>

Some were gimmicky, while others clearly put some thought into making things practical.</p><p>The Liberty 4 Pro is the latter, and not only do they sound good, but they also give you some valuable controls for your earbuds when you’re in Zoom meetings or just listening from the desktop and want to control your sound.</p><p>Here are my full thoughts on the Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro.</p>

<p>The Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro are available from soundcore.com and Amazon for $130. You can pick up a pair in Glossy Black, White, and Glossy Light Blue.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review" target="_blank">Liberty 4 NC </a>went on sale pretty regularly, and the Liberty 4 Pro did see a $30 price drop during the holiday season, so it’s reasonable to think you’d be able to get a better deal if you’re patient.</p>

<p>Let’s get right to it! The sound produced by the Liberty 4 Pros is powerful! You get a soundstage with headroom to spare, boomy bass, punchy mids, and output that has you rarely needing to raise the source volume higher than around 65% of max.</p><p>Though not the highest durability rating, the Liberty 4 Pro should be able to handle whatever workouts you throw at them with an IP55 rating for water and dust ingress. They ship with Bluetooth 5.3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a> support for hi-res wireless audio, along with Spatial Audio support. You get Easy Chat, which is an audio ducking feature that “hears” conversation and lowers the audio volume so you can carry on a conversation.</p><p>There are <em>a lot</em> of customization options on board here, including five additional earbud tips in the box, not including the medium ear tips that are installed by default. The remaining wealth of options can be found in the app. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>The big marketing push with this latest iteration of the Liberty from Anker’s Soundcore brand is the case. It has some cool features that are expanded when you use the app. The default is that when you take the earbuds out of their case, you’ll automatically see the battery status, and then the screen transitions to controlling ANC.</p><p>This isn’t a touch screen likely because it’s so tiny that your finger would cover the majority of the screen real estate. Instead, you get a touch bar below the screen to control the ANC slider.</p><p>Going into the app and the <em>Charging Case Settings</em> menu, you can turn on spatial audio controls, atmospheric ANC status display, a Find Device feature that allows you to ring the case and earbuds independently if you can’t find them, and a remote camera shutter function if your phone supports it. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> did support it and worked flawlessly as long as the camera was launched first on the phone.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-case-closed-alt.JPG" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KvajgqZxRXjauBsiTFhKnU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>My only gripe is that with the transparent lid shut, you can only control the default setting, ANC. When activated from the app, all other options can only be accessed with the lid in the open position.</p><p>I wonder how many people will use the case, though, because you can access ANC and spatial audio options from Android and iOS widgets. The Find Device functionality is likely the only case function that is worth pulling the case out for most people.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU" name="soundcore-liberty-4-pro-smart-screen-touch-pad" alt="Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro showing smart screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/632WdUrakesUG4JYG5rZYU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro touch bar, with the case closed </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I think that the case functions will be most useful as a desktop remote extension of the app like a smartwatch is, to a great degree, a useful extension of your phone. Unlike your phone, you don’t need to unlock the case to access the default features or those you add to it via the app. So, the case sitting on your desktop while you’re doing work is the ideal use case for the touch bar and smart display.</p>

<p>As the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/anker-soundcore-liberty-4-nc-review">Liberty 4 NC</a> did, the Liberty Pro gives you a lot of features for a reasonable price. Battery life is just under six hours in my testing at 65% of max volume on my Google Pixel 9. The great thing is that you can get four hours of playback time with just five minutes inside the charging case.</p><p>The battery isn’t the only aspect that has juice! The power output is wonderful. On a Pixel 9 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, I rarely had to have the volume higher than 65%. A pet peeve of mine is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">Bluetooth earbuds</a> that require me to crank the volume to the maximum to get robust audio.</p><p>For a $130 pair of earbuds and in true Soundcore style, the Liberty 4 Pros punch above their weight. They’re definitely tuned for popular music, but their clarity and sub-bass extension are delightful.</p><p>Listening to Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’,” you get a very clear sonic picture of the beautifully layered instrumentation. The horns are crisp, the upright bass is thumping with a deep resonance, and the sparse vocals that are layered somewhat in the background are easily audible.</p><p>However, there’s more moanin’ to be had. Art Blakey’s version of “Moanin’” is where you get a sense of just how bright the Liberty 4 Pro can be as the horns on that composition become fatiguing after a bit. As entertaining as the sound profile is, it doesn’t sacrifice anything at the higher frequencies.</p><p>Listening to other tracks like the “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” from the “Get Out” soundtrack and “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” soundtrack show off the enormous soundstage of these mid-level Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

<p>The Liberty 4 Pro is indeed a solid performer, but nothing is perfect. As intriguing as the Smart Display and its functionality are, I’m not a huge fan of the fact that you’ll have to open the case for anything other than the ANC slider option. You can see through the case, so why have to open it for other functions?</p><p>Regarding sound quality, the 4 Pros can be a bit bright, so depending on the genre, your listening session may become a tad fatiguing. Thankfully, if that’s the case, there are EQ options to help tamp down that top end a bit.</p><p>And you'll definitely want to play with the different sound profiles a bit. Out of the box, the Liberty 4 Pro is definitely tuned for popular music, so the sonics are heavier on the low end and a tad lighter when it comes to nuance.</p><p>The previous generation Liberty 4 NC has better noise canceling, so if you’re asking if you should upgrade to these, I’d say “no.” ANC isn’t significantly better with the 4 NC, but it is enough of a difference, without a significant difference in sound quality, that an upgrade is far from necessary.</p><p>Last, depending on the fit of your ears, the earbud volume controls could be a bit of an annoyance. You use a sliding motion on the stems to increase or decrease volume. It works quite well, as do all of the other controls, but sliding at the stem could dislodge the earbuds a bit.</p>

<p>We saw some fantastic competitors emerge in 2024 in the mid-range noise-canceling earbuds market, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds" target="_blank">you have some solid alternatives</a> here. First, I’d take a look at both Nothing earbuds, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-a-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear (a)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/nothing-ear-review" target="_blank">Nothing Ear 2024</a>. The latter fully competes on features with the Liberty 4 Pro, though its case isn’t as “smart.” They do have better EQ settings with the ability to adjust frequency bandwidth, but it will cost you roughly $20 more.</p><p>You also have ‘buds like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a>, the JBL Live Pro 2 TWS, and a shrewd buy if you pick up one of Jabra’s “end of life” Elite 10 (gen 1) or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/jabra-elite-8-active-gen-2-review">Elite 8 Active</a> earbuds. All are solid competitors to the Liberty 4 Pro, though if you prefer the stem style, you’ll want to skip Jabra’s products.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-soundcore-liberty-4-pro-should-you-buy-them"><span>Soundcore Liberty 4 Pro: Should you buy them?</span></h2>
<p><strong>You should buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Super fast charging</li><li>You want Hi-Res Wireless Audio support</li><li>You want a case that supports some earbud controls</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy Soundcore's Liberty 4 Pro if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Top-tier noise canceling is mission-critical</li><li>You aren’t a fan of stem-based touch controls</li></ul>
<p>The Liberty 4 Pro gives you a case that is larger than the previous generation Liberty 4 NC, but you’ll have to decide if its features are worth the increase in size. In every other metric, the experience you get is quite good for earbuds in the mid-range market, especially considering that you’ll save around $30 compared to some competitors.</p><p>For solid music reproduction, great call quality, and the ability to use the case as a desktop extension for controls, you should definitely take a look at Soundcore’s Liberty 4 Pro if you’re in the market for mid-range Bluetooth earbuds.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Strava may be the most popular fitness app in the world, with 135 million users and counting, 51 million logged activities per week, and 1 million communal clubs. But its new Athlete Intelligence shows Strava isn't resting on its laurels, and it wants you to know that its AI isn't "just an LLM," even if you might assume that.</p><p>On Wednesday, I watched cheerful Strava employees celebrate the opening of their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/stravas-new-global-headquarters-signals-growth-and-innovation">new San Francisco HQ</a> after a brief speech from San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie. He called Strava the "tip of the spear" to convince people that "San Francisco is open for business" and "the greatest city in the world."</p><p>Strava's multi-floor office focuses more on celebrating the <em>world</em> of fitness if anything. I toured the office with CEO Mike Martin and Chief of Staff Shelby Rhodes, who showed me meeting rooms named after internationally beloved segments like Central Park or Alpe d’Huez. I also saw a live Strava Photo Map that highlights photos that their AI labels as "beautiful" from around the world, as well as employees' bibs from their favorite races.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi" name="Strava-sf-map" alt="A gif showing a full map of San Francisco, with lines representing each Strava user's live public route that day starting around 5am" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ywVuEqo8UTrwZfMzbdBzsi.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But my favorite exhibit focused on SF: a live, chronological map of the city that showed the live flyover progress of local Strava users' activity that day. It's an incredible effect, and I told the Strava execs that they should seriously consider upgrading its weekly heat maps to let users see the previous day's activity, at least in the big cities. They don't have any plans for it, but hopefully, I planted the seed for it to happen.</p><p>Add in the library of running books and wall art showing people's GPS-made art, and it was nerd heaven for a runner like me. But as much as I enjoyed the tour, my main objective was to sit down with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-ushers-in-its-next-era-with-appointments-of-new-chief-product-officer" target="_blank">CPO Matt Salazar and CTO Rob Terrell</a> to dive into <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/strava-announces-stable-athlete-intelligence-anti-cheating-and-flyover-sharing">Athlete Intelligence</a> — and figure out where Strava is going next.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they couldn't say too much that's new about their "future roadmap," but I still got a sense of where Strava Athlete Intelligence could go next.</p>
<h2 id="athlete-intelligence-has-room-to-grow-2">Athlete Intelligence has room to grow</h2>
<p>Athlete Intelligence just left beta, and Strava claims "80+% of users say that Athlete Intelligence is very helpful" based on in-app feedback. I myself have noticed a definite improvement in the accuracy of the data, but I asked Salazar and Terrell what their vision of Athlete Intelligence is and how it benefits users.</p><p>Terrell explained that "it was important to me that Strava do something that was much more significant" than the "low-effort" LLMs out there that spit out vague answers and can only give generalized advice from Google.</p><p>Even if "from the outside, it looks like it's just an LLM," their goal was to "really synthesize the granular data that we have about the users' activity and do deeper analysis with machine learning to understand the context of that data."</p><p>Salazar, in turn, noted that "not all people are at the same experience level to interpret heart rate zones or their pace." Their AI makes this data "much simpler and easier to understand" for beginners who might not understand the impact of anaerobic activity or who don't want to check back at old activities to see how their pace has changed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8" name="strava-athlete-intelligence-screenshots" alt="Screenshots showing Strava's Athlete Intelligence: Left - an LLM summary of the athlete's half-marathon run and comparative effort to past runs; center: an LLM summary of how their pace compares to past runs above pace stats; right: an LLM summary of the runner's most common HR zone and the intensity of the workout above a HR chart." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eidmzxBKfN5ni6cGkzTgt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Strava's AI primarily focuses on runs, hikes, walks, and cycling. I asked about their plans to expand to other activities, and Salazar explained that even as they "make sure it covers everything," eventually, they want to ensure first that "when we put out something, it's a sufficient quality," and that other sports might need more internal testing before it's "fully baked."</p><p>I then noted that Athlete Intelligence is very responsive rather than proactive: It tells you how you did after the fact but doesn't necessarily recommend a training plan or target pace for <em>future</em> runs as you get on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a>. Will that change?</p><p>Salazar said that they're not specifically looking for "the next AI thing we can do," but rather "how do we help users achieve their goals?" Up until now, that's been through incentives like challenge badges, monthly goal targets, and kudos from friends. But AI is one "particular tool that we're looking at" that could come into play next.</p><p>Terrell agreed that Strava "historically has been a backward-looking product" that largely leaves planning in users' hands and that while they're "not announcing any products" on this front at this time, they are "interested in...being forward-looking."</p><p>Even without any specifics, a more proactive form of Athlete Intelligence would make it more useful for beginners <em>and</em> serious athletes, so consider me hopeful that this evolution comes next.</p>

<p>The most passionate response I got from Terrell, Salazar, and even the CEO was when I jokingly mentioned the time I didn't get credit for a half-marathon PR because my watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/sf-half-marathon-distance-controversy-shows-need-for-accurate-gps-watch">didn't measure the full 13.1 miles</a>. Apparently, a lot of users want Strava to "fix" this and aren't at all amused about it.</p><p>I frequently test the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-and-fitness-trackers-gps">GPS accuracy of smartwatches</a> and know how fallible they can be. But plenty of Strava users don't realize that — as Terrell put it — the app is "limited by the accuracy of devices that users are using" and that they want to be "as accurate as possible" rather than "fudge" the data.</p><p>Strava itself said in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-dethroned-garmin-on-strava-in-2024-heres-why">Year in Review 2024</a> that 72% of Strava activities come from users' phones, which aren't necessarily as optimized as smartwatches when it comes to GPS accuracy.</p><p>Users can trim activities if they forget to pause before driving home, but letting users <em>add</em> distance to a run is a slippery slope. Yes, sometimes GPS inaccuracies give you the wrong data, but sometimes, it's the course itself that's short. Strava's team wants to be "truth tellers...when folks are trying to compare themselves against each other, especially at a pro level," Salazar explained.</p><p>"When we first joined, Matt and I were like, 'Let's just fix it. This is easy!' And then we dug into it, and it's like, oh yeah, there's nothing—," Terrell said, with Salazar jumping in with, "there's a lot of steps, yeah."</p><p>"We understand the user pain here, and we're looking for ways to solve it, but there's not an easy answer," Terrell concluded.</p>

<p>I also asked if Strava would ever consider using its segment leaderboards to create official race leaderboards on Strava. They themselves said that more than half of runners at major marathons like NYC, Boston, and London logged their races on Strava last year, so what if runners could see how they ranked among Strava users and compare their race times against previous years?</p><p>Salazar answered very carefully that they "can't speak towards future roadmap, but...all I can say is that that use case is very important for us, and it's very much present in our minds. So I'm thinking about how we can help users celebrate that moment; we know it's a moment they want to celebrate."</p><p>While this isn't exactly a confirmation, it does make me optimistic that Strava might be working on race leaderboards that make it easier to connect with fellow racers you met. Labeling races and grouping times might make it easier for Athlete Intelligence to rate your effort compared to others in your age group and gender, which would be enlightening!</p>

<p>Just in 2024, Strava added Athlete Intelligence, weekly and night heatmaps, a dark mode, and closer integrations with Oura and Apple Fitness Plus. So far this year, they've improved leaderboard integrity, made it easier to share your workout flyovers to brag on social media, and just this week added <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://press.strava.com/articles/strava-introduces-proprietary-map-rendering-engine">3D FATMAP terrain data</a> designed for winter sports athletes to see gradients, aspects, and even the nearby danger areas for avalanches.</p><p>Strava didn't have any other future info to share yet, aside from telling me about FATMAP the day before its reveal. But I did get Strava's execs to hint at "future stuff that we shouldn't talk about," in their words.</p><p>When I asked if Athlete Intelligence — which currently seems to focus on your last 30 days of activities for relative effort — would ever look at older data or take into account goals like "training for a marathon," Terrell circled back to his initial point:</p><p>"We're not just stuffing a prompt into an LLM; we are building custom models that will allow us to do different levels of interesting analysis. And what we can feed into the LLM will be much more specific to the users, sort of their lifelong fitness journey. So the LLM is going to be able to speak to a much broader array of aspects of your active life."</p><p>Salazar jumped in to agree that they're always asking "how can we develop more sophistication in what insights we can give the users," and that Athlete Intelligence "is not <em>done</em> by any means." They'll continue to grow and smarten up the feature, making it more useful for a wider range of athletes.</p><p>It'll be fascinating to see how Strava's AI efforts compare against a hypothetical <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/gemini-on-wear-os-will-be-much-needed-but-tricky-upgrade-for-assistant">Gemini Coach in Fitbit</a> or the Samsung Health Coach coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6#section-one-ui-7-watch">Wear OS 6</a>. At the moment, Strava has a head start on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> and doesn't intend to slow down.</p>

However, that cushion might be starting to wear thin, leaving us to wonder whether the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra is still the best that money can buy.</p><p>Samsung made a couple of surprising decisions with its flagship tablet lineup, of which only one really affects the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>. Dropping Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek was a bold choice, but besides that, it might look like there's not really much of a difference when compared to its predecessor. So let's dive in and see whether that's the case or if there's some kind of hidden magic.</p>

<p>No matter what your feelings are when it comes to using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablets</a>, sometimes it's best when a company recognizes that it doesn't need to make any drastic design changes. That's exactly what Samsung has done with the Tab S10 Ultra, as it seems like we just have updated internals packed inside of the same shell from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s9-ultra-review">Tab S9 Ultra</a>.</p><p>That means if you're upgrading from the previous version, you won't have to shell out a bunch of extra cash for new cases or accessories. This was something that drove me absolutely mad when Samsung went from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/day-in-the-life-galaxy-tab-s8-ultra">Tab S8 Ultra</a> to the Tab S9 Ultra. Thankfully, it's not an issue this time around.</p><p>Externally, literally, everything remains the same, with the exception of the colors on the Tab S10 Ultra. The 14.6-inch AMOLED display is as beautiful as ever, making it perfect for getting work done, playing games, or propping it up to watch a movie.</p><p>Oh yeah, and the S Pen is still included in the box, which was to be expected but is still welcome.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-16" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected wirelessly to Samsung monitor via Samsung DeX" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/avuQxMo2wSET4Cxtb7a3i4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The best part is that the possibilities of what you can do with the Tab S10 Ultra are practically endless. I've used it as an external monitor for both my desktop and gaming handheld, a smart home dashboard, a digital notebook, and more. In fact, I'm writing this on the Tab S10 Ultra using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>, which is connected wirelessly to my 49-inch Samsung OLED ultrawide monitor.</p><p>It's a bit odd, sure, especially because the giant 14.6-inch display is currently doubling as a massive touchpad. That's because this kind of just happened on a whim, and the Ultra is connected to Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-cases">Book Cover Keyboard Slim</a> (the one without a built-in trackpad.) Of course, connecting a mouse would make more sense, but I kind of like how I can just reach up and have the world's biggest touchpad.</p>

<p>To quickly recap, the Tab S10 Ultra is basically the Tab S9 Ultra that gets one extra year of updates. Well, not <em>exactly</em>. In a move that still surprises me, Samsung went with the MediaTek Dimensity 9300 Plus instead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> or even the 8 Gen 3.</p><p>But to be quite honest, except for one very specific niche, you wouldn't know it. And that's a good thing because if that weren't the case, Samsung would have much bigger problems on its hands.</p><p>So why would Samsung move away from Qualcomm in favor of MediaTek? That's right, you guessed it — AI. The Galaxy Tab S10 Plus and S10 Ultra are being touted as the company's "first tablets purpose-built for AI." But before getting too ahead of ourselves here, let's see how the Dimensity 9300 Plus compares to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 from the Tab S9 Ultra:</p>

<p>While single-core scores match up with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediateks-new-dimensity-9300-chip-brings-higher-clock-speeds-and-better-ai-processing">Dimensity 9300 Plus</a> destroys its competitor in multi-core Geekbench AI. Which just so happened to be the two key areas of focus when Samsung introduced the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>However, I would go so far as to say that you wouldn't notice a difference if you were asked to use either of these in some sort of "blind test." On the one hand, that's great, as it would be a very different story if Samsung's flagship tablet ended up performing worse. On the other, you might've hoped to see more of a jump in the single-core performance.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-11" alt="microSD card hanging out of the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hWQGjqFurzPqcXGCvJiiXR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Especially if you happen to see what the Snapdragon 8 Elite can do in the Galaxy S25 with its 3,025 single-core score and 9,640 multi-core score. Mind you, that's for a phone that costs $400 less than the base model Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra. Furthermore, the 8 Elite launched after the Tab S10, so it makes sense we didn't see it here.</p><p>Nevertheless, there's almost nothing to really complain about when it comes to performance. You'll still enjoy Samsung's suite of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, paired quite nicely with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a>. So, I can only hope that Samsung has left enough overhead for any other potential AI features that we'll see in the years to come.</p><p>Oh, and remember how I said that Samsung essentially kept the design the same as the Tab S9 Ultra? That also goes for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">microSD card slot</a>, which is a welcome inclusion on any device, let alone one that can serve as a gaming and media playback behemoth.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-5" alt="Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra playing The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom via Sudachi with the GameSir G8 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zhKQT29jEE2YpfG8rc5naR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Giant monitors and trackpads aside, my Tab S10 Ultra usually resides in DeX mode. I don't really have much reason to ever go back to "regular" Android because it's all icky and annoying there. Well, at least for tablets of this size.</p><p>With Google finally working on a proper desktop mode for Pixel devices, it only further drives the point home that certain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">Samsung tablets</a> should default to DeX mode out of the box. And if doesn't want to do it for every tablet, the Tab S Ultra should be the first.</p><p>The traditional Android experience still doesn't work well on tablets or even foldable phones. App scaling is weird; apps don't play nice when going beyond the confines of a narrow rectangle, and sometimes even the interface just looks odd. DeX solves most of those problems with a little help from One UI.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-14" alt="iPad Pro M4 next to Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with keyboard cases" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/afJDKZtkLTawmas8tyDAZR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It makes total sense for Samsung to just embrace the idea of the Tab S Ultra providing a Microsoft Surface experience, powered by One UI and Android. However, this leads me to another issue that I was hoping it would solve but has yet to do so.</p><p>Samsung needs to "borrow" Apple's iPad Pro Magic Keyboard design.</p><p>I applaud the company for making it so you can use the Tab S9 Ultra cases with the newer model. Technically, there are two "new" keyboard cases that launched alongside the Tab S10 Ultra. But the only real difference is the addition of the Galaxy AI key next to the arrow keys.</p><p>Unfortunately, you have a tablet that can double as a laptop, but it's arguably one of the most uncomfortable "laptops" that you'll ever use. With the Book Cover Keyboard, everything works fine, but try using it with your Tab S10 Ultra on your lap, and you'll immediately want to pull out your hair.</p><p>The Book Cover Keyboard Slim is slightly better, as it's a bit more rigid than its counterpart. However, you miss out on the trackpad, which is fine in some instances but isn't the ideal experience for everyone.</p>

<p>Whenever I get a new Android device, whether it's a phone, tablet, or gaming handheld, the first thing I try to do is see how well it can handle <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulation</a>. Most modern devices can handle up to PS2 games fairly easily. The <em>real</em> test is seeing how well Switch emulation performs.</p><p>That's where my first annoyance about the move to MediaTek came to mind when I heard the rumors. Graphics drivers for MediaTek devices are... well... they just don't quite stack up to Qualcomm. They'll easily handle systems with mature emulators, but once you start getting into Switch and Windows emulation, it's an entirely different story.</p><p>I won't bore you with the details, but basically, Qualcomm devices allow for the use of custom driver support and Vulkan extensions. If you ever hear about "Turnip" drivers, these are custom-compiled drivers that are used in a variety of emulators, including Switch, 3DS, PS Vita, and others.</p><p>These drivers can offer improved compatibility along with increased performance, which sounds great! Until you learn that you won't be able to use these custom drivers with MediaTek's Mali drivers. This ultimately means that if you try to emulate one of your favorite Switch games only to see that it gets between 10-15fps, you're simply out of luck.</p>

<p>There's one more thing about the Tab S10 Ultra that continues to bug me. For whatever reason, Samsung's "Ultra" tablet isn't available with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/does-samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-series-support-5g">cellular connection</a>. This has bugged me for the last few iterations, but after learning that those in Europe can choose between having Wi-Fi or cellular, I was hopeful that the S10 Ultra might be a deviation from that pattern.</p><p>Sure, it's not a problem with the Galaxy S10 Plus, so if you really want mobile connectivity, that's still an option. But what about those of us who prefer the larger display? Especially considering that the S10 Ultra is essentially a super-sized and Android-powered Surface Pro.</p><p>I understand that it would only make this already-expensive device cost even more. But at the same time, I don't understand Samsung's rationale when it comes to limiting or holding features from its "Ultra" devices.</p>

<p>For the first time in a few years, I feel like there's some real competition in the higher-end Android tablet space. While nothing else can really match up in terms of the display, there are now options that can keep up with Samsung's flagship tablets.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> is the first that comes to mind, simply because of how much of an improvement it is over the previous model. We have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a gorgeous 3K LCD panel (which is great for PWM), and Open Canvas offers a different take on multitasking. Plus, even if you decide to pick up the Stylo 2 and Smart Keyboard, it will still cost you less than the Tab S10 Ultra.</p><p>It's a similar story, at least on paper, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/lenovos-trio-of-new-tablets-have-something-for-everyone">Lenovo Yoga Tab Plus</a>. This was announced at CES 2025 and has flown under the radar a bit, but maybe that will soon change. Lenovo, too, opted against going with the Snapdragon 8 Elite but instead relies on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. You'll also enjoy a 12.7-inch 3K display with a 144Hz refresh rate and 16GB of RAM. Lenovo includes both a stylus and a detachable keyboard in the box.</p><p>Last but certainly not least is the big elephant in the room, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review" target="_blank">Apple's iPad Pro</a>. It has everything you could want from a laptop replacement — a big and vibrant screen, an excellent keyboard, and you can even get cellular if you want. However, the biggest caveat is that it's running iPadOS, and while that might be great for some, I still wish Apple would give us macOS on this hardware.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want the biggest tablet that money can buy</li><li>You want a tablet that can replace your laptop</li><li>You're already entrenched in the Samsung ecosystem</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You're on a budget</li><li>You want a tablet with cellular connectivity</li><li>You don't need a screen this massive</li><li>You want to enjoy retro emulation and need the best compatibility</li><li>You already have the Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra</li></ul>
<p>Frankly, the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra isn't for everyone. That statement would be true even if we had the Snapdragon 8 Elite or 8 Gen 3 over the Dimensity 9300+. It's cumbersome to use as a traditional tablet, even though the 14.6-inch display is perfect for media consumption and playing games.</p><p>If you were to ask me for a recommendation, I'd probably tell you to just get the Galaxy Tab S10 Plus. With the extra money saved, you could spring for more storage or grab one with cellular connectivity. However, even that opens another can of worms when you look around at competing tablets with a similarly-sized screen.</p><p>That being said, there's a reason we chose this as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/android-central-best-of-2024-chromebooks-tablets">best tablet of 2024</a>. There's nothing quite like having a device of this size powered by Android. If you do decide to pick up the Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra, I highly recommend enabling DeX as soon as you get everything set up. It just makes more sense than being confined to the traditional Android UI.</p>

<hr>
<p>Some Google Maps users are running into a weird issue where their entire Timeline history is disappearing. No one’s sure why, but many suspect it has something to do with Google’s recent move to store location history directly on devices instead of in the cloud.</p><p>Google Maps' Timeline feature has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps-gets-rid-of-another-feature-on-web">undergone a major shift in how it handles location history</a>. For years, all that data was stored centrally, tied to your account. But starting in December of last year, Google made a big switch, meaning your movement history now stays on your phone instead of Google’s servers.</p><p>The company is giving users until June 9, 2025, to switch over to on-device location history. After that, anything still stored in the cloud will be gone for good.</p><p>Google’s push to decide what to do with years of location history left a lot of users sweating. With a deadline looming, people had to figure out how to save their data before it was too late. Now, some users are finding their Timeline history has vanished into thin air even before the deadline arrives.</p><p>Users are sounding the alarm on Reddit (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5l70a/timeline_disappeared/" target="_blank">1</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleMaps/comments/1j5bjps/timeline_deleted/" target="_blank">2</a>) about disappearing Google Maps Timeline data, and the issue is picking up steam, as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-maps-timeline-missing/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. In just the past day, tons of people have chimed in, saying their Timeline history has mysteriously vanished too.</p><p>People are reporting that years of their location history have suddenly vanished without a trace. Even though their Timeline is enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/15-best-google-maps-tips-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Maps</a> is showing the same frustrating message across the board: "No visits for this day."</p><p>To make matters worse, some users can’t even access their cloud backups anymore.</p><p>Some are pointing fingers at Google Maps’ shift to move location history from the cloud to your device as the likely culprit. The change was supposed to beef up privacy, but it might be causing this mess instead.</p><p>So far, the problem hasn’t popped up on our devices, which suggests it might not be hitting everyone. We’ve reached out to Google for answers and will update this story as soon as we hear back.</p>

Samsung, Google, and Apple have all been implementing AI on their smartphones in a way that feels disjointed. Some features are better than others, and some are genuinely useful. However, it's tricky to describe Google AI, Galaxy AI, or Apple Intelligence as a unified experience.</p><p>After more than a year of sitting on the sidelines, Nothing is debuting its mobile AI with Nothing OS 3 on the Nothing Phone 3a series. It notably chose to work on these AI concepts instead of building the flagship Phone 3, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call">and I criticized that move</a>. More than six months later, the move might have paid off because the Essential Space on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> is arguably my favorite AI feature so far — and I've tried them all.</p><p>Essential Space is the hub for AI features in Nothing OS, and it's designed specifically for the Phone 3a series. Both the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro have the Essential Key, which is a hardware button that lets you immediately save things to your Essential Space. It works anywhere in the operating system and can serve as a "memory" for things you do on your phone.</p><p>Nothing might've deserved more faith in the first place because it's impressive to see in hindsight how similar Essential Space sounds compared to Nothing CEO Carl Pei's teasers from June 2024. "It’s important we get the product right, integrating hardware and AI in a way that is both useful and brings a smile to people’s faces," Pei <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/1798369533889302576?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1798369533889302576%7Ctwgr%5Eada3b2445a5f9d380c7d3cf95196b4d22c359f66%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fphones%2Fnothing-will-prioritize-ai-over-phone-3-but-is-that-the-right-call" target="_blank">said</a>.</p><p>With a hardware Essential Key and an AI-based Essential Space, the Nothing Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro seem to have delivered on the company's promises.</p>

<p>So, the Essential Space is like an AI "memory" for your smartphone. If that goal sounds familiar, it should. It's the same ambitious feat other AI features like Pixel Screenshots and Microsoft Recall tried to achieve.</p><p>In practice, those tools aren't really serving as your smartphone's memory. They're more like record-keepers. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">Pixel Screenshots</a> will organize your screenshots, but it's on you to remember why you wanted to screenshot what you captured in the first place. So, the app becomes like the screenshots folder in your phone's gallery app — a wasteland for old and forgotten screen saves.</p><p>Unlike those offerings, Essential Space sets itself apart by doing more in one place. In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/heres-what-i-want-from-nothing-phone-3-after-using-phone-3a-pro">my hands-on with the Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a>, I described Essential Space as being similar to a hybrid of Pixel Screenshots, Pixel Recorder, and Keep Notes. Those are some of my favorite apps on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, but I never knew I needed them to be more tightly integrated until I used the Nothing Phone 3a.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB" name="Essential-Key-Record" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rTWE6YhWSZMUcsNMXRiCuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I can take a screenshot with the Essential Key by clicking it once and quickly add a text note or a voice note right there. This helps me chronicle why I saved something, and it also gives the Essential Space some context as to why it's important. From there, my screenshots will get sorted, notes analyzed, and voice recordings transcribed.</p><p>On a Google Pixel or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, I would've had to use multiple apps to get the same experience. It would've taken a lot longer, too.</p><p>The best part of Essential Space is what it can do on its own <em>after</em> you've taken a screenshot or recorded a note. It'll identify any action items or important details in your saves and can remind you of them later. For example, I added a discount coupon to the Essential Space and got a push notification a day before it was about to expire. On another occasion, I got a reminder to go on my next running workout after I saved a screenshot of the results from my last one.</p><p>To be clear, Nothing's implementation of mobile AI isn't perfect. The Essential Key is poorly designed, as it's too large, too shiny, and positioned too close to the power button. Meanwhile, the Essential Space app could use more features. It's a hub for your Essential Key saves, and only that.</p><p>The app is <em>so close</em> to being my go-to for notes and reminders, but there's no way to create a note, recording, or reminder in the app without using the Key.</p><p>But that's all forgivable because the whole experience works together seamlessly and lives under one roof — the Essential Space app. I can't say the same for Google AI and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a>, and all the independent and disjointed features under those umbrellas.</p>

<p>AI's surge over the past few years has involved companies trying new things, seeing what works and what doesn't, and copying each other. As such, brands like Google and Samsung should take a close watch on what Nothing is doing with the Essential Space. It wouldn't take much for either company to develop something similar for their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a>.</p><p>They already have the individual features built, and some of them are better than what Nothing offers. They just haven't figured out how to fit all the pieces of the puzzle together in a way that makes sense, and somehow, it seems like Nothing has.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has swapped out the name “Gemini Extensions” for something simpler and snappier: "Apps." Along with the new name, these apps are also getting a boost with a version of Gemini 2.0 that makes them faster and more efficient.</p><p>If you’ve been using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> on your phone or computer lately, you might’ve noticed that the old "Extensions" menu is now called "Apps." Google confirmed the switch in its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/03/release-notes-03-07-2025.html" target="_blank">Workspace Updates blog</a>.</p><p>Google has made it clear that this name change is just a surface-level update. This means that everything works the same as before, so your experience won’t really change.</p><p>That said, a bit of an adjustment period is inevitable as people get used to the new label. So, if you find yourself pausing for a second to spot the "Apps" menu, you’re not alone—it’ll just take a little time to feel familiar.</p><p>Gemini Apps give Google’s AI chatbot the ability to connect with all sorts of web services and mobile features, going way beyond just answering questions. From pulling up your calendar to summarizing videos or kicking off an audio stream, it’s designed to handle real-time tasks that go beyond basic information lookup.</p><p>Google has fully rolled out the name switch on Android, iOS, and web. You’ll see "Apps" popping up everywhere now, replacing "Extensions" in settings, account menus, and all the main features of the platform.</p><p>The Mountain View-based company is no stranger to renaming and reshuffling its services, but this change seems more intentional. This latest shift feels like a move to make these features feel more like a natural, built-in part of the Gemini ecosystem.</p><p>On top of the name change, Google is rolling out something new under the hood: Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental. Google says it’ll give users a smoother, smarter experience, especially if you’re someone who leans on these tools a lot.</p><p>Google has been steadily evolving its reasoning models. It started with the first release in December, then rolled out an improved version for developers in January. Last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-2-0-flash-thinking-and-pro-experimental-models-are-hitting-the-gemini-app">Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental made its way to all Gemini users</a>, whether you’re on the free plan or paying for premium.</p>

There's a bit of Google in just about every corner at the show, but in the midst of all the excitement on the show floor, I was able to sit with Seang Chau, VP and GM of Android Platform, to discuss what to look forward to in 2025. And while AI underscored nearly everything on the docket, we also dove into Android 16's accelerated timeline and the plan to improve update support across OEMs.</p><p>Improving Android updates across the board seems to be a major focal point for the company this year, from improving the timing of device launches to making it easier for OEMs to support software longer than they traditionally have. And while this may not be as exciting as new Gemini features, getting everyone on the same page with Android updates is just as important, if not more so.</p>

<p>When the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-developer-preview-1-is-here-with-new-features-and-a-snappier-release-timeline">Android 16 Developer preview</a> commenced, Google announced that it was making a major change to its schedule. Instead of following its usual launch timing, the stable update would launch sooner, specifically in Q2. This means we can expect the update to arrive by June at the latest, putting it months ahead of previous releases.</p><p>When I asked Chau about the accelerated timeline, he said there are multiple reasons why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> is coming so much sooner.</p><p>"The first is, we're getting feedback from our OEM partners that 'Hey, the earlier you can release, the more likely we can push new [software] when we launch a new handset in that same year.'</p><p>Because if you look at some of the biggest releases during the year, if we're releasing a new Android version in August or September, it's really hard to release a phone that same year with the latest release, and then you have to wait however many months before you get the latest Android release."</p><p>This was especially true last year when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> launched in August last year without the latest Android release. Even though the phones arrived a bit earlier compared to the previous release, many found it strange that Google waited until <em>after</em> they were released to push <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a>.</p><p>Many flagship or sub-flagship launches happen in the second half of the year, which made the timing of previous Android releases tricky. Samsung is one of those companies that launch new phones in July or August, which means they usually come with last year's software before the company launches a beta and eventually the stable version later in the year, <em>usually</em> starting in Q4.</p><p>With Android 16 set to arrive much sooner, this <em>should</em> help companies avoid that awkward launch window after a new update has been released. That means the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> should come with Android 16 out of the box. The new schedule means new phones from other OEMs can get the new software and hopefully be updated sooner.</p>

<p>Chau also notes that another reason the company moved up the Android 16 update is because the company "wanted to be able to move faster with respect to APIs." And while the move is partially AI-driven, he says that, ultimately, it just makes sense.</p><p>"As quickly as the market is moving, and as quickly as our developers need to be able to move in order to build new functionality, especially around AI, we need to make sure that we can add that capability and those APIs multiple times a year.</p><p>So, in order to do that, it didn't make sense to release something in August or September, and then, like, a couple months later put out another release with an API update."</p>

<p>Updating a phone is one thing, but it's another thing to continue pushing updates for a phone for years after the device is launched. The Pixel made the first major push for extended update support, promising <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pixel-9-software-updates">seven years of OS upgrades and security updates</a>. Samsung then followed suit with its flagship Galaxy phones.</p><p>But that kind of support hasn't been common in the Android space, and it definitely takes a lot of resources to provide it. This is why the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/qualcomm-collaborates-with-google-bringing-extended-support-to-certain-android-phones">announcement</a> from Qualcomm and Google is such a big deal, making it easier for OEMs to support their devices for up to eight years. That said, while we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-unveils-commitment-to-7-years-of-os-and-security-updates-for-the-magic-series">Honor join the seven-year club</a>, it's ultimately up to OEMs if they want to bring that level of support to devices. Chau says he hopes the move will encourage more OEMs to follow.</p><p>"One of the driving factors around this is sustainability, of course, but really, it's so that you can keep your devices longer. And if you decide to pass that device down or return it, you're able to retain more [secondary market] value." Chau says the hope is that longer support for devices will help drive more adoption of Android phones, with consumers knowing their devices will remain secure for years to come.</p><p>In fact, this is partially what drove some long-term Pixel users that I know to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/convincing-friends-ditch-older-pixels-buy-google-pixel-6a">upgrade from their Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 devices</a> after support ended for them. Though they were intrigued by the affordable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a>, they eventually pulled the trigger when the Pixel 7 launched with improved update support (which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-confirms-the-pixel-6-pixel-7-and-pixel-fold-will-get-two-extra-android-os-upgrades">since been extended</a> by another two years), especially since they were not planning to upgrade again for a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL" name="Google-Pixel-7-Pro-hazel-camera-module.jpg" alt="Holding the hazel Google Pixel 7 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdiK7Q7ghKH8DTyU9CzbRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google's Pixel phones have arguably the best software update policy, and now, that level of support can be extended to other devices, although it wasn't without its challenges.</p><p>"One of the biggest barriers was SoC support," Chau notes, highlighting that the transition to Tensor SoC helped bring that level of commitment to Pixel phones.</p><p>"One of the challenges, of course, is Linux as the underlying operating system. The long-term support period for different versions of Linux kernels was actually shortened. So, we had to work with the SoC vendors and our partners to make sure that we could actually upgrade the kernel." He notes that this has been very difficult in the past, which highlights the importance of this new collaboration with Qualcomm.</p><p>For now, the eight years of support is supported on the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a>, which powers today's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a>. However, this will also extend to future 8-series chips as well as future 7-series chips, which are expected later this year.</p><p>What's more, Qualcomm notes that this support can lower costs for OEMs interested in adding extended software support for their phones. As someone who loves <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phones</a>, I hope this means the company <del>can</del> will add better (and faster) support to its newer devices.</p>

<p>With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates">Android 16 still in beta</a>, Chau wasn't able to talk about what we can expect from the stable update later this year, but he did note that despite some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/why-would-google-promise-seven-years-of-updates">rhetoric around extended update support</a>, Google is focused on making each update better than the last and making things more efficient.</p><p>"We've promised seven years of updates on Pixel, and we worked with Qualcomm to get to eight years. I see a lot of sentiment, shall we say, like 'Who cares about eight years because it's going to make it worse' and all these other things. We're really working hard to make sure that that's not the case.</p><p>Every release, we want to make sure it is better than the last one, including performance, battery life, etc."</p><p>Chau recognizes that some features will require more power, which is par for the course when it comes to updates. We recently saw this in action with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25 series</a>, which has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">features that require the new Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> for AI processing, which aren't available on previous models. It's also just as common with Pixels due to more powerful chips being able to handle more power-hungry tasks.</p><p>Still, Chau says Google tries to offset this by finding gains elsewhere, which can sometimes mean a bump in performance when a new update rolls around, even if a feature or two are sacrificed due to a lack of power.</p><p>Ultimately, the question becomes, "How do we make the releases better so that we're not making your phone worse?"</p><p>Fortunately, with the new Android 16 release schedule and a promise to help OEMs update their phones longer (and hopefully faster), 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal moment for Android updates.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-22">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>New Google Photos API changes are cutting off automatic syncing for some digital photo frames like Aura and Cozyla.</li><li>Starting March 17, Aura users will need to manually add photos, and Cozyla users are in the same boat.</li><li>Google announced these changes last September, and they officially take effect on March 31.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s recent changes to how third-party apps can access Google Photos have thrown a wrench into things, causing headaches for a bunch of digital photo frame makers.</p><p>For years, digital photo frame companies have used <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a>’ tools to easily pull in your pictures and keep them updated. But now, thanks to some recent tweaks to those tools, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623306/google-photos-digital-photo-frame-auto-sync-going-away" target="_blank">The Verge</a> reported, those handy connections are getting cut off, leaving a few digital photo frames in the lurch.</p><p>Google’s updates to its Photos API were meant to boost user privacy, but they’ve also disabled automatic syncing for some devices, like Aura and Cozyla frames. This means those once-smooth slideshows of your favorite pet album won’t update like they used to.</p><p>Before the API changes, Aura’s app let users browse their Photos library and pick what to display on their digital frames. The ‘auto-add’ feature made it even easier by automatically syncing new photos to selected albums.</p><p>However, starting March 17, Aura is pulling the plug on its automatic Google Photos sync, as Senior Director of Communications Jenisse Curry confirmed. That means you’ll have to manually upload photos through the Google Photos app if you want to share new pictures with family on your Aura frame.</p><p>Cozyla is jumping on the same bandwagon and ditching its Google Photos auto-sync too, as per a Reddit thread. So, if you’re rocking a Cozyla frame, get ready to switch to manual uploads for your photo updates.</p><p>Google first unveiled the news about its Photos API changes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/photos/support/updates" target="_blank">back in September</a>, and now it's finally rolling out on March 31. According to Google, the updates aim to beef up user privacy.</p><p>While Google is phasing out this beloved feature, the tech giant is also working on new ways to let devices securely access your Photos library. Interestingly, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/326122731/more-eligible-devices-for-ambient-displays" target="_blank">recently hinted</a> at expanding Google Photos integration to more devices, like smart fridges and newer digital photo frames.</p><p>Google isn’t ditching digital photo frames altogether, but with backend changes in the works, existing frames could face some temporary or even long-term hiccups. The full details are still under wraps, so it’s a wait-and-see situation.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for a capable mid-range gaming laptop; you've liked other Chromebook or Acer options in the past; you want a laptop with a large, vivid screen featuring a high enough refresh rate for fast-paced gaming.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer a small keyboard and would be willing to sacrifice display size; you're looking for a laptop that includes a touch display.</p><p>The Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE is a powerful laptop, and Android Central's first pick in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook#section-best-for-gaming">best Chromebook for gaming </a>category.

It also sports an impressive battery life and performance that users love.</p><p>The Intel Core 5 120U backs solid performance for the price point, and this particular model features 8GB of RAM, though the laptop can also be upgraded to 16GB. As for connectivity, the Plus 516 GE includes two USB-C ports, an HDMI port, an ethernet port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p><p>While it is a great pick, it's also worth noting that it isn't a premium gaming laptop, just a good Chromebook for gaming purposes.

However, I'd go so far as to say that there is <em>one</em> company Google should license its technology, and it's not Samsung.</p><p>Despite releasing the first phone with an on-device assistant, Apple sat back and watched as Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa quickly surpassed Siri. While minor tweaks and "improvements" have been made over the years, Siri isn't anywhere near as reliable or valuable as Assistant and now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a>. It reached a tipping point with iOS 18, as Apple <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-gemini-and-other-ai-models-could-come-to-iphones-in-the-future">announced</a> it would be partnering with OpenAI to bring an enhanced version of Siri.</p><p>In addition to providing easy access to ChatGPT, Apple also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/delayed-one-ui-7-update-has-me-worried">stated</a> that Siri would offer Personalized Responses and On-Screen Awareness. Those features were already supposed to have been available, but Apple continues to struggle to get them out of the gate. Not only that, the "real" Siri upgrade might not be released for at least another year, if not longer.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>It might not be until 2027 before Apple releases the Siri overhaul that the iPhone needs. </p></blockquote></figure>
<p>This version of Siri is expected to be more akin to what we have with Google Gemini on Android. It's expected to be more conversational, along with actually performing tasks the same way that Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, and other LLM models do. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-03-02/apple-siri-compared-with-alexa-m4-macbook-air-and-ipad-air-2025-coming-soon-m7rn2k2y">Mark Gurman of Bloomberg</a> reports that this is initially expected to debut at WWDC 2025 before being rolled out this time next year.</p><p>Meanwhile, a rumor recently surfaced claiming that Google would introduce an all-new AI assistant named '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">Pixel Sense</a>,' which would essentially be the all-encompassing digital assistant that we've been waiting for. Instead of relying on different apps or "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/15146780?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid">Gemini Gems</a>," Pixel Sense is expected to leverage and process any of the user data that it's allowed to collect.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2268px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d" name="visual-intelligence-iphone-16-pro-1.jpeg" alt="Apple Visual Intelligence on iPhone 16 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3D2nGkMCfqSmhzostRA5d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2268" height="1276" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Given Apple's consistent struggles and delays in developing its own AI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai might want to consider calling up Apple CEO Tim Cook and saying, "Hey, we can help you with that." It's not like Google isn't already helping out, as Apple's Visual Intelligence already leans on Google for its results, basically implementing Google Lens with Apple's UI.</p><p>I'm not suggesting this just because I use an iPhone. If I want the best, I just reach into my other pocket and grab my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a>. I think Google would be well-served to try and get this in front of as many people as it can.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-13" alt="Gemini showing a Rick Astley video on the Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5Exu6T9MJe5QJVwJHQ8puM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is constantly talking about how it wants to continue improving Gemini and AI. It's partially why the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> series is packed with so many Gemini-powered features while other features make their way to the broader Android market. However, if Google wants to make the biggest impact, serving up Gemini on the iPhone is the best way I can think of.</p><p>It's not like iOS doesn't already have the foundation to make something like this possible. With iOS 18, Apple added "Extensions," which is how you are able to access ChatGPT when asking Siri a question that it can't answer. So, it's not entirely inconceivable that we could see a similar implementation.</p><p>As it currently stands, there's a dedicated Gemini app on the Apple App Store after it was initially integrated into the Google app. There was even a recent update that introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-iphones-slight-rework-lock-screen-apple-update">Gemini lock screen widgets</a>, making it even easier for you to talk to Gemini. However, even a lock screen widget won't be enough for some, as you might not think about it when you're in a hurry or prefer using the Side Button to invoke Siri.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8" name="google-gemini-lock-screen-widgets-iphone-16-pro-max" alt="Google Gemini lock screen widgets on iPhone 16 Pro Max next to Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qunooZwp5zNtuD5yxznFC8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is expected to launch this new AI as a "Pixel 10 exclusive." And while I understand the desire to keep features tied to specific devices for a period of time, Google could still choose to expand it beyond the Pixel and Android ecosystem.</p><p>Barring any hiccups, we could see the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> launched in August, with the iPhone 17 landing in September. That gives Google about a month of exclusivity for Pixel Sense before the two companies make some type of surprise announcement. Or instead of making Pixel Sense available on launch day for the iPhone, wait a month or two (probably after the holiday shopping rush) and release it as part of Apple's pre-Christmas/New Year break iOS update.</p><p>Then again, maybe the reason why we don't have a Gemini extension for iOS already is because it could likely spell the end of the Pixel line. What's the point in buying a Pixel if you can get the same experience on an iPhone?</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the last three days, Meta has published three in-depth explainers about how its upcoming Meta Orion glasses work, focused on its custom silicon chips, holographic waveguides, and wireless compute puck. It's a refreshing change of pace to see Meta let its engineers be so geekily passionate about their work.</p><p>Meta's Reality Labs team leaked a lot of information about future Quest headsets and AR glasses until Meta started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-issues-a-stern-warning-to-employees-about-leaks" target="_blank">issuing anti-leak warnings to staff</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/labor/621059/meta-fires-20-employee-leakers" target="_blank">firing accused leakers</a>.</p><p>The tech world has always been hyper-fixated on secrecy while despising whistleblowers, leaving its biggest fans dependent on unreliable leaks and fake rumors as they wait for new products. By the time a product launches, the waters are muddied by leaks with incomplete or exaggerated information, making a device look worse before the engineers are allowed to explain the context.</p><p>So that's what makes Meta's current approach with Meta Orion so refreshing. Yes, this is a public proof-of-concept of Reality Labs' work rather than a marketable product, but by eking out information about these glasses <em>now</em> instead of waiting until 2027, it helps inform the public on the challenges of AR glasses engineering and why they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-plans-to-spend-billions-on-ai-2025">spending billions on research</a> to address them.</p><p>Whether you're an old "Glasshole," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a> owner waiting for an upgrade, or a Quest fan curious about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/zuckerberg-wants-billions-of-ai-glasses-worldwide-is-that-possible">AI glasses</a> in general, I highly recommend you read Meta's three blog posts for yourself. But I'll summarize the highlights below.</p>

<p>In Meta's blog post, titled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-custom-silicon-chips-ip-blocks-accelerators-ar-algorithms-energy-efficiency-reality-labs/" target="_blank"><strong>How Our Custom Silicon & Chips Are Revolutionizing AR</strong></a>, Meta explains why its AR glasses are "completely dependent" upon custom silicon instead of mobile-style chipsets.</p><p>"The glasses form factor can only dissipate so much heat, and it can only accommodate so much battery capacity," the post explains. So "if you hold constant the thermal and battery capacities, the only way to deliver a given experience is to optimize the silicon."</p><p>Director of SoC Solutions Robert Shearer explains that they had to "reduce power consumption by a factor of 100" before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> glasses would work.</p><p>Some of that came down to the wireless puck, but even that required "custom compression protocols to reduce bandwidth and power consumption as data moved from the compute puck to the display, says Director of Product Management Neeraj Choubey. He also described how they used machine learning to reduce the power needed for on-glasses eye and hand tracking.</p><p>The post proceeds to explain how this team also designed the custom silicon in the Orion microLED displays. Display Architecture Technical Director Mike Yee explains how they had to reduce the gap between pixel centers from "tens of microns" on phones to "the single digits," which would only work on silicon.</p><p><em>Then,</em> they needed to develop a "custom power management chip" that fit in the "tiny corner" of Orion's displays to power the holographic content.</p><p>This only scratches the surface of the blog post, which is mostly a platform for this team to brag about how they're "breaking free from traditional mental models" to make custom silicon. But considering the years of reports about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-laying-off-reality-labs-employees-behind-custom-silicon">Meta laying off this team</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-mediatek-announce-partnership-custom-ar-silicon">relying on MediaTek</a> for its silicon, I'd say they deserve some time in the spotlight.</p>

<p>The post on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-silicon-carbide-waveguides-ar-glasses-large-field-of-view/" target="_blank"><strong>Our Silicon Carbide Waveguides & the Path to Orion’s Large FoV</strong></a> explains how Meta took advantage of a surplus of silicon-carbide material made for EV cars to make it a "viable option for AR glasses" because of its "high refractive index."</p><p>Optical Scientist Pasqual Rivera says traditional glass lenses make AR glasses an unsightly rainbow "disco." Silicon carbide was initially so "nitrogen-doped" that it was too dark to ever be used for glasses, but Meta's team realized that it's a "total game changer" with incredible clarity when it's not optimized for cars.</p><p>AR Waveguides Tech Lead Giuseppe Calafiore explained how they had to stack multiple glass plates to hit a refractive index of 1.8, making glasses "prohibitively large and ugly." So they tried different materials and eventually settled on silicon carbide, which can hit a 2.7 index with a single plate for better "etendue," aka 50% better light spread for a wider field of view (FoV).</p><p>The post explains that wider FoV on AR glasses can cause "ghost images and rainbows" but that silicon carbide has properties to reduce them, as well as better thermal conductivity.</p><p>That said, the problem is undoubtedly price. Meta's post concludes with Director of Research Science Barry Silverstein saying, "We’re seeing signs that it’s possible to significantly reduce the cost," but that implies that for now, AR glasses either have to settle for worse materials or cost an arm and a leg for a functional display.</p>

<p>The third blog post about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/orion-compute-puck-reality-labs-next-computing-platform" target="_blank"><strong>Orion's computing puck</strong></a> explains why Meta quickly abandoned the idea of using a phone to power its glasses because "demanding performance requirements would drain the phone battery and suck away compute capacity from phone use cases."</p><p>It then goes behind the scenes on how they envisioned the puck as a fully functional controller for AR games with 6DoF sensors and haptics, but that they've turned off those functions for the final version to focus more on eye/hand tracking and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-semg-wristband-whitepaper">EMG band</a>. Still, one could imagine enthusiasts and devs getting those functions working if they wanted to.</p><p>That's partially why I think this blog post isn't just about boasting. It explains to skeptics why they chose a puck instead of a phone, curtails any false rumors about the puck being a controller in the final product, and explains the power demands AR glasses have that necessitate this weight in your pocket.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC" name="meta-orion-hands-on-2024-wrist-band-03" alt="Going hands-on with Meta Orion smartglasses and using an EMG wristband for input" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eWhgi5xoXf4aYK3bkUYjTC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And <em>that</em> brings me back to my original point: I want more companies to let their engineers geek out and explain themselves <em>before</em> products reach the final stage. It primes journalists and hobbyists about the technical side of these products well before launch so they're less reliant on leaks while also building up hype for products and features.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/valve-asus-and-samsung-vr-headsets-fill-niche-that-quest-abandoned">Leaked XR headsets like Valve Deckard</a> have had VR super-nerds pouring over Valve's code for years, looking for hints of what to expect. I'm not saying Valve should reveal its product early, but it's been a long 5+ years since the Index launch with almost nothing VR-related aside from the occasional Steam Link update. Some behind-the-scenes info on what they've been working on would've been a nice nod to its patient fans.</p><p>I doubt Meta will let its engineers loose to talk about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> anytime soon, nor its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">leaked smart glasses</a>. But since we all know these devices are coming, it'd be nice if Meta let loose enough to give us some hints and let engineers brag publicly about their work instead of assuming it can fire everyone until the leaks stop.</p>

This made us think about what exactly the company was thinking while creating these devices.</p><p>For instance, Samsung's claw-like tri-fold, which looks like a flip but would fold on both ends, leaving half an inch of gap in the center. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.</p><p>Next up is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Tecno Spark Slim</a>, which looks cool and is the world's slimmest phone with a 5,200mAh batter, measuring just 5.75mm in thickness. It gets better, at the rear, the camera bar looks like a futuristic robot's eyes, connected by LEDs with unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels. Hope you're taking notes, Samsung!</p><p>Xiaomi took accessorizing to another level, with a custom Xiaomi 15 showcased at the event that had a large magnetic ring on its rear that could attach a bigger camera lens, instantly converting your phone into a DSLR camera.</p><p>Some of the other things that the AC team spotted were Honor's AI-powered robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with, Nubia Focus 2 Ultra, which features a ring around the camera housing that can be physically rotated to control the zoom, UAE's Humanoid robot that kinda creeped them out and more.</p>

<p>How much should anyone be paying for a phone case? The question is highly debatable, but I'm sure you've asked yourself this before. After all, smartphone cases these days range from as low as $10 or maybe even less and can go all the way past the $100 mark.</p><p>I know it sounds insane to spend $100 or more on a phone case. For a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap phone that costs about $500</a>, that's already a major fraction of the price of the device itself! As ridiculous as it may seem to be, sometimes it's actually worth the splurge. There are many reasons why you'd want such an expensive phone case.</p><p>But before dishing out my own opinions, I'd like to share what others have told me regarding the matter. I went around asking my colleagues how much they were <em>willing</em> to spend on a case on average. Their like-minded answers highlighted a pattern in buying phone cases.</p>
<h2 id="what-most-people-prefer-to-spend-on-cases-2">What most people prefer to spend on cases</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4288px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6" name="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch - 1.JPG" alt="Dbrand Grip Case for Pixel 7 Pro in Camo Glitch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9k8m9gWc3LBYZtbig2ZjJ6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4288" height="2412" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I asked Android Central writers how much they'd be willing to spend on a phone case. Here's what some of them had to say on the matter. Phones editor Nicholas Sutrich says his max is $20 "unless it's something really special like a Thinborne." Android Central contributor Tshaka Armstrong had a similar response, saying he'd spend about "$20-ish on Amazon but much more if it’s a brand I trust AND the case has design elements and materials that justify the higher price."</p><p>Meanwhile, news editor Nandika Ravi says she'd spend "Anywhere between $50 to $60 at the most."</p>
<p>Typically speaking, most of Android Central's staff find it appropriate to spend about $20 on an everyday phone cover. The only exceptions come in when a notable brand is involved.</p><p>Why is there an exception when a popular brand comes into play? According to the vox populi, it's all about the build quality and reliability of the brand. Trustworthy phone case makers ensure your phone cover is made of the highest grade materials and actually delivers on the drop protection promises made.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I once paid for an official leather case and realized my running lifestyle made it a waste: it got sweat-stained and ruined, so I had to replace it after a few months. Now, I try to keep it simple. I do pick the more reputable companies, but I wouldn’t pay above $40.</p><figcaption><cite>Michael L Hicks, Senior Editor, Wearables & AR/VR</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>When a name brand is involved, most members of our team — and probably the general public — are willing to stretch their budget to a certain extent.</p>
<h2 id="why-brands-matter-2">Why brands matter</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4535px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg" name="Peak-Design-Case-MagSafe-Comparison.jpg" alt="MagSafe accessories on an iPhone and Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P23QYiTSYmXRmnZHu8xtqg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4535" height="2551" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Can you get a cheap case from retailers like Amazon? Yes, of course you can. However, the issue arises with no-name brands selling poor-quality silicone, low-grade TPU, or faux leather phone covers, touting them to be "military-grade drop-resistant" when the truth is far from it.</p><p>This is exactly why brands matter and why some folks are willing to spend up to $60 on a protective case for their smartphone.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Name brands have a reputation at stake and a face to save. If a company like Spigen promises 20ft drop protection, you know that a research & development team actually put the phone cover to the test. It's no wonder an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/spigen-case-saves-iphone-from-16000-foot-fall">iPhone survived a 16,000ft fall from a moving airplane in a Spigen case</a>.</p><p>Let's not forget about the insanely slim yet incredulously rugged Arc Pulse case for the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL. Sutrich doubted the structural integrity of such a minimalist Pixel 9 case <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-arc-pulse-case-impressions">in his review</a>, but then he dropped it on concrete. This eye-wateringly expensive phone case will set you back $90, but you'll also get the satisfaction of knowing it can live through anything.</p><p>Thus, when a brand like CASETiFY promises impact-proofing on its bumper covers, you can rely on the case to be that tough in actuality. Because if it isn't so, unsatisfied customers know where to find them and how to shame them, perhaps going as far as suing for false advertisement.</p><p>Good luck trying to do any of that with the $3 knock-off you got from Temu. Accountability is non-existent in that scenario.</p>
<h2 id="the-bottom-line-2">The bottom line</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y" name="Tudia-cases-nothing-phone-2-honor-magic-6-pro-boox-palma-02.jpg" alt="Tudia cases for the Onyx Boox Palma, Nothing Phone 2, and Honor Magic 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D3KvosfDFfgMsrTjZc9A9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Here's where I pipe in with my own thoughts. I've been covering phone accessories for several years now, so I can positively reassure you. Brands are important, but that doesn't mean you need to spend $100 for a functional and sturdy phone case.</p><p>Plenty of awesome brands are also accessibly priced. Just look at Spigen, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/tudia-phone-cases-stock-up">TUDIA</a>, TORRAS, and ESR, to name a few. Even their flagship phone cases for Samsung and Google are priced around $20 or less. I could go on and on, but my point has been made.</p><p>Names like these are proof that a tight budget doesn't automatically compromise the quality of the phone case you can afford.</p><p>At the end of the day, buy a phone case from a reliable brand that fits your budget. It doesn't matter if it's $15 or $150. As long as you do your research on the brand's history, you'll be solid.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Pixel 9a's release may be just around the corner, and while we anticipate learning more about the phone — several leaks have been coming in hot.</p><p>The most recent one gave us a good look at how the alleged hardware and design of the device. Coming from avid tipster<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/evleaks/status/1897836775290085404" target="_blank"> Evan Blass</a> are what seem to be official marketing images of the Pixel 9a. In an X (previously Twitter) post, Blass showed off alleged renders of the mid-range phone.</p><p>In terms of the hardware, the Pixel 9a seems to have flat edges, rounded corners, and an end-to-end screen. Additionally, the images confirm what the previous leaks have been pointing towards— the mid-range device could be losing the signature Pixel camera visor. Instead, it will have a pill-shaped housing flush with the rear panel of the phone.</p><p>However, in another image showing the phone horizontally, a sliver of the camera bump seems to exist— indicating that the company may not be letting go of the bump altogether.</p>

<p>As indicated in previous leaks, the Pixel 9a could come in four colorways: Black, silver, pink, and Lilac, but the official names of these colors remain under wraps so far. That said, in the subsequent thread, Blass shows off some of the Gemini's features that could supposedly show up on the Pixel 9a.</p><p>To start, one image shows a person triggering Gemini by holding down the power button. The other images seem to indicate that the phone will come with Android 15's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">anti-theft protection</a> and several cameras, calling, and general Pixel ecosystem features.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-renders-cases-and-fcc-listing-leak" target="_blank">leak that popped up </a>earlier this week indicated that the Pixel 9a could come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-use-satellite-sos-on-google-pixel">satellite connectivity</a> out of the box. The mid-range phone is said to have shown up for FCC certification with the digital label explaining, "The satellite feature on this device must be turned off at all times while on board an aircraft by turning on airplane mode," which is similar to what showed up on the flagship model as well.</p><p>It is important to note that several features that show up in leaks may or may not make it to the actual device. However, here's a detailed list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">what we expect</a> to see from the upcoming Google Pixel 9a.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google Pixel 9 users can now shoot pictures and videos from different angles as Google is starting to roll out the new Connected Cameras feature to these phones (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/pixel-9-connected-cameras/">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Connected Cameras is a feature that was announced along with the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Pixel update</a> that came in early this week. This will allow <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9</a> owners to connect to another camera placed at a distance (either a GoPro or a Pixel phone) and use it to live stream and record videos.  Users can livestream through any of the supported social media applications like Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, etc., while being able to use the in-app filters on their videos.</p><p>This is particularly useful for people who want to set their phones aside to show off a skill or share their products during a livestream or even while simply biking with their GoPro.</p><p>To enable this feature, users need to head to the Pixel's <strong>Settings > Connected devices > Connection preferences > Connected Cameras</strong>. Here, you'll need to toggle the option on, as it doesn't appear to be enabled by default.</p><p>Once turned on, a floating "Camera Picker" icon will appear when using supported apps. This allows you to add, remove, or disconnect a remote camera as well as switch devices.</p><p>That said, when the Camera Picker isn't in use on the above-mentioned social media apps, it remains minimized. Users can also disable the icon by touching and holding it, then dragging it to the "X" at the bottom of their screen, Google explained on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/15985851?visit_id=638769908975773396-2413751535&p=connected_cameras&rd=1">help page</a>.</p>

<p>As of now, this feature is only available for Pixel 9 series devices. It can support secondary cameras using the Pixel 6 and later or the GoPro 10 and later, updated to the latest software version on them.</p><p>Lastly, it is important to note that users can only connect to one additional remote device at a time, and these devices need to be signed into the same Google account. You can switch the connected camera, but you'll have to disconnect the first one.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>TECNO had quite the showing at MWC 2025. The company launched its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-camon-40-series-launch">Camon 40 series</a> with a ton of new AI features, unveiled new AI glasses set to take on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses</a>, and even has a new lightweight Snapdragon-powered PC. However, the company also has a number of concepts to show off that make our current phones look outright boring by comparison.</p><p>Of course, the most interesting concepts we saw from TECNO are devices like the multi-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-tri-fold-phone-intrigues-me">Phantom Ultimate 2</a> and the ultra-thin Spark Slim. These aren't what I'm referring to, although they do give us a good idea of where TECNO wants to go. It's the other concepts that got me excited about what our phones could look and feel like in the near future.</p>
<h2 id="alternative-materials-2">Alternative materials</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="f2ZDCVmmAbvm9KXGTzCbCJ" name="TECNO-Coconut-Coir" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a coconut coir back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2ZDCVmmAbvm9KXGTzCbCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On display were several dummy models made using various materials, with the idea being to use sustainable or renewable options for phone designs. Among them was a model with a back made using coconut core. This is the outer shell of a coconut that is usually used to make various products like floor mats, mattresses, and other things. It won't smell like coconut, but it's a firm alternative to glass that looks very clean and feels great in hand.</p><p>On the opposite end, TECNO had a model made with used coffee grounds. This actually makes sense because Transsion, TECNO's parent company, has a coffee business in China, and what better way to bring the two together?</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J" name="TECNO-coffee-grounds-material-concept" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a back made of coffee grounds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DPAnhfu9AERfJt8PPHuX9J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Design-wise, it's perhaps not as attractive as the coconut coir, but it does look quite unique and could appeal to anyone who likes the more raw look. Furthermore, it actually smells quite good, and that's coming from someone who doesn't like coffee. Imagine how nice it would be to get a bit of a pick-me-up from a quick whiff of your phone!</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ" name="TECNO-Multi-Glass-Fiber" alt="A concept TECNO phone with glass fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fKn7ZuEfMjF2QiTqALMCQJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, TECNO had a phone made with an industry-first multi-colored glass fiber. For this, TECNO used a Jacquard weaving technique, with the end result being a phone that looks like it's studded out in diamonds. In fact, the company used what looks like a jewel in place of the red indicator light next to the cameras and the "o" in "Camon." It's a rather stunning design that can make any phone look premium.</p>
<h2 id="switching-things-up-2">Switching things up</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ" name="TECNO-photochromic-Cellulose-Acetate" alt="Concept TECNO phones with different colors activated with a UV light" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mZLKB8yPbCVBHCZyXJCpFJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>TECNO's concepts aren't only about using alternative materials. The company also wants to give us the freedom to change the look of our phones. These proofs-of-concept were probably my favorite of the bunch, as they added a bit of a dynamic nature to the designs.</p><p>Among these devices were a series of phones that use photochromic cellulose acetate, which allows the back cover to change color when exposed to UV light. The company had three phones set up, all of which appeared fairly normal at first glance. But when a representative shined a UV light onto them, they all changed color: one blue, one pink, and one green.</p><p>While I wouldn't expect anyone to carry a UV light around, I can only imagine how cool it could be to have my phone change color whenever I walked outside.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J" name="TECNO-Display-Electronic-Slurry" alt="A concept TECNO phone with a DES back panel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYbA5PSBKJmdpi25ToSF8J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3782" height="2127" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even more interesting is the concept that uses Display Electronic Slurry (DES) technology, as seen above. It essentially turns a phone's back panel into a video player with a high DPI and refresh rate, although it reminded me a lot of an E Ink display. Still, it was pretty cool seeing the phones flash with different images, and I imagine you could deck out your phone with whatever designs you want, switching things up to match your mood, outfit, and more.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J" name="TECNO-Starry-Optical-Fiber" alt="The Phantom V Flip 2 with TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SvVMapZ994vzGQqEDPEN2J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>And, of course, I can't forget about TECNO's Starry Optical Fiber. The company unveiled this at CES and integrated it into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-phanton-v-flip-2-review">Phantom V Flip 2</a>, embedding ultra-fine optical fibers and LED lights in a smartphone back cover. The result is a very out-of-this-world effect that can change between four different modes, and TECNO claims it doesn't impede battery life.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3878px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="YmdR28zhPESQUSAdWhmgzH" name="TECNO-Spark-Slim-stainless-steel" alt="The TECNO Spark Slim in stainless steel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YmdR28zhPESQUSAdWhmgzH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3878" height="2181" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Smartphone design has become pretty boring lately, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> launching as variations of glass and aluminum slabs, and the only way to stand out is with a unique color selection or an outlandish camera design. Look no further than any Samsung phone if you want an indication of how some of the most popular phones have thrown in the design towel.</p><p>Fortunately, we are starting to see more companies switching things up with materials like vegan leather and ceramic. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">TECNO Spark Slim</a> has a stainless steel back that looks like it came out of a Nubian starship from Star Wars, with a camera bar that brings the entire package home with LED lights that run between the dual cameras on either side.</p><p>Unlike the days of dumb phones where <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nokia-lg-downfall-made-phones-boring">companies like Nokia</a> could launch the most ridiculous designs (Lipstick phone, anyone?), the modern smartphone era doesn't have the luxury of particularly unique designs. Seeing how far TECNO is going to give our slab phones a new lease on life gives me hope that smartphone design can one day be exciting again.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google has reportedly slipped a new addition into an Android Auto version under development that could positively affect a driver's experience.</p><p>A small, iterative update to Android Auto's 13.9 beta was spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/android-auto-temperature-controls-code/">9to5Google</a> with new code teasing a set of new controls. The post states Google has added code in preparation to introduce vehicle air controls. The code seems a little strange, considering it doesn't specify <em>temperature </em>(like hot or cold), specifically.</p><p>What was found only states the pressure at which the air would flow out from your car's vents. According to the APK dive, Android Auto currently contains the following strings: "control_temperature_hi," "control_temperature_lo," and an "off" setting.</p><p>It seems odd that Google would opt for "high" and "low" titles instead of "hot" and "cold" for your car's heat and AC. Unfortunately, the true functions of these newly spotted settings are still unknown as the publication couldn't surface anything concrete.</p><p>If anything, these strings could be the early makings of a truly fleshed out temperature control experience with more to offer. As previously stated, this was found in v13.9.151004 of Android Auto. The post reiterates the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/02/28/android-auto-13-9-update-rolling-out/">v13.9 beta update</a> rolled out for testers a week ago, which was lackluster in terms of major updates. Google was mostly fixing bugs and altering the language of some of its features.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6" name="AAWireless-Two-adapter-next-screen" alt="AAWireless Two adapter next to aftermarket infotainment head unit." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wkMrxk3UdzSvXUHfAkpgr6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It also makes us wonder if Google will somehow make its temperature controls vibe with Android Auto's supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/android-auto-gemini-demo-showcase-reported">Gemini integration</a>. Earlier this week, a demo video surfaced showcasing how Android Auto and Gemini could work together to assist drivers. The AI contained basic functions for playing music through Spotify and answering questions about major landmarks. However, it was clear that Google may need to tweak how it helps users plan a trip.</p><p>The AI was pretty chatty, but offered very little specifics in the early stages of its "affordable trip" breakdown. It wasn't until the end where Gemini shaped up and offered some useful insights.</p><p>If Google is working to apply proper temperature controls in Android Auto, perhaps users could utilize it with Gemini — if things work out, that is.</p><p>Elsewhere, Android Auto's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto-appears-to-be-expanding-its-horizons-beyond-just-cars">13.5 update from January</a> showed clues about Google's eventual addition of more vehicles. It seems the company is preparing to welcome motorcycles into its automobile OS ecosystem.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons why I put up with Windows on a regular basis is some of the ways it integrates with Android. One such feature is Link to Windows, also known as Phone Link, which allows you to use your phone without actually needing to pick it up.</p><p>Even when it was introduced back in 2018, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/microsoft-your-phone-android-what-it-and-how-does-it-work">Phone Link</a> wasn't the app to offer this kind of integration. However, it was the first time that we saw this kind of experience built into Windows or macOS. The app has continued to evolve, including the ability to actually mirror your phone's screen right on your Windows machine.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qUHY3usyaUdQTBEgdkC62Z" name="microsoft-link-to-windows-app-windows-11.jpg" alt="Microsoft Link to Windows app on Windows 11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qUHY3usyaUdQTBEgdkC62Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Unfortunately, some Phone Link features, such as screen mirroring, have been limited to only working with certain devices. Until last year, only Samsung phones were available with Link to Windows built-in, but that's no longer the case as it's now being baked into more and more phones.</p><p>Another app was released in 2018 by the name of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy">Scrcpy (screen copy)</a>, which has continued to see regular updates since its initial release. The key benefit of using this over Phone Link is that you can use Scrcpy with <em>any </em>Android device. Just download the app on your Windows computer, enable USB debugging from your phone, fire up Scrcpy, and voila!</p><p>Over the years, quite a few forks of Scrcpy have been released, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/NetrisTV/ws-scrcpy" target="_blank">Ws-scrcpy,</a> which is a "web client prototype," or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/barry-ran/QtScrcpy" target="_blank">QtScrcpy</a>, which provides more settings to customize. However, I was recently preusing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-play-store-sucks-so-heres-what-i-use-instead">Droid-ify</a> and saw an app called ScrcpyForAndroid. Initially, I just figured it was a way to enhance the regular Scrcpy app, but boy, was I wrong.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-2" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid settings screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmiEabhDN7kBHr4Nx57dqN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Instead of offering more functionality between your Android device and Windows, ScrcpyForAndroid lets you achieve the same thing using two Android devices. Naturally, I immediately downloaded it, made sure I reset the adb port command, and connected the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-redmagic-10-pro-is-a-mobile-gaming-beast-and-it-just-scored-its-first-major-discount-at-amazon">RedMagic 10 Pro</a> to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><p>At first, it wasn't really quite as smooth as I would've hoped, with graphical glitches and delays making it practically unusable. However, I went over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/zwc456baby/ScrcpyForAndroid">GitHub landing page</a>, and there is a list of instructions. It turns out that I didn't set the resolution and bitrate to the correct figures. So after fixing those, I reconnected the two devices, and it's been working great ever since.</p><p>Apparently, ScrcpyForAndroid was first released in October 2024, and I'm surprised I had yet to come across it. Even still, this actually isn't the first time that I've used something similar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.65%;"><img id="P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa" name="oneplus-pad-2-review-10.jpg" alt="OnePlus Open mirrored on OnePlus Pad 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P62Bffj7YW5RzwkvpwPVa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1333" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad 2</a> introduced a similar feature built into the device, making it possible to use your phone from the tablet. However, this is only possible if you also have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">OnePlus phone</a>. Yet again, we have an awesome feature that's locked down by the manufacturer.</p><p>There are no such limitations here, as ScrcpyForAndroid doesn't care about what devices you're using. All that matters is that you have Wireless USB Debugging enabled on the phone before getting started.</p><p>That's not to say there aren't limitations, even when compared to the standard Scrcpy client app for Windows. For instance, you can drag and drop files between the two devices, but nothing happens. There wasn't an error message or anything; it just didn't work. Honestly, it's not a deal-breaker for me, as I'm just happy that this is even possible without needing to worry about having two devices from the same company.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-redmagic-10-pro-1" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to RedMagic 10 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wpy7XkTwn82JKQh35YzCwN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and just for chuckles, I tried side-loading the APK on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebook</a>. After again making sure the settings were right, I connected it to the phone and the RedMagic 10 Pro appeared like magic!</p><p>Then I got the wild idea to try and see if I could get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a> to show up on the Tab S10 Ultra's display. It's technically possible, provided that Developer Options are enabled, as you need to turn on Wireless Debugging. However, it doesn't quite work the same way as controlling a phone from a tablet or even a tablet from a Chromebook.</p><p>Instead of being able to see your entire screen, ScrcpyForAndroid only displays Android apps when used on a Chromebook. So, after you connect the Chromebook to your Android tablet, you'll only see the Settings app. A way around this is to open whatever Android app you want to use first and then start up the ScrcpyForAndroid connection. In reality, this probably isn't something that anyone would do, but hey, I at least wanted to give it a shot.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN" name="scrcpyforandroid-tab-s10-ultra-galaxy-chromebook-plus" alt="ScrcpyForAndroid running on Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra connected to Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VQ48K2fJDVFxSdvSa7U5uN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's clear that people want to be able to access and use their phones while also using a computer. As I mentioned before, Phone Link and Link to Windows have been around for years, while Scrcpy has been around for even longer. Google released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromebooks-laptops/how-to-use-app-streaming">App Streaming via Phone Hub</a> with ChromeOS 115, and with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/everything-ios-18-stole-from-android">iOS 18</a> and macOS Sequoia, Apple introduced iPhone Mirroring.</p><p>However, the overarching theme with all of these options is that you're limited in what devices are compatible or the features that are available. With Scrcpy, there are no such limitations, and it's just another reason why Android devices continue to prove to be more versatile than almost anything else.</p>

<ul><li>Gemini in Workspace is adding a Google Calendar side panel, starting out in Workspace Labs.</li><li>The test allows users to ask questions or create events using AI with Gemini.</li><li>You can sign up for Workspace Labs to try the feature, but there's no way to opt-out of Gemini in Google Calendar unless you leave Labs completely.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has been steadily <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-15-pro-side-panel-rolling-out-now-for-google-workspace-labs-testers">adding Gemini side panels to Workspace apps</a> and web clients, and Google Calendar is the latest web client to get that treatment. First spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/07/google-calendar-gemini-side-panel/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the side panel is currently being tested in Calendar as part of Workspace Labs. Google explains the full functionality of Gemini in Google Calendar in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/15985129" target="_blank">support document</a>.</p><p>The support document explains that Gemini in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/8-best-google-calendar-tips-hacks-and-tricks-you-need-know">Google Calendar</a> can help you check your schedule, create an event, or look up event details. Android Central was able to test the Gemini side panel in Google Calendar, which includes four suggestions for how you can use it:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Ask:</strong> Check my schedule for next week</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a weekly run to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create:</strong> Add a lunch event to my calendar</li><li><strong>Create: </strong>Add commute blocks to my calendar</li></ul>
<p>The example suggestions provide an idea of how Google sees Gemini in Google Calendar helping users, and it sure seems like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> can serve as an AI-based personal assistant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3394px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.39%;"><img id="4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA" name="Google-Workspace-Gemini-Side-Panel" alt="The Gemini side panel in Google Workspace." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4EVA9Nq5XRvpnukdc5SrA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3394" height="1778" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google explains that conversation history with Gemini in Calendar can easily be lost, including when you refresh your browser, close and reopen Calendar, or lose internet connection. Additionally, you can manually clear your conversation history by clicking the three-dot menu and selecting <strong>Clear history</strong>. Since this is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/duet-ai-coming-to-google-workspace-soon">Workspace Labs feature</a>, you might not always get a perfect response.</p><p>"Gemini for Google Workspace is constantly learning and may not be able to support your request," the company says in the support document. "If you get a suggestion that’s inaccurate or that you feel is unsafe, you can submit feedback. Your feedback can help improve AI-assisted Workspace features and broader Google efforts in AI."</p><p>The only way to disable this feature is to leave Workspace Labs, which is permanent. You'll lose all Workspace Labs features and won't be able to rejoin. You can sign up for Workspace Labs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspace.google.com/labs-sign-up/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>There has been a lot of chatter lately that Samsung could be skipping a couple of major software update steps and jumping straight to the next major software release.</p><p>It was just a couple of days ago that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">Iceuniverse took to X </a>with a bold claim stating the Korean OEM will likely be skipping the One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1 updates and instead will be bringing in a major One UI 8. This is a curious move where, even before officially releasing the much-delayed stable One UI 7 build for the majority of devices, it seems to be developing the new One UI 8.</p><p>Another leaker, Tarun Vats, seems to have spotted a new build in development indicating that the One UI 8 powered by Android 16 could likely be coming to the Samsung Galaxy S25 series. He claims that the company started developing the software update two months earlier than usual and that he spotted it being internally tested on the Galaxy S25 series. The build version is as follows:</p><p><em>S938BXXU1BYC1/S938BOXM1BYC1/S938BXXU1BYC1</em></p>

<p>Samsung seems to be fast-tracking its next update in an attempt to keep up with Google's Android 16 rollout that is set to take place in June, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-android-16-tricks-showcase-report">confirmed by the tech giant during MWC.</a> Also because of the lack of time to develop smaller UI builds before the One UI 8 hits devices.</p><p>Historically, Samsung drops its major software updates closer to October every year. However, this time around, with the OneUI 7, it's a different story. There's no doubt that the One UI 7 rollout has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">continuously pushed out</a> since last year, and now its stable version is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">set to drop </a>on devices only in April.</p><p>However, if Samsung is testing out the One UI 8 two months early, we're keeping our hopes up that beta versions of the build could show up earlier in the Fall.</p>

<ul><li>Google Home Max users are losing the sound detection feature in May 2025.</li><li>The feature is available for Nest Aware subscribers, and will remain for other Home and Nest devices.</li><li>Sound detection made it possible to receive notifications when your Home Max hears dangerous sounds.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the Home Max smart speaker back in 2017, and many are in use today. However, as the company recently communicated in an email to owners, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home-max">Google Home Max</a> is losing the sound detection feature (via<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-home-max-sound-detection/" target="_blank"> 9to5Google</a>). This feature used the Home Max microphone to listen for dangerous sounds, like glass breaking or a smoke alarm ringing, and sent a push notification to the user's smartphone.</p><p>It required a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-aware-vs-ring-protect">Nest Aware subscription</a>, but will be sunset for the Google Home Max on May 8, 2025. Google says that the feature will still be supported "on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription." It's unclear why the feature is being dropped specifically from the Home Max, although the speaker is getting old.</p><p>"Starting May 8, 2025, your Google Home Max will no longer have the sound detection feature as part of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-nest-aware-subscription-your-nest-camera">Nest Aware subscription</a>," the email reads. "Sound detection (which alerts you if glass breaking or a smoke/carbon monoxide alarm is heard) will still be supported on your other Google devices with your Nest Aware subscription."</p><p>Sound detection is useful for making sure you don't miss important security events while you're away from home. A notification that glass broke or that a smoke or carbon monoxide detector went off could help homeowners respond to problems quickly. It's especially helpful for people deep into the Google Home/Nest ecosystems, as you can look into live camera feeds to respond to sound detection pings if you have them.</p><p>As of now, sound detection will still be available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-home">Google Home</a> and Google Home mini hardware. 9to5Google points out that the Google Home Max runs an older firmware version, number 1.56.275994, than those other two models, which run 3.75.456944. This major disparity could be a reason why sound detection is being dropped.</p><p>The Google Home Max was discontinued four years ago, but still receives updates.</p>

An X user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/moto-g64-android-15-update-india/">91mobiles</a>) has shared the screenshot of the changelog, which indicates that the latest firmware is bearing the <strong>V1TD35H.83-20-5</strong> version.

<p>Per the changelog, the Android 15 update to the Moto G64 should make the device faster and more secure, which further includes smoother graphics, and faster app performance, amongst others. This update to the Moto G64 also means users can experience the new Hello UI skin on top of Android 15, which is said to be replacing the My UX skin popular through Android 14.</p><p>As 91mobiles notes, the Moto G64 joins the Android 15 bandwagon just like the Moto Edge 50 Neo which started receiving the update in January. The update is also said to include the latest security patch and notable bug fixes. As Motorola just started rolling out the update this week, users can expect it on their devices in the coming weeks as it is likely a gradual roll-out.</p>

It is the next clamshell phone from the company, which is expected to debut sometime in April.

On the inside, the device is expected to have a 6.9-inch pOLED display alongside a 4-inch cover screen, and the chipset powering the handset is likely the Snapdragon 8 Elite, which already powers a significant amount of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> released this year.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung is reportedly rolling out its One UI 7 beta program for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6 in South Korea, India, and the U.S.</li><li>The devices are receiving the program ranging from 4GB to 5GB in download size as it packs many of the AI enhancements and changes the S24 received.</li><li>Samsung stated this week the programs would begin for its foldable; however, we're still waiting on the Galaxy S23 series and its tablets.</li><li>One UI 7's stable rollout is expected in April.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As mentioned earlier this week, Samsung's promised beta program start for its recent foldable duo is kicking off.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung is currently rolling out One UI 7 Beta 1 to the Galaxy Z Flip 6. The publication states the foldable (if enrolled in the program) will download/install version F741NKSU2ZYBJ. The program arrives with a payload size of 4GB for the clamshell. Curiously, the update was initially spotted arriving for South Korean users today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The program is expected to begin in other regions, as well, like the U.S., but it might take a little time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the publication <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-one-ui-7-beta-update-released/">clocked the arrival</a> of the program for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Unlike its clamshell duo, the Fold 6's program has supposedly arrived for U.S. users alongside India. The post states the versions are F956U1UEU2ZYBJ<strong> </strong>and F956BXXU2ZYBJ, respectively, at a 5GB download with the March 2025 security patch.</p>

<p>With Samsung doubling down heavily on Galaxy AI, it seems plausible that the huge download sizes for the Flip 6 and Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-first-one-ui-7-beta-is-available-now-public-release-set-for-early-2025">include similar features</a> like the Galaxy S24. SamMobile was able to unearth the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-z-fold-6-flip-6-one-ui-7-beta-full-changelog/">patch notes</a> for the foldables, which include items like One UI 7's UI overhaul, the Now Bar, separated notification and Quick Panels, and more.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-set-up-use-now-bar-samsung-galaxy-phone">Now Bar</a> is a pretty major addition to the Android 15-based software, letting users gain insights via live updates, access music controls, and routines. In a way, the Now Bar is an easy gateway into Samsung's other major feature, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-set-up-and-use-now-brief-on-the-galaxy-s25">Now Brief</a>. This is an AI-powered feature for upcoming events, weather, and more that arrived on the Galaxy S25 series.</p><p>With the test underway, users should be able to gain One UI Beta Program access by heading into the Samsung Members app and signing up — once it lands in your respective region.</p><p>Galaxy users <em>without </em>a Galaxy S25 device have been waiting on One UI 7 for a while, and Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently announced</a> it would arrive in April officially. Before that, the company teased the beta program coming to several other devices, like the Flip 6, Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series. Regarding the foldables, the Korean OEM said those respective programs would begin "this week" and it's seemingly making good on that promise.</p><p>For the others, the company's post didn't state when we could see them. However, those beta programs are expected to kick off randomly throughout March. There were also more hints that Samsung could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-ai-subscription-is-no-different-than-what-apple-and-google-are-already-doing">start charging</a> for its AI.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google's advantage in the AI race is that it can integrate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> into its existing products and services, and the company looks to be doing just that with new and upcoming features. First, there's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">AI Mode for Google Search</a>, which is our first look at how search engines will change thanks to AI. It turns out Google is also working on the reverse — using a user's Google Search history to personalize Gemini's AI responses. That's what Google will do with "Gemini Personalization model," as revealed by Android Authority.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/gemini-personalization-model-apk-3533029/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> discovered the unannounced model, which appears to be functional, in version 16.8.31 of the Google app beta. The beta adds a new model, listed as Gemini Personalization. This "experimental" model is described as offering "help based on your Search history." If you choose to connect your Google Search history to Gemini, you'll be able to get more personalized responses to your queries,</p><p>"This version of Gemini uses your Google Search history to give you personalized help," the prompt explains. "In order to use it, you'll need to first connect Gemini to your Search history. You can always disconnect it later."</p>

<p>Google notes that a user's search history will only be used to influence the Gemini Personalization model, and not any other models. Additionally, the company says that chats using the Personalize model won't be used to train and improve Gemini. It will be saved in Gemini Apps and Activity, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-remove-your-activity-from-gemini">will be deleted after 60 days</a>.</p><p>To use the Gemini Personalization model, you must turn on Web and App Activity in Gemini settings.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:108.92%;"><img id="L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg" name="Gemini-Personalization-Demo" alt="Gemini's personalization mode in a Google app beta." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L2XWJzm2ct6t3SzEHXLKSg.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="1294" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Android Authority's initial tests found that Gemini Personalization was able to accurately call upon a user's Google Search history to respond to queries. Searches dating back to January 2025 were surfaced by Gemini Personalization. The model notes that "some Gemini features are not available in this version."</p><p>Being that the Personalization model is functional in the Google app beta, it's possible that this feature launches soon. It could start off as a Gemini Advanced feature for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One AI Premium users</a> only. Google hasn't publicly announced this feature yet.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-72">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Google’s AI Mode is replacing classic search results, starting with Google One AI Premium subscribers.</li><li>AI Mode lets you ask layered questions, follow up, and dig deeper—all within Google Search.</li><li>A new 'AI Mode' button sits in the filter carousel on the left for quick activation.</li><li>On mobile, AI Mode has a dedicated button under the Search bar next to Google Lens and Sound Search.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google’s AI Mode, its ChatGPT-style search, is now <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">swapping out traditional results for a chatbot-style experience</a>, at least for paid users.</p><p>Signing up for the Search Labs waitlist is open to everyone, but paid subscribers are getting first dibs on access. If you’re in, you’ll get an email letting you know when it’s your turn to try it out.</p><p>This new feature takes searching up a notch, letting you dive deep with complex, layered questions and follow-up threads all right in Google Search.</p><p>Building on Google's AI Overview system, AI Mode uses a customized version of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.0</a> to tackle complex questions. With advanced reasoning, analysis, and multimodal capabilities, it's great for deep dives and cross-referencing information.</p><p>AI Mode is just a click away thanks to a new 'AI Mode' button in the filter carousel on the left side of any search.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1856px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:116.38%;"><img id="5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB" name="Google-Search-AI-Mode" alt="AI Mode in Google Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5pAwcf7fJnPDoE2VHAhAiB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1856" height="2160" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On mobile, AI Mode gets its own button right under the Search bar in the Home tab, alongside Google Lens and Sound Search.</p><p>A sleek visual upgrade is the text cursor, which cycles through Google's signature four colors, as noted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-ai-mode-early-access/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This dynamic design, found on both Android and iOS, is paired with vibrant blue, red, yellow, and green animations, especially during voice input and search results.</p><p>One big change is how your search query now sits at the very top of the page, without the usual floating search bar. As for sources, mobile shows them in a carousel at the top and bottom of the screen, while desktop tucks them into a card on the right side.</p><p>Just like with any research, it’s smart to fact-check info from AI sources. AI is great for pulling things together quickly, but it’s not foolproof and can mess up facts or show bias.</p><p>Currently, AI Mode is pretty basic. While it handles text and voice input (on mobile), it only spits out text. However, Google promises future upgrades, including image and video responses, better formatting, and more direct links to relevant content.</p><p>AI Mode is rolling out first to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> AI Premium subscribers. The plan comes with a free month to try it out, then costs $20 a month. Along with AI Mode, you get 2TB of storage and early access to upgraded Google AI tools.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13 was spotted receiving a new update early this morning in the U.S.</li><li>The update is roughly 1.3GB with camera improvements focused in the "tone" capabilities of the OnePlus 13's rear cameras.</li><li>There are rumors that OnePlus is developing a "mini" version of its latest flagship with a massive battery.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>There appears to be an update slowly rolling out for the latest OnePlus flagship phone today (Mar. 7).</p><p>The update's appearance was spotted by Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich on a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> earlier this morning. The patch is marked as version CPH2655_15.0.0.602(EX01) on the flagship with a 1.26GB download size. While the download is sizeable, OnePlus' patch notes don't highlight numerous changes.</p><p>The core of this OxygenOS patch concerns the camera system for the OnePlus 13. The company says it's rolling in a fix to "improve the focus capability of the rear cameras." Additionally, the update works to refine the "tone and color" capabilities when users take photos with the rear camera array.</p><p>Lastly, the changelog notes system "stability and performance" improvements, though it lacks to state what these are — which is pretty standard.</p><p>OnePlus adds the patch contains the February 2025 security patch with this download. It's worth mentioning that OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.oneplus.com/thread/1805228920841175049">updated its thread</a> on its community forum regarding this update extremely early this morning.</p><p>The company drew attention to users in North America receiving this update. It's likely just beginning to make its rounds, so users should keep their eyes open for it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH" name="OnePlus 13 vs. OnePlus 13R" alt="OnePlus 13 next to OnePlus 13R" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/st5WTVtRvtoaJ9J9MXRRZH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is the second time a OnePlus 13 patch has focused on the "tone" of photos with its rear cameras. An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-second-firmware-update-ai-fixes-detailed">update from January</a> not only tried to enhance the stability of its cameras, but also its "tone" capturing capabilities. That update at the beginning of the year came swiftly after the device's very first post-launch. OnePlus was fixing some lingering issues plaguing users while also delivering on some AI promises.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 received a face-to-face AI translation feature, which lets users see what another person is saying in split-view. The update brought the feature to "select" headphones, as well.</p><p>Early January held its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/oneplus-13-gets-gemini-nano-and-oneplus-13r-receives-new-updates">first post-launch update</a> with the inclusion of Google's Gemini Nano integration and generative AI in Messages.</p><p>In other news, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-mini-large-battery-compact-phone-rumors">there are rumors</a> that OnePlus is working on a "13 Mini" with a 6,000mAh battery. Allegedly, the Chinese OEM will work to keep the device extremely thin even with such a huge battery capacity. It gets us thinking the phone could sport the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-introduces-new-glacier-battery-featuring-6100mah">Glacier battery tech</a> as the flagship 13 — if these rumors are true, of course.</p>

<ul><li>Samsung's Galaxy S25 Edge is expected to cost around the same price as the current Galaxy S25 Plus.</li><li>A leak also predicts that the upcoming ultra-thin flagship will weigh 162 grams.</li><li>A poll on X (formerly Twitter) suggests that customers might choose other Galaxy S25 models over the Galaxy S25 Edge at the same price.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung's ultra-thin flagship, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a>, is expected to launch soon — perhaps as early as next month. While the company has shown off the design of the Galaxy S25 Edge, a lot of other details are unknown. However, we now have an idea of how much the Galaxy S25 Edge will cost and weigh, thanks to a leak from tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1897974549045821635?t=Ds2jpGnWAIx2s8DDJf2RXQ&s=19" target="_blank">Ice Universe on X (formerly Twitter)</a>.</p><p>Ice Universe says that the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge will be "similar to that of S25 Plus." That aligns with what past rumors have stated, and suggests that Samsung's slim phone will cost around $1,000. The Galaxy S25 Plus retails for $1,000 for the 256GB variant, and that doesn't account for any trade-in deals or offers. Samsung is also still running a promotion that gives you the 512GB configuration, priced at $1,200, for the price of the base model.</p><p>With that in mind, it's likely that the Galaxy S25 Edge price is somewhere in between the base-model Galaxy S25 and the premium Galaxy S25 Plus. If the price is similar between these two phones, which one would you buy? That's what Ice Universe asked in a poll on X, and over 3,300 people voted at the time of publishing this article.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The weight of Galaxy S25 edge is confirmed, 162g, 5.84mm thick, and the price is similar to that of S25+. ​​​
If the price is similar, which would you choose, S25+ or S25 edge?<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1897974549045821635">March 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The verdict? Fifty-three percent of people chose the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</a>, while just under 47% chose the Galaxy S25 Edge. It's a small sample size, but this poll suggests the Galaxy S25 Edge could be a niche offering — especially at its high price point.</p><p>The other specs of the Galaxy S25 Edge are impressive. The slim phone is rumored to weigh 162 grams and measure 5.84mm thick, according to the latest leaks. Previous rumors predicted that the Galaxy S25 Edge could be lighter, but those appear to be outdated now.

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you don't mind going for an entry-level phone, and would appreciate an extra $25 off; you're looking for a phone with a decently sized AMOLED screen; having a smartphone with a large battery and/or a 25W charging speed is a priority for you.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance; you want a smartphone with more than 4GB of RAM.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-a16-5g-comes-to-the-us-with-a-bigger-screen-and-longer-software-support">Samsung launched the affordable Galaxy A16 5G in January</a>, and retailers are already offering early discounts on the smartphone.

<ul><li>Honor is seemingly preparing to launch its next foldable, the Honor Magic V4, around June 2025.</li><li>The Honor Magic V4 is tipped to get even thinner, with a thickness under 9mm when folded.</li><li>Honor's upcoming foldable is also expected to have an impressive camera system with a 200MP telephoto camera.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor could be gearing up to release its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">next foldable</a>, the Honor Magic V4, and the phone's specs have apparently leaked. Known leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5141223314293756" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> revealed many details about the device in a post, including its thickness, screen size, and camera sensors (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/honor_magic_v4_leaked_specs_are_insane_oppo_find_n5_to_get_a_true_competitor-news-66836.php" target="_blank">GSMArena</a>). Being that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a> recently launched to critical acclaim, and is likely to compete directly with the Magic V4, the just-leaked specifications indicate that Honor might bring a real challenger to Oppo.</p><p>For starters, the Honor Magic V4 is tipped to measure less than 9mm when folded and bring an IPX8 water-resistance rating. That'll likely be just as thin as the Oppo Find N5, which measures 8.93mm when folded. However, the Find N5 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">has an IPX9 rating</a>, and that's better than the rumored Magic V4's durability.</p><p>The leak also confirms that the Magic V4 will be powered by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a>, just like the regular Honor Magic 7 Pro and the Oppo Find N5. It's unclear whether it'll use the foldable version of the chip — the same seven-core variant that the Find N5 also uses — or the fully-featured version in the Magic 7 Pro.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ" name="honor-magic-v3-review-17.jpg" alt="Honor Magic V3 tent mode against table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GNWYaFmXNDkbMpCCdFLsxJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Foldable phones have always come with camera compromises, but Honor might be trying to break that trend with the Magic V4. The main camera is said to be a 50MP lens with a 1/1.5-inch sensor size. Meanwhile, that's paired with a 200MP telephoto lens with a 1/1.4-inch sensor size and 3x optical zoom support. We don't yet know if that could be paired with another camera, but since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review">Magic V3</a> used a triple-camera setup, it's likely.</p><p>Finally, the report indicates that the Honor Magic V4 will be equipped with an 8-inch main screen and a 6.45-inch cover screen. Wireless charging and satellite connectivity will be available, too.</p><p>Current predictions expect the Honor Magic V4 to launch around June 2025, and leaks should come more frequently as that timeframe gets closer. It's possible that the Magic V4 launches in China before Europe, as is typically the case with Honor launches.</p>

That's a good thing in countries like India, where a mobile phone is often the only screen available. So any headway that can be made to make gaming better — or just about any other use case on mobile — has tangible gains.</p>

<p>That's why I was excited to talk to Arm's senior director of smartphone segment strategy, Steve Raphael, to know about the brand's plans relating to mobile gaming and AI innovations. Raphael talked about Arm's mission to bring "console-quality" gaming to mobile, and that it has an "amazing roadmap" of announcements in this area. <br><br>Raphael talked about technologies that have made a real difference in the world of Windows gaming — DLSS or FSR — and bringing something similar to mobile devices. Arm introduced Accuracy Super Resolution (ASR) nine months ago, but it started demoing the tech in action at MWC 2025, and is slated to serve up additional details at GDC 2025 in a few weeks' time. <br><br>Similar to NVIDIA's DLSS, ASR uses temporal upscaling to deliver significantly better visual fidelity. Essentially, the tech renders a scene at a lower resolution, and uses AI models to upscale to a higher resolution, leading to smoother framerates and better clarity. Arm showcased a demo running on a device powered by the Immortalis-G925 that was connected to a tablet, and while there was some artifacting, it was smooth, and the overall visual quality was terrific. <br><br>The tech can deliver gains of up to 53%, and I see it making a difference in budget and mid-range chipsets, where there's a need for this kind of a feature. Arm isn't starting from scratch, instead leveraging AMD's open-source FSR2 upscaler as the foundation — this is absolutely the right move, as it allows Arm a decent head-start.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x-NuqCFGGTY" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>Upscaling makes sense on mobile as there's a limited power budget on the device, and any shortcut you can take to increase framerates without overheating or needlessly throttling is a huge bonus. And as this is being baked in at the platform level, all devices that are powered by Arm hardware — basically every Android phone — stand to benefit. <br><br>I shifted gears to talking about AI and mobile NPUs, and Raphael stated that Arm did a "tremendous amount of work" this year to make it easy to load AI applications into the CPU, integrating numerous libraries and optimizing usability so they're effortless to get started.</p><p>On that note, Arm teamed up with Stability AI to bring generative audio to phones, and it showcased the tech in action at MWC 2025. The brand is going to debut image, video, and 3D generation tools on its devices in the coming months. Most AI use cases on mobile are cloud-driven, but it isn't sustainable to send swathes of data to a cloud server to get the requisite information; Raphael talked about this "asymmetry" where considerable energy is used to send data to a cloud server, and how it ends up being a "huge burden." <br><br>Balancing efficiency with performance is going to be pivotal with these AI workloads, and Raphael mentioned how the brand made "phenomenal amounts of efficiency gains" in the last two years, and that Arm is looking to deliver more AI use cases on-device instead of information going to the cloud.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="raKeF2zCnULWMkURqUTdMP" name="arm-mwc-25-1" alt="Arm audio generator running Stability AI on-device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/raKeF2zCnULWMkURqUTdMP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I also asked about the recent trend with mobile platforms where manufacturers like MediaTek and Qualcomm are leveraging big cores exclusively in their products instead of the heterogenous configurations we've seen in years past. Raphael said that it is driven by a need for Arm's partners to deliver the best possible performance, and that although designs like the Dimensity 9400 exclusively use Cortex X925, X725, and A720, the inherent gains with the latest v9 core means they deliver much better efficiency than their predecessors. <br><br>Raphael also mentioned a key point about the frequencies at play, noting that although cores now go up to over 4GHz, the time that they're actually running at that frequency is minuscule, often measured in milliseconds. The idea is to execute a task as fast as possible — such as an app launch — and go back to idle state to maximize efficiency, and this is what makes devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> last at least a day and a half even though it is made up entirely of powerful cores. <br><br>Lastly, I talked about Arm's licensing model and whether we'll see any changes on that front. Raphael stated emphatically that Arm's current model is its "bread and butter," and as it stands to benefit by sharing in a brand's success via royalties, it doesn't see the need to alter the status quo. I asked about the situation with Qualcomm and whether that was resolved, but predictably, I didn't get a comment either way. <br><br>Having used NVIDIA's DLSS extensively in the last four years, I'm excited to see how Arm can leverage ASR on mobile devices. The demos it showcased are promising, and the fact that this is agnostic of device maker or chip vendor means all Android devices can take advantage of the tech, and that's a great thing.</p>

<hr>
<p>Honor has been in the news lately for jumping on the AI train(better late than never) and launching its AI strategy at the MWC this week. Calling it the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Honor Alpha Plan</a>, the company plans to integrate it into its current and upcoming devices. (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/honor-mini-flagship-slim-phone-rumors/">via 9to5Google</a>)</p><p>The company wants to integrate the Alpha Plan in a three-step strategy, that focuses on intelligent phones, AI ecosystem, and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence).</p><p>Additionally, it looks like the company is trying to stay relevant and get on the slim device trend as well. In a recent leak that surfaced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5140777514045884">Weibo</a>, a tipster claims that the company is working on a "small screen" flagship device, which Digital Chat Station states will also be ultra-thin.</p><p>The tipster added that the phone would measure about 6.3 inches and would be called "Yaozi" —which according to the tipster is a Chinese word for "glory." Digital Chat Station also added that a new folder has been created, indicating that the company has just begun working on this phone and is in the initial development stages.</p><p>While 6.3 inches isn't small, it could still measure less than their most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-7-pro-camera-review">Honor Magic 7 Pro</a>. While we don't have much information about the above slim phone, it would be nice to see some more specs of this alleged phone, to back the tipster's claims.</p><p>That said,  several major OEMs are chasing the ultra-slim phone dream— which seems like a growing trend in the industry. While Samsung showed off its Galaxy S25 Edge at the MWC, another ultra-thin phone by Techno, measuring 5.75mm was spotted by Harish Jonnalagadda at the tech conference.</p><p>Stealing Samsung's thunder is the razor-thin <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Techno Spark Slim</a>, which is currently the world's slimmest phone, and if Honor is working on its version in the same category, it would be interesting to see how "slim" is Ultra slim for this OEM, that could come with Honor's new Alpha AI.</p>

That's where this list comes in, as Android Central's Derrek Lee and Harish Jonnalagadda list out some of the coolest (and weirdest) devices at MWC 2025.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-tecno-s-very-thin-phone"><span>TECNO's very thin phone</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yTJb3c9fB5kM5gV2QpoTT4" name="Tecno Spark Slim" alt="Tecno Spark Slim hands-on at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTJb3c9fB5kM5gV2QpoTT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/hands-on-worlds-thinnest-phone-tecno-spark-slim-mwc-2025">Spark Slim</a> is one of the most impressive devices at the show. Not only does it have an incredibly sleek design, but the phone measures just 5.75mm in thickness. What's amazing about this is that TECNO managed to squeeze a fairly large 5,200mAh battery into the phone, which is larger than the battery powering the rather massive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>The design looks like a futuristic Nexus, with a camera bar spanning the top of the phone and LEDs and unibody ceramic or stainless steel rear panels, both of which look better than most phones on the market today. For now, the phone is just a concept, but with the renewed interest in thin phones this year, we hope it arrives sooner rather than later.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-display-s-claw-like-foldable"><span>Samsung Display's claw-like foldable</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6snAS3CfJTptXepvTZSzkK" name="Samsung-Display-Asymmetric-Flip" alt="Samsung Display's Asymmetric Flip closed and showing a notification" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6snAS3CfJTptXepvTZSzkK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So-called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">tri-fold</a>" phones are slowly becoming a thing, but this device does things a little differently. Instead of a large phone opening to a tablet-sized device, this Samsung Display concept takes the flip form factor and flips the script... again. Instead of folding two halves together, this phone folds in two separate sections, which closes the phone like you would close your fist.</p><p>Even more unique is the fact that it leaves a section of the display visible when the phone is closed, allowing the user to view notifications or the like from the small sliver of the screen. It's by far one of the weirdest designs we've seen.</p>

<p>Realme showcased the Ultra at MWC 2025, and the main highlight of the device is that it has a 1-inch sensor — much like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> and other Chinese rivals. However, unlike all of those phones, Realme managed to add a mount to the back of the Ultra, allowing you to attach standard camera lenses to the phone. It is a neat idea, and Realme had a 10x lens that allowed the device to take lossless images at that zoom factor. As you'd imagine, the camera lens is absolutely massive, but it is usable — more so than I initially imagined.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="cwEgumvxF7NwJ3oSwTThjW" name="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens" alt="Realme Interchangeable Mobile Lens demo at MWC 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwEgumvxF7NwJ3oSwTThjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Obviously, this isn't a retail product yet, but Realme has indicated that it will start selling a variant of the phone to consumers at some point. The lens that Realme showcased had a custom mount, but if the brand is able to deliver a retail device that works with standard Sony, Canon, or Nikon lens mounts, it would make the phone so much more versatile as a camera package.</p>

<p>Xiaomi also tried its hand at attaching a lens to the back of its phone — in this case, a custom Xiaomi 15 — and unlike Realme, it bolted on magnetic ring with pogo pins to the back of the device to facilitate the lens. The result is a cleaner look, and you can use the main cameras in addition to the lens attachment. The lens itself is considerably shorter than most traditional DSLR lenses, and the 35mm focal length is ideal for shooting in day-to-day scenarios.</p>

<p>Xiaomi says the pogo pins make it near-instantaneous to transfer imagery data to the device, and I like the idea of being able to attach lenses to the back of an existing phone. Xiaomi didn't say if it would put this idea into production, but it is possible we may see something along these lines on the next Ultra device.</p>

<p>Samsung knows how to make standout foldable OLED panels, and at MWC, Samsung Display showcased what's on the horizon. The star attraction is a handheld console with a foldable panel; it bends in the middle similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 6, and it is an undoubtedly cool idea. The demo unit was just to highlight the panel, so it wasn't a full-fledged console as such, but I'm excited to see one of the many handheld brands try to leverage this design — I would love to use a foldable Steam Deck.</p>

<p>Samsung also highlighted its Flex G and Flex S designs; these are foldable panels aimed at tri-folding and multi-folding devices, and while it is unlikely we'll see Samsung release phones that use these OLED panels anytime soon, it's great to see that the tech itself is available.</p>

<p>I'm thoroughly enjoying using my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">Huawei Mate XT</a>, and the tri-folding device is holding up much better than I imagined. Tecno demoed its own tri-folding device at MWC, and it is pretty great in its own right. While it isn't as sleek as the Mate XT, it has a usable tri-folding design, and it also extends to a tablet-sized panel.</p>
<p>Tecno didn't detail much about the device, but the one advantage it has over the Mate XT is that it has Google's Play Store and associated mobile services installed out of the box. Like the Tecno Spark Slim, the brand doesn't have any plans to introduce this device as a retail offering at this moment in time, but I want that to change.</p>

<p>Mudra Link is a unique gesture control wristband that leverages neural signals to drive interactions. It connects via Bluetooth, and in the MWC 2025 demo, it was paired to a Mac Mini and was able to control the volume and play a virtual violin instrument. There's also a Mudra Band that can be used with the Apple Watch, giving you the ability to control the Apple TV from your wrist. Mudra says it's working with XR device manufacturers to integrate the Link with their devices, and that sounds interesting to say the least.</p>

<p>Infinix had one of the coolest demos at MWC 2025, with its E-Color Shift 2.0 phone featuring a color E Ink panel at the back that changes colors dynamically. There's the option to change colors to custom patterns or designs, and you can also tweak the back colors to reflect the weather, your mood, or even an emoji. It did a great job changing colors on the fly, and the use of E Ink at the back to do so is a novel idea.</p>
<p>Infinix says it is mulling debuting a phone with similar tech, but there are no plans to bring this particular device to market. Even then, I'm positive another brand will see what Infinix did here and will try to leverage the same idea in its own device.</p>

<p>As an honoree for best AI innovation at MWC, Honor is doing a very interesting thing with its AI. The company had a robotic hand on display that onlookers could interact with. Paxini includes a camera that can view your hand and then replicate your movements. A computer was set up to stream the feed from Paxini so you can see how it's analyzing your hand's movements. It wasn't immediately clear what Honor planned to do with the hand, but there's no doubt there could be plenty of uses for something like this.</p>

ZTE says the Focus 2 Ultra has a 108MP primary camera and five focal lengths. With the zoom ring, users can close in on a subject up to 10x, and you even get a camera button to complete the package, making this the ultimate camera phone.</p>

It appears to be much more secure than what's available on phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">Google Pixel</a> and is even smart enough not to be fooled by masks or even a 3D printout of someone's face.</p><p>Polar ID is supported on flagship Snapdragon chips, and the company is talking to OEMs now, so hopefully, we'll be seeing this tech on our next smartphones.</p>

<p>RayNeo is doing all the right things in the XR category, and the X3 Pro is definitely interesting. The AR glasses use a micro-LED light engine and go up to 2500 nits, and there's a camera at the front that lets you record photos and videos. The best feature is the built-in AI translation; it translates conversations in real-time, and it did an effective job in the demo that RayNeo set up on the convention floor. The glasses are coming out in the latter half of the year, and I can't wait to get my hands on the product.</p>

<p>Foldables phones have become mainstream these days, but that isn't the case with notebooks. Well, Lenovo is aiming to change that with the ThinkBook Flip, a device that has an absurd 18.1-inch panel that folds outwards. Other than the fact that the panel folding outwards means there's always a section that's prone to damage should it take a tumble, I don't really see how the extra-tall width makes sense on a notebook. This is just a demo at this point, and it's unlikely Lenovo will introduce a consumer model anytime soon.</p>

<p>Etisalat is the UAE's biggest carrier, and it now goes by the name e&. Anyway, it had a humanoid robot at its booth made by the U.K.'s Engineering Arts, and it was pretty convincing. Called Amira, the robot mimics facial cues easily, and it uses AI to converse. Engineering Arts noted that the robot on the show floor was controlled by a human to answer queries — we were told that is the only reliable way to make any sense of dozens of attendings shouting questions at once — so we don't have to be too worried about the robot apocalypse.</p>

<ul><li>Widgets will arrive on the lock screen for Android phones and tablets later this year with Android 16 QPR1.</li><li>Google brought lock screen widgets to the Pixel Tablet with Android 15, and the feature will be available as part of the AOSP in "late Summer 2025."</li><li>While the update will be available for OEMs to implement, device manufactures won't be able to customize the experience.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Lock Screen widgets are a crucial part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/google-pixel-tablet-review">Google Pixel Tablet</a> experience, and they're coming to all Android phones later this year. Google announced the move in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/03/widgets-on-lock-screen-faq.html" target="_blank">blog post</a> on the Android Developers Blog today, March 6. The update will be pushed to the Android Open Source Project in "late Summer 2025" and "all widgets are compatible with the lock screen widget experience," according to the company.</p><p>"Lock screen widgets will be available in AOSP for tablets and mobile starting with the release after Android 16 (QPR1)," the company says in the post. Pixel phones might get lock screen widgets first, as the blog post notes "other device manufacturers may update their devices as well once the feature is available in AOSP."</p><p>The update coming as part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> QPR1 will not only boost the capabilities of Android phones, but could also third-party Android tablets, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-2-review">OnePlus Pad</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Tab lineup</a>. However, it's up to those third-party OEMs to implement the functionality when it becomes available. Notably, Google says device manufacturers can't customize the appearance of lock screen widgets, so it's possible some OEMs might opt not to include this feature.</p><p>"All lock screen widgets will have the same developer experience on all devices," the company adds.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uJDp3PYcTYEc2ruefbfFLJ" name="google-pixel-tablet-review-vertical-2.jpg" alt="Google Pixel Tablet in vertical mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uJDp3PYcTYEc2ruefbfFLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google also provides insight on how widgets might appear on the lock screen in the form of developer instructions. "For the best experience, please make sure your widget supports dynamic color and dynamic resizing," the post explains. "Lock screen widgets are sized to approximately 4 cells wide by 3 cells tall on the launcher, but exact dimensions vary by device."</p><p>Lock screen widgets, when available, could give users more ways to easily take actions within apps with fewer taps. Android 16 is set to bring multiple new experiences to the lock screen, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-gives-us-a-sneak-peek-at-live-updates">Live Updates are also expected to arrive</a> as part of the update.</p>

<ul><li>Google’s Head of Android said the tech giant is on track to release Android 16 in June, due to the new ‘Trunk Stable’ development process.</li><li>The tech giant plans to highlight a few features from this update for users early on.</li><li>However, with major OS drops, the company is still deciding if they want to release all the new features in one go or do it as quarterly Android updates.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android 16 is the next big thing for Google other than releasing its yearly devices and this time it's doing things differently. Major software rollouts are usually accompanied by the company’s flagship model (Pixel 10 this year) in August every year; however, Google is on track to give us <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> earlier in June, with the company’s President of Android ecosystem, Sameer Samat, confirming the same at MWC (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/android-16-is-on-track-for-june/">Android Police</a>).</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Samat said, “So far, so good. I've never had a release where at this point the bug count was where I wanted it to be, but the team is working really hard, and we're excited about getting it there.”</p><p>The tech giant has set this early goal for itself and according to the company, this is due to the recent changes within the Android team. This happened late last year when Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai announced the merger of the software and hardware teams, bringing the Platforms and Devices team under one roof. We assume that this could have brought a shift in key goals, which accelerated the company’s software rollout.</p><p>Speaking further to the publication, Samat mentioned that the team is now in something called the “Trunk Stable” stage— this essentially means that all developers working on the software are contributing their efforts to a single shared branch of code. In contrast to what would happen earlier, where developers would work separately on different branches and merge closer to the release. This would allow for the teams to perform several tests on the software to look for bugs and defects — allowing for an early release.</p>

<p>“One of the reasons for the original release schedule is we would do that merge in June. Then it would take us from June until later in the year to work out all of those issues. And so one of the challenges we set ourselves internally is to see if we can get this out earlier,” Samat added.</p><p>The Android head added that the company will be doing more to highlight what this major software update would bring to devices, possibly hinting at showing off some features before launch.</p><p>"When we have new capabilities, the decision is always between do we hold this for an operating system release  or do we give it to people on a more quarterly cadence with Android drops."</p>

<p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">recent rumor was floating</a> around that Samsung will not be releasing incremental updates like "One UI 7.1" or "One UI 7.1.1." but it will jump right ahead to the One UI 8, considering Google’s Android 16 early release.</p><p>The Korean OEM’s One UI 7 is delayed until April and tipster Ice Universe thinks the company won't be bringing any more updates to this version of the software. Considering they might have to jump right ahead to the next one, with Google all set to release Android 16 earlier.</p><p>However, this claim doesn’t have any backing, but with the way Samsung is treating its current software rollout, it is highly unlikely it will jump to the next one as early as June.</p>

<ul><li>Google is moving the Project Gemini team from the Google DeepMind group to the Gemini app umbrella.</li><li>The Gemini app now has a new VP, as ex-Meta VP Chris Struhar will lead the group.</li><li>Project Astra is set to launch for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel phones later this month.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Project Astra began as one of Google's more ambitious research projects when it was teased at Google I/O 2024 last year. Android Central tried it as part of a large demo setup, and the plan was always to scale that down to be able to run on Google Pixel phones. More recently, Project Astra has progressed, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/geminis-project-astra-could-land-on-your-phones-this-month">Google is now planning to release it</a> for Gemini Advanced subscribers on Pixel phones this month.</p><p>Ahead of that move, Google is making a few organizational changes for Project Astra, as announced internally today, March 6, and reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/gemini-astra-team/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. The team working on Project Astra will now be part of the larger Gemini app team, as Project Astra will soon be part of the multimodal Gemini Live. Previously, the group working on Project Astra was organized under Google DeepMind, the company's research sector working on Astra and other projects, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>.</p><p>While 9to5Google reports some parts of the Project Astra team will remain with DeepMind, the bulk of the Astra group will now be organized under the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> app team. Additionally, the team has a new head, as Chris Struhar is now the Vice President of Product for the Gemini app.</p><p>The company announced the ex-Meta VP will lead the Gemini app in a corresponding move today. Struhar will be reporting to VP and General Manager Sissie Hsiao, who leads everything Gemini and Google Assistant related.</p>

<p>When it releases later this month, Astra will add new multimodal capabilities to Gemini Live. Users will be able to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-updates-gemini-live-plans-screen-sharing-and-live-video-support">share their live video feed and share their screen</a>  to get more personalized responses in real time from Gemini Live.</p><p>The next steps for Project Astra will be getting it to run on wearable hardware, including AR and VR applications. Google asked for "trusted testers" to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-astra-ar-waitlist-opens-trusted-testers">join a Project Astra waitlist</a> to test this kind of functionality at the end of last year.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-112">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>Android 16 Beta 2.1 is a subtle update that includes working Live Updates for Google Maps.</li><li>Users can track their navigation progress in the status bar, notification panel, and on the lock screen with Live Updates.</li><li>The feature isn't fully working as of yet, since Live Updates appear collapsed with the always-on display in use.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google released the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-1-is-here-to-fix-a-set-of-annoying-bugs">Android 16 Beta 2.1 update last week</a>, and it was originally thought to be a minor patch. The update included fixes for a few annoying bugs, including one that forced Pixel phones to restart without warning. However, Android expert Mishaal Rahman over at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-maps-live-updates-3532808/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> has discovered that Android 16 Beta 2.1 adds support for Live Updates in Google Maps.</p><p>Live Updates are coming to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, and they're like Live Activities on iPhones. These are time-sensitive notifications that can remain in various places on your Android phone to provide glanceable updates, like the status of your rideshare or the progress of your Google Maps journey. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-live-updates-chip-notification-panel-demo">previewed Live Updates in a beta test demo last month</a>, but Android 16 Beta 2.1 is the first time we've seen them working with a real app.</p><p>As noted by Rahman, Live Updates for Google Maps only works properly in a few locations in Android 16 Beta 2.1. Live Updates are intended to appear in multiple locations, including the notification panel, lock screen, always-on display, and status bar. Android Authority noticed Live Updates from Google Maps appearing in the status bar, lock screen, and notification panel, but support for always-on displays appears to be incomplete.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1046px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.56%;"><img id="LFqt25rMFR7kbDR3ySqsaf" name="Live-Updates-Maps" alt="Live Updates in Android 16 Beta 2.1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LFqt25rMFR7kbDR3ySqsaf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1046" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Per the report, Google Maps' Live Updates appeared in collapsed views on the always-on display in Android Beta 2.1. Meanwhile, Google's beta preview of Live Updates saw the feature working fully with an expanded view on the always-on display. It's possible that Google is still working on this functionality, or that it's limited to certain apps.</p><p>Due to size limitations, the Live Updates for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-maps">Google Maps</a> in the status bar are extremely limited. The tiny and green pill-shaped Live Update in the status bar for Google Maps merely showed the time until you've reached your destination. More information was available on the lock screen or notification panel.</p><p>Live Updates are expected to become available with Android 16 when it debuts later this year. It's possible we could see expanded functionality for Live Updates as the Android Beta Program continues.</p>

<ul><li>Surprising rumors claim Samsung is interested in rolling out its Android 16-based software, One UI 8, much earlier this year.</li><li>A tipster on X states the company "will not" do incremental updates like "One UI 7.1" or a "One UI 7.1.1."</li><li>One UI 7 has been met with incredible delays since the fall of 2024; however, Samsung states it should rollout officially in April.</li><li>Android 16 is also expected to debut much earlier this year from Google, perhaps in Q2 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Don't think anyone had this on their bingo card; rumors claim Samsung's Android 16-based update could rollout soon after its (delayed) Android 15 upgrade.</p><p>The rumor was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1896420740305694943">posted on X</a> by prominent tipster IceUniverse, claiming Samsung's One UI 8 update could rollout much sooner this year (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.pocket-lint.com/one-ui-8-release-rumor/">Pocket-lint</a>). The Korean OEM <em>typically </em>launches its major Android upgrade toward the fall, sometime after Google releases it.</p><p>However, the tipster states we might see a rush order in for One UI 8 as Samsung skips the in-between updates for One UI 7.</p><p>IceUniverse states Galaxy users might not see a "One UI 7.1" or "One UI 7.1.1" this year, like we have with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-one-ui-611-is-finally-here-for-these-galaxy-phones">One UI 6 throughout 2024</a>. Unfortunately, rumors end there as the tipster doesn't purport a potential timeline for a One UI 8 (Android 16) launch for Galaxy devices.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The next version of One UI 7.0 is One UI 8.0, there is no One UI 7.1 and 7.1.1<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1896420740305694943">March 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>There's no hiding the fact that One UI 7 has been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/dreary-one-ui-7-beta-forum-update">continuously hit with delays</a> since last year. Just as Galaxy users thought they were in the clear, another one was reported in February — which then came true <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-releases-yet-another-one-ui-7-beta-update-for-the-galaxy-s24">later that month</a>. Samsung rolled out One UI 7 Beta 5 quickly after Beta 4, packed with a few bug fixes and solutions for crashes. The software was delayed (again) in February due to a display issue with a screen optimization mode.</p><p>Fast-forward to March and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">announced</a> its major One UI 7 (Android 15) update <em>should </em>arrive officially in April for eligible devices.</p><p>Things become interesting here as, according to Samsung, it will begin a beta program for the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and Fold 6, Galaxy S23 series, and Galaxy Tab S10 series in March. Hopefully, these devices won't see as many delays, especially when you factor in what rumors suggest today.</p><p>Another point to consider is Google is working to release Android 16 much quicker in 2025 than it has previously. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-2-is-here-with-new-media-camera-and-graphics-updates">Android 16 Beta 2</a> rolled out in February, which was pretty on track for Google's set schedule this year. The company is interested in launching the next software in Q2 2025, urging our eyes toward an April and June timeframe.</p><p>It seems like Samsung is trying to rush One UI 8 because of this — for competition and user postivity, no doubt. We'll have to wait and see what happens with One UI 7 first, though.</p>

<p>Civilization VII is on the way to the Meta Quest sometime this Spring, but you don't have to wait until then to play great strategy games on your Meta Quest headset. Strategy games in VR come to life like never before, giving you a new angle on the action so you can get up close and personal.</p><p>Whether it's commanding armies, building cities, directing ships to attack or mine, or even terraforming an entire planet, you'll be pleasantly surprised at the amount of high-quality strategy games already available on the Meta Quest platform. I can't wait to see Civilization like never before on my dining room table in a living board game but, until then, here's how I'm strategizing away my time.</p>

<p>Underworld Overseer sees you excavating and managing a dungeon from the perspective of the almighty Overseer, including the ability to directly pick up your units and move them around where you want. As you command your units to dig further underground, you'll unearth treasures galore and build new areas that'll attract all sorts of different creatures to your dungeon.</p><p>The game evokes memories of the hit Dungeon Keeper games from the 90s and early 2000s, something I lauded <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/underworld-overseer-is-dungeon-keeper-spiritual-sequel">when I first wrote about</a> Underworld Overseer last October. I got access to the next big update recently and it offers additional levels and challenging new enemies for free. Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014023">a PSVR 2 version</a> is coming out soon!</p>

<p>Demeo has been the go-to recommendation for turn-based strategy for years. Demeo sees players choose one of seven different heroes, each with their own unique set of skills and movement options. Players make two actions during each turn which consists of movement, attacks, or special cards in their hand. Levels are proceedurally generated and scale up to four players.</p><p>It's a brilliant multiplayer title that's managed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">sidestep the toxic nature</a> of many multiplayer games, offering up a friendly community and tons of fun. It's been so successful Resolution Games was able to deliver a PvP spinoff called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/demeo-battles-announcement">Demeo Battles</a> in 2023 and is currently working on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked-sounds-incredible">official Dungeons & Dragons VR game</a> using the Demeo engine.

<p>Little Cities proved that city building doesn't need to only be for the hardcore stat nerds that love games like SimCity and Cities. That's not to say that these folks won't <em>also</em> enjoy Little Cities, but the game isn't designed to keep you in your headset for hours at a time, just little sessions here and there as you desire.</p><p>Each session begins with an empty island that you'll need to zone for and build on to create the mini city of your dreams. A little $6.99 DLC package introduces snowy islands that bring winter coziness to this already cozy game, and hand tracking support means you don't even have to grab your controllers to have fun. If you do want more detailed city building, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/cities-vr/4046879905345967/">Cities VR</a> is actually a game on the Quest, too.</p>

<p>Sick of building on Earth? <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-took-elon-musks-advice-and-nuked-mars-in-this-amazing-quest-game">Per Aspera VR</a> will take you to the red planet to terraform and colonize its harsh landscape into something a lot more livable for humans. It's more stat-heavy than Little Cities but I didn't get overwhelmed by it at all. In fact, I had an easier time playing this one in VR because of the VR-centric controls and the ability to feel more "aware" of the planet, as a whole.</p><p>Aside from great gameplay, the game's story is intriguing and well voice-acted. You'll begin the game playing as AMI, an artificial intelligence (or maybe not so artificial since it's <em>you</em>) that has been tasked with getting the planet ready for the first humans, scheduled to arrive in a few short years. A DLC even brings about life in Mars after terraforming is done, dealing with the myriad of problems that come about with a flourishing planet.</p>

<p>If you're sick of city building and just want to get out into space, these last two options will be right up your alley. Gods of Gravity launched as one of the earliest free-to-play success stories and quickly became <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/the-best-new-quest-2-game-of-2023-wont-even-cost-you-a-dime">my strategy game of the year</a> in 2023. It's a built-for-VR experience that sees you capturing planets to farm resources and build bigger squadrons, all with the goal of capturing all the home planets in a system.</p><p>The game is designed to be played multiplayer but a single-player campaign delivers all the strategy you want without a pesky story getting in the way. You'll play as one of several different gods, each with its own set of powers, that's able to physically grab any ship in the squadron and launch it like a dart. The strategy is real and the players will give you a serious challenge, especially as you make your way to the tournament rounds. This is Chess in Space and it evokes some of my favorite moments from Ender's Game's Command School.</p>

<p>Last, but certainly not least, is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="">Homeworld: Vast Reaches</a>. Yes, it's <em>that</em> Homeworld and it's in glorious VR and mixed reality for the first time ever. I grew up with the Homeworld games and always wondered what it would be like if I could be the one physically grabbing those ships and pointing them where to go with more than just a mouse and a keyboard. Now I don't have to wonder anymore! The mixed reality mode even puts ships and asteroids <em>in</em> my living room, making it feel even more unique.</p><p>Homeworld VR is an original story that takes place between Homeworld 1 and 2, helping fill in some gaps in the story. Don't worry if you've never played any game in the series, though! The excellent narration and beautifully illustrated story keeps you in the loop. The campaign can be finished in just a few hours and it's not as detailed or stat-heavy as the non-VR versions of the game, but I tend to find that this method works best in a headset.</p>

<ul><li>Shortly after releasing the March Feature Drop with new camera upgrades, Pixel Camera 9.8 is rolling out.</li><li>The small update includes a toggle that lets users disable animation in astrophotography shots.</li><li>It's rolling out now in the Google Play Store, but may take some time to show up for everyone.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google shipped a few neat Pixel Camera features with the March Feature Drop this week, and now a new update for Pixel Camera is rolling out to match. As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/05/pixel-camera-9-8/#more-664233" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, Pixel Camera 9.8 is becoming available through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.GoogleCamera" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> with a few settings menu tweaks and support for March Feature Drop updates. This is a minor update, with the bulk of the new features being attributed to the most recent Pixel Feature Drop.</p><p>The highlight of the Pixel Camera 9.8 update is a toggle for "Turn on animation for Astrophotography" in the app's settings menu. Animation was already present in astrophotography shots, and this toggle is still enabled by default. However, this is the first time Google made it possible for end users to disable them. You can find the toggle by navigating to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Advanced</strong> in Pixel Camera 9.8.</p><p>The other tweak, as noted by 9to5Google, is a change in wording for the description of the Palm Timer toggle in settings. The description now reads, "Start a photo timer by showing your palm to the front or rear cameras." Previously, it only listed compatibility with the front camera.</p>

<p>The rest of the features in Pixel Camera 9.8 were bundled with the March Feature Drop, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">which we have all the details on here</a>. They include Dual Screen Preview for video recording for Pixel Fold users, and Add Me support for Dual Screen Preview on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. Additionally, Connected Cameras allow you to use another Pixel or a GoPro as a remote camera for livestreaming and recording.</p><p>This is the latest Pixel Camera update, and it's a relatively small one. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-rolls-out-a-small-pixel-camera-9-7-patch-update">last patch update for Pixel Camera 9.7</a> was also minor, and an earlier version of Pixel Camera added Quick access settings. Before that, version 9.6 added an underwater mode, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-astrophotography-mode-google-pixel">easier astrophotography mode access</a>, and vertical panoramas.</p>

<hr>
<p>We're approaching the dreaded Daylight Savings (where we spring ahead) but, to help, Samsung is discussing a couple of new updates.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/world-sleep-day-recovering-from-daylight-saving-time-may-take-more-than-three-weeks-youngest-hit-hardest">blog post</a>, Samsung's research from 2024 showed how Daylight Savings Time (DST) affects users across varying age groups. While younger people are affected the hardest, the company says it's preparing a few updates to help all its users recoup some of that lost sleep. Samsung highlighted two major updates, beginning with "creating an ideal sleep environment."</p><p>The post announces there will be a Samsung Health app update "later this month" that brings a familiar feature: the Sleep Environment Report.</p><p>The sole purpose of this tool is to give the user "guidance" and "analysis" about where they lay their head. In short, environmental factors like the room's temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2 </sub>levels can negatively (or positively) impact your rest. All of this information is gathered by the report's integration with SmartThings. If anything is out of alignment, the Health app's report will inform you so you can make the right call.</p><p>With this en route for Galaxy phones, Samsung says not everyone will get this later in March. According to its post, the Sleep Environment Report will drop for One UI 7 devices — basically, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-and-s25-plus-hands-on">Galaxy S25 series</a> — for Health app versions 6.29.5 or higher. Since the report leverages SmartThings, the company says you must ensure your device is connected to it.</p><p>The second update concerns the Health app's Energy Score, detailing how far you can push yourself daily. Samsung says the update will provide a new metric: Activity Consistency. The company says it's designed to "help you understand your overall condition in greater detail." It will analyze your activity levels "over the past four weeks" to accomplish this.</p>

<p>The Sleep Environment Report will sound familiar if you checked out Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-is-expanding-the-galaxy-ring-in-five-important-new-ways">major Galaxy Ring announcement</a>. Not only was the smart ring available in a few new sizes, but it also grabbed a couple of new Health app features, one of which was its sleep time guidance report. The feature works similarly to what Samsung is preparing to drop for its Galaxy phones later in March. The report offers insight into your sleeping conditions to help facilitate better sleep quality using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-vs-oura-ring-gen-3">Galaxy Ring</a>.</p><p>Also, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-one-ui-6-watch-wear-os-5-official-rollout">Energy Score insights</a> was introduced on the Galaxy Watch during the fall when Samsung rolled out its Wear OS 5-based update. That press release highlighted its "intuitive" nature, delivering a score based on your sleep, physical activity, heart rate, and more. When you wake up, that score will clue you into how hard you should or shouldn't push yourself.</p><p>One UI 7 devices are the only ones preparing for this update later in March. While that's a bummer, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-says-one-ui-7-will-launch-in-april-announces-beta-programs-for-more-devices">recently said</a> other eligible phones should begin receiving its major Android update in April.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> is set to become one of the thinnest smartphones on the market, and making any piece of technology that slim is a balance. By making a phone slimmer, battery life and performance could drop as a consequence. Additionally, thinner devices are more likely to bend, especially if they're using the same materials and construction as their thicker counterparts — does anyone remember "bendgate" on the iPhone 6?</p><p>Luckily, it seems that Samsung is aware of the risks of building an ultra-slim smartphone and plans to attack durability concerns head-on. While Samsung has been tight-lipped regarding Galaxy S25 Edge specs, Samsung's UK Marketing Director Annika Bizon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-phones/exclusive-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-will-have-durability-to-match-its-sexy-form">first confirmed to TechRadar</a> that durability is one of two "really exciting" features for the South Korean company.</p><p>First, Bizon discussed the accomplishment of building a flagship phone in a form factor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-is-likely-coming-on-april-16">rumored to be just 5.84mm thick</a>. "I can’t say too much, but what I will say is that [the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge] is about beautiful form factor. And there are two points I want to make,” Bizon told TechRadar. “One is that it’s absolutely stunning. And if you think about the technology that’s going into that size of space, it’s pretty impressive."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-side-comparison-01" alt="A close look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wpf4WErM4F2oV6EVBhe6DD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The side profile of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next, the Samsung exec touted the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability, which is crucial for the phone to be successful. Thinner phones are widely believed to be less durable than thicker ones, and the company will need to dispel that notion to get customers to buy into the Galaxy S25 Edge's impossible form factor.</p><p>"The second thing I’ll say concerns durability. With anything slim, durability [has to come as part of the package]. Those are the two features [of the Edge] that are exciting [for us]," said Bizon in the TechRadar interview. "Well, I know durability isn't exciting — but it's really important. So watch this space, because there are some exciting things to come regarding this phone."</p><p>As has been the case with past Galaxy S25 Edge teasers, these comments about the phone's durability are quite cryptic. Fortunately, recent Galaxy S25 Edge rumors and leaks might shed some light on what durability breakthroughs Samsung is talking about. A report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s25-edge-ceramic-build-exclusive/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> predicts the smartphone will use an Armor Aluminum frame, but in a first for Samsung, could feature ceramic on the back. At the moment, it's unclear whether the back is tipped to be fully ceramic or glass-infused ceramic.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3119px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="3MpHizJuDsTHcVf3WNdiaN" name="samsung-unpacked-galaxy-s25-edge-hanging" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge in person at Samsung Unpacked 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3MpHizJuDsTHcVf3WNdiaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3119" height="1755" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm inclined to believe that Samsung has a few other durability tricks up its sleeve beyond the rumored use of ceramic. That's because ceramic isn't exactly new to smartphones. Ceramic-infused glass is currently used on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-gorilla-armor-2">Galaxy S25 Ultra's Gorilla Armor</a>, and it's also available as Ceramic Shield on iPhones. Additionally, longtime Android fans might remember that the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus was actually offered in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/ceramic-galaxy-s10-worth-it">ridiculous $1,2500 variant with a fully-ceramic back</a>.</p><p>But focusing on the ceramic rumor reveals a few key benefits for the Galaxy S25 Edge. For starters, ceramic is stronger than glass, which would help the Galaxy S25 Edge's durability. Wireless charging also works through both ceramic and ceramic-infused glass, so that's still an option. Although the frame of the Galaxy S25 Edge is still rumored to be aluminum, a ceramic back and/or a ceramic-infused glass front could add structural integrity to this phone — reducing the likelihood of the Galaxy S25 Edge bending.</p><p>The other benefit of ceramic no one seems to be talking about is that it has a higher thermal conductivity than glass. What does this mean for the Galaxy S25 Edge? Essentially, it means heat coming from the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset</a> and the battery would be dissipated better with a ceramic back compared to glass. This could reduce thermal throttling and allow the Galaxy S25 Edge to perform well despite its constrained form factor.</p><p>Even if the rumors are true, and ceramic is the only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">durability improvement</a> offered on this phone, it could go a long way to making the Galaxy S25 Edge less prone to bending than other thin phones.</p>

<p>If there's a theme with the Galaxy S25 Edge, at least from Samsung's perspective, it's limiting compromises. The goal of this handset appears to be to offer an ultra-thin smartphone with as few sacrifices as possible.</p><p>“The thing with slim phones is people want to know that they’re still getting very good technology," Bizon explains. "Innovation is in our DNA. It’s about the right timing, and when we think a product is ready to take to market, coupled with the fact that people do want form factor changes."</p>

<ul><li>Google highlights the return of automatic third-party photo content sharing via Partner Sharing.</li><li>A post states this will return as a new "Include content from other Android apps" option within the Photos app's Partner Sharing settings.</li><li>While Google originally removed it to help reduce "clutter," user feedback has pushed it to return the feature.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is rolling out an update for Photos that brings the return of a feature it dropped a few months ago.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/thread/328797818/share-contents-from-other-android-apps-to-your-partner">community post</a>, the Google Photos team highlighted the return of Partner Sharing for users on Android (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/03/06/google-photos-partner-sharing-from-other-apps-screenshots-change/">9to5Google</a>). As the company reiterates, Partner Sharing was an easy tool users could leverage to share pictures from third-party apps. Google originally removed it with the goal of "reducing clutter" and promoting "focus" on your partner's feed.</p><p>However, a wealth of user feedback has urged Google to return it to form.</p><p>Rolling out this week, Google says the Photos app will pick up a new setting where "screenshots or saved photos backed up from other apps" are shared with your partner automatically. The post states the "other apps" specification concerns apps like social media and the like. Users will retain a bit of privacy as Google says the "Include content from other Android apps" setting is disabled by default.</p><p>Additionally, users are said to always remain in control of what third-party photos <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1">are shared with partners</a>. Once this arrives, if you've enabled it, your screenshots and pictures from other apps will be shown to your partner. If disabled at any time, those photos will disappear from their view.</p><p>Users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-drops-partner-sharing-support-for-photos-from-other-android-apps">voiced their opinions</a> behind Google's removal of automatic screenshot/saved third-party pictures in Photos last November. Without much warning, users noticed their screenshots were no longer appearing on their partner's feed. Google hadn't communicated the change via a Photos app pop-up. Instead, the company quitely highlighted the change in a support document.</p><p>It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that Google properly announced the change, stating it was for the sake of "reducing clutter."</p><p>The original reports from Reddit stated downloads, screenshots, and photos from other Android apps weren't being shared. The Google Photos update rolling out this week with the new setting should return things to how it was.</p><p>Speaking of decluttering your app, Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-collections-library-replacement-rollout">Collections tab</a> in Photos was made for just that purpose. The view offered a themed view for all of your albums, like "People & Pets," "Places," and "Documents." During its arrival, the company said it wanted to "streamline" the experience for users looking to get into certain memories quickly. Elsewhere, Google kicked off its test in the U.S. for "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ai-powered-search-is-here-for-a-few-lucky-souls">Ask Photos</a>," an AI-based feature that lets you talk to Gemini about your stored content.</p><p>The test kicked off last fall and, since then, the company has rolled out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-ask-photos-ui-search-redesign-rollout">a slight UI redesign</a> to give users more agency.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a powerful smartphone with a ton of AI features, a huge display, and seven years of OS/security updates; you&apos;re a Verizon customer or willing to switch; you&apos;re down to sign up for one of the industry&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/best-unlimited-data-plans">best wireless plans</a>.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a trade-in deal or an unlocked phone; you&apos;re happy with your current wireless setup; one of the other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-s25-deals-of-the-month">Galaxy S25 deals</a> out there works better for you.  </p><p>Easily one of the most powerful phones on the market today, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra boasts a stunning 6.9-inch AMOLED 120Hz display with seven years of guaranteed OS updates, all of the latest Galaxy AI software features, and the unrivalled efficiency of Qualcomm&apos;s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. The camera system is also quite versatile, and like past Ultra phones, you get the convenience of an S Pen stylus embedded directly into the device.  </p><p>The Unlimited Ultimate plan gives you unlimited talk, text, and data on Verizon&apos;s 5G Ultra Wideband network, plus you get 60GB of mobile hotspot data every month, unlimited international coverage in over 210 countries worldwide, and a free Apple One subscription. </p><p>Starting at $90 per month for one line, Verizon&apos;s best data plan isn&apos;t exactly cheap, but you can lower the cost considerably by adding multi-line discounts and signing up for AutoPay. If you want a new phone but the Unlimited Ultimate plan won&apos;t work with your situation, fear not: there are a ton of other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a> that are a bit easier to swallow, from trade-in discounts to plan options that you can customize yourself.

<ul><li>Google removed over 180 apps spanning across 56 million downloads, due to a massive ad fraud scheme tricking advertisers into paying for fake user engagement.</li><li>The fraudsters created vapor apps, that were disguised as genuine popular apps, that ran recurring ads making it difficult for users to delete.</li><li>The IAS Threat Lab worked with Google to identify and take down these apps from the Play Store</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google is working on deleting a massive number of apps from its Play Store following an“extensive and sophisticated ad fraud scheme” (as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2025/03/05/googles-play-store-deletion-do-not-keep-all-these-apps-on-your-phone/">Forbes</a>), that seems to have impacted over 56 million downloads that spanned across 180 odd apps.</p><p>According to the publication, it seems like Google was trying to play catch up by sending out security patches in an attempt to fix the issue that’s causing several apps to turn malicious. However, it seems like it was all in vain, and now the only way to practically fix this issue was by deleting the apps that caused it.</p><p>An Ad-fraud scheme is different from a Malware or a Firmware that takes over devices. It involves people tricking advertisers into paying for genuine user engagement in the pretext of showing these ads on real apps, however they are not actually reaching real users.  It could also show users ads extensively on the app, which will lower user experience, leading to people moving away from Play Store to download apps.</p><p>Furthermore, the publication adds that these fraudsters create something called “vapour” apps and showcase them on the popular category of the app store and users unknowingly will download these look-alike apps (like flashlights or QR code readers) but end up getting one filled with unnecessary ads. “Upon installation, these apps are often accompanied by a persistent notification, subtly ensuring their continued operation. Some of these apps have no visible icon or ‘open’ button available for the user to interact with,” Forbes added.</p>
<h2 id="how-google-tackled-this-2">How Google tackled this</h2>
<p>This not only impacts users but also genuine advertisers who are willing to shell out money to make their products more visible on the App Store. Genuine app developers who rely on advertisers for revenue are also impacted by this scheme, undermining the overall integrity of the Play Store. It seems like these apps have slipped through Google Play Protect as well,  Android’s defense against malware and permission abuse, which is essentially there to keep devices safe from harmful apps.</p><p>Finally, Integral Ad Science (IAS), a global media measurement and optimization platform worked with Google to “actively disrupt this fraudulent operation, collaborating with industry partners to minimize its impact.” As a result, Google has removed all fraudulent apps from the Play Store.</p><p>In response to IAS’ <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://integralads.com/insider/ias-threat-lab-fraud-scheme-fake-android-apps/">report, </a>Google stated it is taking proactive measures to protect the Play Store from these vapor apps. “Google Play Protect will warn users and automatically disable these apps, even when they originate from sources outside of Google Play.”</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-142">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>AYANEO has officially announced the Pocket Micro Classic.</li><li>This Android gaming handheld is essentially the same as the Pocket Micro, minus the joysticks.</li><li>Pricing for the Micro Classic starts at $179, and shipping is expected to start in the "middle of April."</li></ul>
<p>Last year was a banner year for AYANEO, as the company released an onslaught of both Windows and Android handhelds. On the Android side, the Pocket DMG and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/ayaneo-pocket-micro-review">Pocket Micro</a> were easily two of the most intriguing handhelds that we've seen in recent memory.</p><p>And now, the Pocket Micro Classic gets even closer to imitating one of Nintendo's classics. Basically, everything about the Pocket Micro and the Micro Classic is identical. This includes the Aluminum chassis, 3.5-inch IPS borderless display, and MediaTek Helio G99 SoC.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/skC3rDreV44" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>In case it wasn't obvious, the only key difference is that AYANEO ditched the dual joysticks from the Micro with its latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/best-android-gaming-handheld-consoles">handheld</a>. In doing so, it also appears to have moved the D-pad and ABXY buttons down slightly to help fill up some of the space.</p><p>With this change, the Pocket Micro Classic looks like the perfect modern successor to the original Game Boy Micro. This is especially true of the "Retro Gold" color, which features a gold front paired with a red CNC aluminum shell.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Dyoaz2YN2GpxejD36HkPx8" name="ayaneo-pocket-micro-classic-promo-render-1" alt="AYANEO Pocket Micro Classic in Retro Gold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dyoaz2YN2GpxejD36HkPx8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As for performance, well, it'll be identical to the "regular" Pocket Micro. The Helio G99 is paired with either 6GB or 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of expandable storage. Meanwhile, the 3.5-inch display, with its 960 x 480 resolution, offers perfect 4X upscaling for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-game-boy-game-boy-advance-emulators-android">Game Boy Advance</a> games.</p><p>Obviously, the Helio G99 is capable of playing games from systems that are far more powerful than the GBA. So what does that mean if you end up wanting to play PS1 games but don't have a joystick? AYANEO claims you'll be able to switch between the D-pad and left joystick mode by long-pressing the ST and = buttons found on the front bottom lip.</p>

<p>This isn't entirely unheard of, as there are plenty of retro handhelds that offer similar implementations. However, it will be interesting to see if AYANEO also makes this available from the AYASpace Menu in case you forget the button combination.</p><p>Currently, there are three colors to choose from, across two different RAM and storage configurations. Pricing for the 6GB model with 128GB of storage starts at $179. If you want 8GB of RAM and double the storage, you're looking at either $209 for the Magic Black color, or $239 for both the Retro Gray and Retro Gold colors. You can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ayaneo.com/goods/9048974164213">pre-order one starting today</a> and AYANEO is expected to begin shipping its latest handheld sometime in the "middle of April."</p>

<ul><li>Google is testing out an expansion of AI Overviews called 'AI Mode.'</li><li>This will help users understand complex topics by generating results that incorporate advanced reasoning and thinking capabilities.</li><li>AI Overviews powered by Gemini 2.0 will now be available to teens without needing them to sign in.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-mode-search/">announced</a> today that it is testing out a search mode that has the ability to answer complex questions and go beyond just a few pointers that appear with AI Overviews.</p><p>According to the tech giant this mode has, "advanced reasoning, thinking, and multimodal capabilities." This means when users ask questions on AI Mode, the AI chatbot will not just give you an entire page's worth of answers but will also give you follow-up questions in case you want to take the search further.</p><p>The AI Mode shows up as an additional tab/option below the Google search bar, on the left-hand side of the "All" option. According to Google, it received feedback from "power users" that they'd like to see more AI responses to their searches.  This is why the company has now started testing this model which is powered by Gemini 2.0</p><p>The difference between AI Overviews and AI Mode is that it will give you answers to nuanced questions in one go, rather than having users sieve through multiple searches. It could be particularly helpful when users are trying to do a deep dive into a new concept or when comparing varied options.</p><p>For instance, you can ask Google how Déjà vu works and how it pertains to memory, with Overviews, you only get the answer to what Déjà vu is and links to studies, however with the new AI Mode, Google explains,  it will give you several pointers on the above and also explain how the concept relates to memory. As seen below:</p>

<p>"It uses a “query fan-out” technique, issuing multiple related searches concurrently across subtopics and multiple data sources and then brings those results together to provide an easy-to-understand response," the press release added.</p><p>The images show AI mode on both browsers as well as the mobile app, hinting at a dual rollout and easier access to this feature.</p><p>As the company is still testing out this feature, it cations users that they may encounter some challenges with this and the answers may be inaccurate or even show up as the AI supporting a particular opinion, which will be addressed in the next phase of testing.</p><p>Additionally, Google announced that AI Overviews will now be powered by Gemini 2.0. Making it easier for the LLM to answer queries related to coding, and advanced math while showing Overviews for more search results. Lastly, teens can also use AI Overviews without needing to sign in/verify their age.</p><p>As AI Mode continues to be in a testing phase, and starting today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/about/ai-premium/" target="_blank">Google One AI Premium</a> subscribers can try out this experience in Labs. While we still wait for an official rollout.</p>

<ul><li>Google is updating the Linux kernel version of older Pixel devices with the March 2025 security patch.</li><li>The Google Pixel 6, Pixel 7, and Pixel 8 series are now using the 6.1.x version as of the latest update.</li><li>This move was previously reported way back in January 2024, and is just now being made.</li></ul>

<p>Google rolled out its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March Feature Drop</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-march-2025-security-patch-rolls-out">March 2025 security patch</a> for eligible Pixel phones this week, and the latter included an under-the-radar tweak that is making older Pixels run smoother. As spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3p6s9/pixels_with_tensor_cpu_get_61x_linux_kernel/" target="_blank">Reddit user</a>, the Linux kernel on devices with older Tensor processors has been updated to the 6.1.x version (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phones-kernel-upgrade-march-update-3532360/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Previously, phones with Tensor G3 chipsets and older were running the older version 5.10.x of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-z-what-kernel">Linux kernel</a>.</p><p>This is a subtle change that could lead to big benefits for people daily driving a Pixel 6, Pixel 7, or Pixel 8 series device. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Google Pixel 9 series</a> already had the 6.1.x version of the Linux kernel, but this is the first time the newer version has made its way to a stable update for older devices. Users are noticing this tweak after applying the March 2025 update for Pixels.</p><p>One user says that "the phone feels extremely responsive compared to pre- March update," according to the Reddit thread. Another reports that they are "seeing a good boost in battery life since March update." It's unclear whether these improvements are directly linked to the kernel update, but it's nevertheless a positive sign for owners of aging Pixel phones.</p><p>Separately, another Reddit user reports that the March 2025 patch has updated the baseband version for their Pixel 8 Pro, which could lead to less background battery drain.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1j3p6s9/pixels_with_tensor_cpu_get_61x_linux_kernel">Pixels with Tensor CPU, get 6.1.x Linux kernel</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel">r/GooglePixel</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>You can check the Linux kernel version for your device by opening the Settings app. Then, tap <strong>About phone </strong>> <strong>Android version</strong> and find the number listed under <strong>Kernel version</strong>. If you are running a beta or developer preview build, your older Pixel device may have already updated its kernel version before the March 2025 security update.</p><p>Google's seven-year update promise hinges on it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/7-years-of-updates-arent-what-you-think-they-are-and-samsung-just-proved-it">being able to deliver new updates to older chipsets</a>, and things like routine Linux kernel update are crucial to the company fulfilling that promise.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/kernel-upgrade-for-tensor-powered-pixel-phones">A report from January 2024</a> predicted that Google would bump the Linux kernel version of older Pixels to the 6.1.x version, and that now comes over a year later.</p>
