OPPO also leaned heavily into AI this year, introducing smarter tools like AI Portrait Glow, which fine-tunes lighting in selfies, and AI Mind Space, designed to organize thoughts and ideas more naturally.</p><h2 id="battery-behemoths-2">Battery behemoths</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G8CzntK4kvC4VzzRZUBre9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8CzntK4kvC4VzzRZUBre9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> is the standout performer, packing a huge 7,500mAh battery with support for 80W wired and 50W wireless charging, while the standard Find X9 isn’t far behind with 7,025mAh and the same charging speeds. Both models sport AMOLED displays — 6.59 inches for the Find X9 and 6.78 inches for the Pro — each featuring a 120 Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of up to 3,600 nits.</p><p>On the optics side, the Find X9 Pro boasts a 200MP telephoto sensor with 3× periscope zoom. It also supports an optional detachable teleconverter lens for up to 10× native optical zoom, a first for OPPO. The regular Find X9 still holds its own with a triple 50MP rear setup, offering much of the same imaging prowess without costing extra.</p><p>Design-wise, the phones feel premium yet distinctive. The Find X9 series features flat edges and aluminum frames that give them a modern look. OPPO also introduced new colorways — the Find X9 comes in Velvet Red, Space Black, and Titanium Grey, while the Pro model offers Silk White and Titanium Charcoal. Both are built tough with IP68 and IP69 water- and dust-resistance ratings, so they can handle spills and splashes.</p><h2 id="smart-shortcut-2">Smart shortcut</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A new hardware addition, the Snap Key, lets users instantly trigger key functions like the camera or AI features.

Both will roll out across Europe by late November, followed by other global markets through OPPO’s online stores, retail partnerships, and interactive in-store displays.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication alleges that this "battery increase" isn't for the buds themselves, but for the charging case.</p><p>The post suggests that Samsung is looking to increase the Galaxy Buds Pro 4 case battery to roughly 530mAh.</p><p>For reference, and as the publication also notes, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's</a> charging case is only 15mAh lower, at 515mAh. So, while this alleged increase is "higher" number-wise, it might not drastically change how much extra power consumers can get. Although an increase might just work, no matter what it looks like. On the other side, rumors allege that Samsung is progressing through its Galaxy Buds 4 series development in order to meet its quick launch date.</p><p>There are theories that Samsung wants to launch the Galaxy Buds 4 series alongside the Galaxy S26 series early next year.</p><h2 id="no-time-to-linger-2">No time to linger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="x4u2pJnsewSVLbRevMUtcN" name="galaxy-buds3-pro-with-gw7-buds-control.jpg" alt="Galaxy Buds 3 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/x4u2pJnsewSVLbRevMUtcN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a lot more to unravel about the potential that is the Galaxy Buds 4 series, as recent rumors claim Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">started its software development</a>. This rumor cropped up during the One UI 8.5 streak in September, where a tipster allegedly discovered the early test build for the new earbuds. It looks like Samsung is preparing to debut the buds with the upcoming One UI 8.5 software, which sort of lines up with the latest rumors today.</p><p>The code suggests that consumers would see two iterations: a Buds 4 and a Buds 4 Pro, but nothing more was discovered. For that, we'll have to look elsewhere, deeper in One UI 8.5's code.</p><p>Tipsters <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/leaked-galaxy-buds-4-icon-one-ui-8-5-another-new-look-for-samsung">diving into the software's early code</a> reportedly discovered a redesign for the Galaxy Buds 4 through a listed icon. It looks like Samsung could move away from the Buds' current design, which leans on Apple's AirPods take, for something different. The icon shows a bud with a silicon tip, a rounded body, but a "detached" stem. Instead of the current series, which has its main body and stem seamlessly integrated, the Galaxy Buds 4 could see the stem "attached" onto the body for visible separation.</p><p>Other than this icon, there's nothing else about the buds to go on, so take this with a grain of salt for now.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When is the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro 4 release date?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Galaxy Buds 4 Pro are widely rumored to launch in early 2026, likely debuting alongside the flagship Galaxy S26 series at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of the year (expected around January or February 2026).</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

The company calls this a "core update," one that brings a more natural conversation experience between the user and the AI. Consumers won't have any extra price tags for this, as it's simply a change in AI.</p><p>To access Gemini's new Home assistance, users can continue using the "Hey Google" wake-up voice line. The post states users can say this command to their connected speakers or display device and find "richer answers, set and edit reminders, stream media, and control your smart home..."</p><p>If you're looking to leverage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/how-use-gemini-live-camera-screen-sharing">Gemini Live's</a> intelligence, users must say, "Hey Google, let's chat." This will open up a new level of the AI's assistance to help users "deepen their knowledge" on a range of complex topics. Users can ask about VR, understand articles online, or even help their kids with their homework.</p><p>Gemini Live in this Home upgrade can also help parents figure out the perfect meals for their picky little eaters and even practice some public speaking.</p><h2 id="get-the-door-it-s-gemini-2">Get the door, it's Gemini</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf" name="google-nest-gemini-doorbell-hazel" alt="The new Google Nest Doorbell (3rd Gen) in hazel up against a door." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VDpryrWxWZW4R5bFHAZ6Kf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the multiple (100 things to try) prompts and queries users have with Gemini, the AI's smart home capabilities leap forward. As the early access test rolls out today, users can utilize the AI to scroll back through their camera history and create new automations without touching their phones. However, you will need the Google Home Premium subscription to do such tasks.</p><p>If you enrolled previously, then you should notice these new goodies today. If you haven't, and you're interested, users must <strong>open Google Home (v4.1 or higher) > Tap Settings > Tap "Early Access."</strong> There is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Top-Questions-amp-Answers-about-Gemini-for-Home-Google-Home-Premium-and/ba-p/750844">an extensive walk-through</a> of information, as well as Google's supported devices for this test for users.</p><p>What's interesting is that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/invites-for-google-gemini-for-home-arriving-for-some-android-users">we were hearing reports</a> of Gemini for Home appearing for some users earlier in October. Users on Reddit reported receiving the email about the test's appearance, though some features were missing, despite users having the required subscription. So, perhaps, these were the early instances of the test rolling out, and Google's now pushing it more officially to enrolled testers.</p><p>Either way, Gemini for Home is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">positioned as a major overhaul</a> for the smart home experience with Google. Gemini's involvement brings punchier helpfulness to users looking to scrub back through their camera feeds, check their Home Brief, and loads more, as revealed at the beginning of the month.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The reason behind this potential price hike is that, according to the publication, Samsung is running into a "shortage" of available DRAM for mobile devices and computers.</p><p>This shortage is reportedly the result of a sharp rise in HBM (high-bandwidth memory) production used for AI servers.</p><p>There's more to this, as the publication states HBM is "more than five times more profitable than standard DRAM." Samsung has moved significantly into this HBM production world, crafting the necessary components to sustain the rise of AI and AI servers. While producing more HBM is seemingly more "profitable" for Samsung (and other companies), it's left its DRAM high and dry with its required resources.</p><p>What appears like a neglect in DRAM production will reportedly directly affect Samsung's phones, but only its "low to mid-priced phones." Going by that, perhaps Galaxy A series and below could take a hit, though it's unclear if future FE phones could see similar price hikes.</p><h2 id="samsung-s-got-to-make-changes-2">Samsung's got to make changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4136px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-06" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus face down on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bMGNgaiDpvBLRBkV4yca2Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4136" height="2326" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as Android is concerned, the DRAM problem is worrying; however, Samsung's efforts in ramping up HBM are causing price hikes for SSDs.</p><p>For now, it seems consumers can breathe easy about a potential price increase for future Galaxy S series phones, something we did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-was-smart-not-to-raise-the-price-of-the-galaxy-s25-ultra">when the Galaxy S25 launched</a>, too. Earlier this year, it was made evident that Samsung didn't drop a price hike on the S25 series, notably the S25 Ultra, like speculation previously theorized. This was a good thing as the Ultra already carries quite a hefty $1,299 price tag, like the S24 Ultra when it launched.</p><p>It's important to note that the S24 Ultra saw a $100 increase over the S23 Ultra, but a representative informed Android Central that the cost matched the improvements. They said in a statement, "Over the last three years, we have added and improved Ultra dramatically, and we have prided ourselves in providing an absolute best value that we can to our customers."</p><p>Perhaps, with what's going on with Samsung's current DRAM shortage, the company is looking to recoup those costs elsewhere, without forcing it on its Galaxy S. We are expecting the Galaxy S26 series next year; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">it might've been delayed</a>. New rumors claim the S26 series could debut in March 2026, not January.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you prefer to buy your phones unlocked and can wait a few more weeks, it might be worth waiting to see what retailers like Amazon and Best Buy do with the Pixel 9a. The phone dropped to $364 during October Prime Day, for instance, and I wouldn't be surprised if it hit that same record low again when the Black Friday sales begin in earnest.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're already a T-Mobile subscriber and you don't mind adding a new line to your wireless service, then this Google Pixel 9a deal is a truly unmissable opportunity that no Black Friday sale can touch. </p><h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2025-2">When is Black Friday 2025?</h2><p>Black Friday historically falls on the day after Thanksgiving in the United States, which means the 2025 event is set to occur on November 28th.

This phone will probably boast the same $500 price tag as past A-series Pixel releases, plus it's sure to be equipped with the Tensor G5 chipset, great cameras, and all of the latest AI software features. Is it worth waiting six more months to buy the new Pixel 10a? The choice is yours, but I'd say that the Google Pixel 9a is a worthy investment in the meantime. </p> ]]></dc:content>

Reliable leaker Digital Chat Station said on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/QbdJd0Dv1" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that Qualcomm is apparently skipping straight to TSMC's most advanced 2nm manufacturing process, N2P (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-6-leak-3610819/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>To put that in perspective, the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> chip — which powers top-tier phones like the Xiaomi 17 and OnePlus 15 — is built on a 3nm process. By jumping directly to the refined N2P node, Qualcomm is bypassing the first-gen N2 process entirely.</p><p>The N2P process represents TSMC’s second-generation 2nm technology, and it’s already looking impressive on paper. Compared to the N3E node (used for the 3nm-based Snapdragon 8 Elite), N2P promises up to 18% better performance or 36% lower power consumption.</p><p>It also packs around 1.15x the chip density of the current 3nm N3E process, allowing for more transistors in the same space. Simply put, this is the kind of tech shift that could redefine what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android flagships</a> can do over the next few years.</p><h2 id="a-full-platform-overhaul-2">A full platform overhaul</h2><p>Qualcomm is also planning to add support for LPDDR6 RAM and UFS 5.0 storage in the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6. These upgrades should make phones faster and more efficient.</p><p>The new memory and storage standards are also designed with AI-driven tasks in mind, so they may come in handy for the increasingly machine-learning-heavy world of Android software and camera systems.</p><p>Now for the bad news. This cutting-edge technology is expensive. DCS says the cost of the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 6 chip itself is expected to increase greatly. That cost won't be eaten by the manufacturers. It will be passed directly to you.</p><p>So, while the next generation of elite smartphones is poised to be incredibly powerful, those eye-watering prices are only going to get higher.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While Black Friday sales in the past tended to end at midnight that night, many events now last through the weekend and into Cyber Monday (December 1st). Needless to say, I'll be hard at work sharing the best deals that entire weekend, so be sure to watch our site for all of the latest shopping advice from yours truly.</p><h2 id="what-samsung-galaxy-deals-should-i-expect-during-black-friday-2">What Samsung Galaxy deals should I expect during Black Friday?</h2><p>Samsung's entire fleet of Galaxy devices is likely to be discounted in the days leading up to Black Friday, so keep your eyes peeled for deals on the S25 series of smartphones, the Galaxy Watch 8, new Samsung tablets, and so much more.</p><h2 id="should-i-buy-a-samsung-galaxy-phone-today-or-wait-until-black-friday-2">Should I buy a Samsung Galaxy phone today or wait until Black Friday?</h2><p>It depends. Are you seeking a straight, no-strings discount on an unlocked device? If so, I'd probably wait, as the Black Friday deals are certain to get better in the coming weeks.</p><p>On the other hand, if you're looking for a trade-in opportunity or upgrade deal from your wireless provider, it's unlikely that carrier deals will get much better than they are right now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The leak comes from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10a">Android Headlines</a> claiming that the Pixel 10a will keep its predecessors' design, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/googles-ugly-pixel-9a-design-is-exactly-what-you-wanted">seeing some contradicting responses</a> with the Pixel 9a.</p><p>The images show the alleged Pixel 10a in a bright blue like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7'</a>s colorway, but the publication notes that this is just for display purposes only.

Considering the phone could show up with a "boosted" Tensor G4 chip, instead of the faster Tensor G5 on the Pixel 10 series. The publication also notes that the Pixel 10a will be the same size as the Pixel 9a, measuring 153.9 x 72.9 x 9mm.</p><p>So far, we know that Google would be sticking to a similar $499 price range for its next budget phone, considering Google aims to keep this series as affordable as possible.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

Should you think about buying one?</p><p>Enjoy our content?

If you only want <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Google Gemini</a> to answer questions or execute your commands, your phone can do that, so you don't need one. Likewise for your music. There are many ways to pipe music into a room, and some sound a lot better than any smart speaker can.</p><p>The lure is the <em>combination</em> of the two. Gemini tells you about your day every morning, transitions to playing your latest playlist from YouTube Music or Spotify, and lets you know whether you should take an umbrella to work. One unit that does everything can be handy.</p><p>Even more so if you have other smart home devices. Yelling "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-led-light-bulbs-work-google-home">Turn On The Lights!</a>" into a dark room or having an electronic butler of sorts adjust the thermostat when you're chilly is both fun and useful. A smart speaker does all that and more, too.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KUvdfm8C8Vt5XVjLzaqTkS" name="google home smart speaker 2025" alt="Google Home smart speaker 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KUvdfm8C8Vt5XVjLzaqTkS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Home Speaker isn't here yet, so saying whether you should buy it is impossible. But it's never too early to think about what you might want to get next. Based on what we know today, there are several good reasons you might want one.</p><p><strong>It will have a great price tag</strong>. Google says the Google Home Speaker will launch at $99. It's easy to spend 99 bucks on things that will never be useful, so seeing a price this low is welcome.</p><p><strong>It's designed to be conversational</strong>. Google says a big part of the new experience will be naturally talking to your smart speaker. As a user of smart home devices, this is a welcome change. You can get one to do anything as long as you ask the "right way," now, and I'll admit sometimes that "right way" seems silly.</p><p><strong>It supports virtual 360-degree audio</strong>. Cramming four or more speakers into a plastic box sounds like speakers crammed into a plastic box without proper audio processing. The right <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-android-users-need-know-about-spatial-audio">spatial audio support</a> can make the Google Home Speaker sound a lot better, even if it doesn't rival a true home audio setup. Here's hoping it's great.</p><p><strong>It will pair with the Google TV Streamer</strong>. Just $300 ($100 for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-review">TV Streamer</a> and two Google Home Speakers at $100 each) will give you a ready-made home theater system, and that's a big deal. Providing everything works as promised, the setup is easy and wireless, and the total cost will be less than the price of some single home theater speakers that require hard wiring. This genuinely has me excited since I'm not ever going to run wires or spend a bunch of money on the bedroom.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6917px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XnrU9cCJ5fuzWkiZz6oiWY" name="google-home-speaker-gemini-black-option-countertop" alt="The Google Home Speaker in black, sitting on a countertop while a model walks by." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XnrU9cCJ5fuzWkiZz6oiWY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6917" height="3891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned, we don't know a lot about the product and how it will fall short of expectations. I promise it will in at least a few ways, but we do have Google's history in the smart home to consider.</p><p>Specifically, support. Google loves to improve its products, which often means things that still work great get left behind. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/chromecast-audio-being-discontinued">Chomecast Audio</a> and older <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-is-dropping-support-for-the-first-two-generations-of-nest-learning-thermostat">Nest Learning Thermostats</a> are prime examples.</p><p>As someone who is affected by this far more often than I would like, I have to mention it. As of today, the only supported Google Home products (according to Google itself) are:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/should-you-buy-nest-aware-subscription-your-nest-camera">Nest Camera</a> (wired and battery)</li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/the-new-nest-thermostat-has-a-better-display-and-you-can-personalize-its-home-screen">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> (4th gen), Nest Thermostat, Nest Temperature Sensor</li><li>Google Nest Hub, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/nest-hub-max-review">Google Nest Hub Max</a>, Google Nest Mini, Google Home Mini, Google Home, Google Home Max, <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-announces-nest-audio-google-home-successor-2020">Google Nest Audio</a>.</li></ul><p>That's a long list of products, but they all share one thing in common: they are relatively new (and possibly still a great buy right now with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/gemini-for-home-is-here-new-nest-cameras-ai-home-speaker-debut">Gemini support rolling out</a>). I have the original Google Home Mini here in a box in case I want to scavenge any parts from it, and I can tell you it worked as well on its last day as it did on its first. It was discontinued, then support was dropped simply to favor new products.</p><p>Google's not alone here, and this is the nature of technology. While $100 isn't a lot of money in 2025, it's also not something you want to throw away when the next shiny thing comes along.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><p>So, should you think about getting one? Yes, if you're entrenched in Google's ecosystem or a smart home fan.</p><p>I like the price and the supposed features. There's a lot of value there for anyone who wants Google Gemini in the room, "helping" during day-to-day life. The smart home factor alone makes it worth it for anyone whose disability means they need a helping hand from time to time.</p><p>I'm considering buying three myself. One on the table in the living room can do all those Gemini things, and I hate the audio on my bedroom television, but hate the idea of spending a lot of money or running wires. I'm currently using a Nest Hub with a bit of duct tape over the camera in the bedroom, so a setup with the Google Home Speakers can pull double duty.</p><p>I'm not telling you to buy a product I've never touched and that hasn't been released yet. I am saying there's a lot to think about here, especially when there are already several Google smart home speakers that you can buy right now.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>When will the Google Home Speaker be available?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>The Google Home Speaker will be available in spring 2026, although Google has not specified when exactly it will hit stores. That said, we can assume Google may time the launch with its annual Google I/O developer conference.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Can you pair the Google Home Speaker with other devices?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Google has teased the ability to pair two Home Speakers and the Google TV Streamer, creating a home theater-like experience powered by Gemini.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Is Gemini available on current Google Nest hardware?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Google is making Gemini available on its current hardware, and as of writing, it is slowly rolling out to users as part of an early-access program. Eligible devices include the Google Nest Hub (2nd gen), Google Nest Audio, Google Nest Mini (2nd gen), and Google Nest Hub Max.

Everything about Vanguard is made with workouts in mind, from the sweatproof design to the Garmin integration. </p></p>                </div>                <div class="pro-con"><div class="list-pros-wrapper"><h4 class="list-pros-label">Pros</h4><ul class="list-pros"><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>12MP camera that can record 3K videos</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>IP67 rating against dust and water ingress</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Longer battery life with up to nine hours on a single charge</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Louder open-ear speakers compared to Ray-Ban Meta</li><li class='list-item list-item-pros'>Meta AI, Strava, and Garmin Connect support</li></ul></div><div class="list-cons-wrapper"><h4 class="list-cons-label">Cons</h4><ul class="list-cons"><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Not as stylish or compact as Ray-Ban Meta</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>You can only use Garmin integration with certain workout types and watches</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>No option for Transitions or prescription lenses</li><li class='list-item list-item-cons'>Pricey</li></ul></div></div>            </div>        </div><p>Meta was hard at work refreshing its smart glasses portfolio over the last few months, starting with the Oakley Meta HSTN launch in the summer. Then, it brought HSTN improvements to second-generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses and added Oakley Meta Vanguard to the lineup. You might be choosing between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 and Oakley Meta Vanguard if you're a sporty user, but which one is best?</p><p>It's a complicated question, because Vanguard is better at one thing — improving your workouts — whereas Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are clearly the more versatile option. As such, if you want a pair of smart glasses for everyday wear and the occasional workout, Ray-Ban will likely serve your needs best. On the flip side, if you need the best smart glasses for workouts, that's going to be Vanguard.</p><p>Let's compare all the differences between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 and Oakley Meta Vanguard to help you decide.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-vanguard-pricing-and-availability-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta Vanguard: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="VdUQBXAsNU2iGC4DaoMjp" name="Ray-Ban-Gen-2-close-up-with-case-top-down" alt="Close-up, top-down photo of the Shiny Cosmic Blue Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Wayfarer glasses laying lenses up, arms down on an armrest, with the official brown Ray-Ban charging case behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VdUQBXAsNU2iGC4DaoMjp.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meta launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</a> smart glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/live/meta-connect-2025-live-blog">at Connect 2025</a>, and they're now widely available for purchase. You can buy Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) now online and at retail partners starting at $379. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oakley-meta-vanguard-hands-on">Oakley Meta Vanguard</a>, there are three different styles to choose from here: Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner. Additionally, prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 are compatible.</p><p>By comparison, Oakley Meta Vanguard are a bit pricier, with a flat $499 price tag. There are a handful of Vanguard frame and lens colors, but the smart glasses only come in one style. While you can swap out the lenses as you please, you're stuck with the side colorway forever, so choose wisely. These smart glasses aren't available with prescription lenses. You can find them at Meta, Oakley, and partner retailers.</p><h2 id="ray-ban-meta-gen-2-vs-oakley-meta-vanguard-design-and-features-2">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) vs. Oakley Meta Vanguard: Design and features</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, close up of the front lenses and camera cutouts." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xNEGWsXdX57MRnXNYWetqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're familiar with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses, it'll be helpful to know that the Gen 2 revision retains an identical frame design. Whether that's a good or bad thing might depend on whether you found the first-generation model comfortable or not. There are still Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles available, as well as large and regular sizes for Wayfarer. Ideally, there are a lot of frame options that'll help users find a good fit.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) glasses did cut a bit of weight this generation, coming in at 48 grams. That's only a four-gram difference compared to Gen 1, but it's a bigger deal when you compare the smart glasses to the new Oakley Meta Vanguard. The latter weighs 66 grams, and while it does offer silicone nose pads for a better fit, Vanguard is still heavy.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="wGkiaFuvNPR2F7VkBerQVe" name="Oakley-Meta-Vanguard-on-trailhead" alt="The Oakley Meta Vanguard sitting atop a wooden trailhead with trees behind it." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wGkiaFuvNPR2F7VkBerQVe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then, there's the difference in look. Oakley Meta Vanguard has one singular curved lens that wraps around the sunglass frames. Of course, this is quite the contrast compared to the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2). That's amplified by the fact that there are no clear, prescription, or Transition lenses available for Vanguard. They're only available as sunglasses, though you can swap the lens color for a different one at a later date.</p><p>Vanguard are giant overall, sporting a hinge-to-hinge length of 136mm and a lens height of 59mm. Being that the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses are smaller and support polarized, clear, prescription, and Transition lenses, they'll fit in more places. They could also be more comfortable than Vanguard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX" name="Ray-Ban-Meta-Gen-2-close-up-front-side" alt="A photo of the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses sitting on a rock, angled to focus on the right camera cutout." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nzjUrGrpqXGxzKKBTBfWkX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notably, the Oakley Meta Vanguard has its camera in the center of the frame, which will provide a better POV-style recording perspective.

However, the Oakley Meta Vanguard does have a few tricks that other Meta smart glasses don't. For one, it offers the longest battery life, up to 9 hours on a single charge. Vanguard also has an IP67 rating for full dust and water-resistance, while the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) only have IPX4 certification.</p><p>Vanguard's speakers are six decibels louder than the ones inside Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2), and Meta claims you can hear them in up to 30 MPH winds. Both glasses feature adaptive volume, which can raise and lower the volume dynamically when loud sounds pass by.</p><p>Additionally, Oakley Meta Vanguard is designed for workouts with Strava and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">Garmin Connect integration</a>.

They're absolutely stellar for hiking, running, and working out, but it'd be impossible to pull them off in a coffee shop.</p><p>Naturally, that limits how often you'll feel comfortable wearing your $500 smart glasses, so you'll have to decide if the value proposition makes sense for your workout needs. Other concerns include weight and comfort — at well over 60 grams, Vanguard might feel unwieldy for those not used to wearing heavy shades while working out. If you can get past those limits, the Vanguard are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> for fitness buffs.</p><p>The Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) are for everyone else. These smart glasses try to do it all and fit in during nearly all situations. That's evidenced by their classic Ray-Ban styles, which won't look out of place in a mall or restaurant. With Meta AI support, a 3K video camera, eight-hour battery life, and open-air speakers, the Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) manage to deliver the same core tech as Vanguard while being more approachable.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5838b86f-44ff-44ad-b06a-773879c9e6c9">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Drr6BvBvMgCFoowJyoiLHk.jpg' alt="An official product render of Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses Wayfarer style with blue frames and blue lenses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2)</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for most</strong></em></p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are the pinnacle of smart glasses, and they'll be able to handle a variety of situations, from casual wear to daily runs.

A recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive update</a> tried to get fancy by replacing the alarm's solid background with your phone's wallpaper. It sounded cool, but in practice, it was a design mess.</p><p>Users quickly found their alarm time rendered in unreadable text over a background with similar color, which is exactly what you don't need when you're half-asleep and trying to stop a blaring noise.</p><p>Google heard the complaints. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/27/google-clock-8-3/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports that the new update walks back that change, and it’s a massive improvement for daily usability. The alarm screen now returns to a solid background, so your time, buttons, and stop/snooze controls are much easier to see. This tweak brings the interface closer to how it looked before the M3 Expressive redesign.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:773px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:109.06%;"><img id="4BzgfNAKstsvkGjfk5SSKe" name="Google-Clock-before-and-after" alt="Google Clock alarm screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4BzgfNAKstsvkGjfk5SSKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="773" height="843" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google Clock with a wallpaper background (left) versus a solid one (right) </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="google-assistant-is-fading-2">Google Assistant is fading</h2><p>The update also includes a subtle branding shift that says a lot about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">Google’s current direction</a>. The Assistant label that used to appear under the alarm’s optional post-wake actions has been replaced with just “Routines.” Functionally, nothing has changed, but this move quietly detaches the feature from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a>’s branding.</p><p>Furthermore, the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-clock-alarm-wallpaper-3610416/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> looked into the app’s code and found signs of a new “pulsing” clock animation coming soon.

And if the leaks are to be believed, the next Samsung foldable could bring serious upgrades to the lineup.</p><p>Samsung solved some of the biggest issues of the Galaxy Z Fold series with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Z Fold 7</a>. The company had been lagging behind competitors in terms of thickness, and the Z Fold 7 solved that with an 8.9mm profile when folded.</p><p>Samsung also managed to reduce the weight to match <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">slab-style flagships</a> while adding a more powerful processor and a brighter, wider outer display that mimics a traditional phone and now stretches closer to the edges.</p><p>However, despite the upgrades, Samsung didn't address (and even removed) a few features from the Z Fold 7. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-support-the-s-pen">dropped S Pen support</a> and didn't increase the battery capacity either. Now, it looks like the Galaxy Z Fold 8 might fix both while bringing other improvements.</p><h2 id="s-pen-support-could-make-a-comeback-2">S Pen support could make a comeback</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-17" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9EvtFQDoc5yYq6nmjzcSWT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://dealsite.co.kr/articles/150200">Dealsite</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1983015611186966618">Jukanlosreve on X/Twitter</a>), Samsung is planning to increase the Galaxy Z Fold 8's battery capacity to about 5,000 mAh next year. This should, on paper, deliver better battery life compared to the current Z Fold 7’s 4,400 mAh cell.</p><p>Another upgrade could be an even less noticeable display crease. The report claims Samsung will use a new "laser-drilling metal plate" technology to reduce the display crease further. There are also rumors of Apple planning to use the same tech for its foldable iPhone next year.</p><p>Additionally, the report mentions Samsung is planning to bring back S Pen support with the next Galaxy Z Fold. It's unclear how this will be implemented, given that Samsung removed the digitizer from the Z Fold 7 to minimize thickness, but the company is reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-will-reconsider-s-pen-return-galaxy-z-fold-7-ditched-it-report">working on an improved S Pen</a>, so we could see that.</p><p>On the whole, though, it seems Samsung isn't slowing down but instead building on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-hit-in-us">success of the Z Fold 7</a> to make the lineup even more appealing — especially with Apple's first foldable expected next year. Of course, a lot could change before its launch, expected around July 2026, but things are looking good for the Galaxy Z Fold 8 already.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, OPPO proved that it could deliver all-rounders that excelled in all areas — not just the cameras.</p><p>With the Find X9 Pro, the Chinese brand is continuing that push. After using the Find X8 Pro and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x8-ultra-review">Find X8 Ultra</a> extensively over the course of 2025, I just wanted to see two things out of a successor: better image tuning, and improved global availability. Thankfully, OPPO did just that; the Find X9 Pro has a new Lumo image engine that overhauls the brand's tuning algorithms, bringing it closer to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a> — my favorite phone right now.</p><p>In other good news, OPPO is finally bringing the Find X9 Pro to western markets, making it an alternative to what Xiaomi and Vivo have to offer in this category. I'm not even counting Google and Samsung, because what OPPO and Vivo are doing with their latest flagships is so far ahead that it would be a disservice to the Chinese brands. If anything, pitting the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> next to the Find X9 Pro or Vivo X300 Pro only illustrates just how far behind Google and Samsung are with their own imaging efforts.</p><p>Anyway, what you need to know is that the Find X9 Pro is incredibly good, and its only real rival is the Vivo X300 Pro. I used the X9 Pro for just over two weeks, and I think this is without a doubt the best OPPO phone yet — and one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> around.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-pricing-and-availability"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="L4PPzdw54nqBVnKhcY8ed9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4PPzdw54nqBVnKhcY8ed9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OPPO unveiled the Find X9 and X9 Pro in China on October 22, and the phones debuted globally in Spain on October 28.

To me, Find X devices have always been characteristized by their bold designs, and I just don't get that feeling with the X9 Pro. Don't get me wrong; the rectangular camera island looks good in its own right, and the metal ring encircling it accentuates the design well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="traBJjoyMajxM3xdXhhiX9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/traBJjoyMajxM3xdXhhiX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's just that the phone doesn't have anywhere close to the same visual flair as the Find X6 Pro or Find X7 Ultra. OPPO's constant tinkering with the design isn't making matters any better; Xiaomi and Vivo now maintain a consistent design aesthetic between generations, but with Find X models, the design changes drastically every year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4946px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9oLuaSwkfuyB4MXF7AxZT9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9oLuaSwkfuyB4MXF7AxZT9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4946" height="2786" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the Find X9 Pro feels good to hold and use, and while it doesn't stand out, the design looks elegant. The size of the camera island means there's little to no wobble when using the phone on a table, and it has good weight distribution. On that subject, OPPO did a fabulous job maintaining a similar in-hand feel as the X8 Pro in spite of the X9 Pro having a massive 7,500mAh battery.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uQznHc82PFeEUpXa3rKLY9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uQznHc82PFeEUpXa3rKLY9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the phone is only 0.1mm thicker and 9g heavier, and that's an achievement in and of itself. What I like the most about the design is that the back and mid-frame have a matte texture this time, making the device that much easier to hold. It does a good job preventing smudges as well, and the Gorilla Glass-reinforced glass has proven to be durable in my testing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/emP2ow4MrmYK9GNomwEEV9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Find X9 Pro is available in Silk White and Titanium Charcoal models, with both getting a matte texture.

I don't get much out of it, but it's good to see the button continuing to exist on Find X devices. Elsewhere, OPPO switched to an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor — again, like Vivo — and it is much better. The positioning is ideal too, unlike previous years.</p><p>Rounding out the design, the phone gets IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, so it's pretty much guaranteed to withstand any weather conditions.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-display"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: Display</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5179px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="XWnaoFMLsMnLFLH7oBXUb9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XWnaoFMLsMnLFLH7oBXUb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5179" height="2917" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Find X9 Pro has the same 6.78-inch AMOLED panel as its predecessor, but what's immediately notable is the bezels — or lack thereof.

The thinner bezels means the phone is a slightly shorter and narrower, and that's always a good thing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b2txACWpHt5X8qdc5frVo9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b2txACWpHt5X8qdc5frVo9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, it's just as good as the X8 Pro; it gets 120Hz refresh, 2,160Hz PWM dimming across the brightness range, and goes up to 3,600 nits in outdoor use.

It does so by showing "dynamic visual cues along the edges of the screen that subtly shift and sway in sync with the vehicle’s movements," and it honestly makes a difference.</p><p>The phone is great at gaming and watching TV shows and movies, but that has been the case on OPPO phones for a while now.

I routinely got two days of use between charges, and the battery lasted a 30-hour flight to the U.S. without needing a charge. The brand is using a higher 15% ratio of silicon in the anode, and that's how it was able to achieve greater density, leading to a much bigger battery than the Find X8 Pro in a chassis that's roughly the same size.</p><p>I don't see any downsides either; the brand guarantees five years of usage while still retaining 80% battery. As always, you get the usual safeguards to extend battery, including setting a charge limit. When it comes to charging, the Find X9 Pro gets 80W charging tech, and it takes just over an hour to charge the battery. There's no bundled charger this time, but you can use any USB PD charger and get 55W charging.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-cameras"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: Cameras</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4951px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="TRa9usbpkT2ZaF85nkr6a9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TRa9usbpkT2ZaF85nkr6a9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4951" height="2789" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Last year's Find X8 Pro did a great job with photos and videos, but it wasn't quite able to measure up to what Vivo was doing. Clearly, OPPO took that as a challenge, because the Find X9 Pro comes with considerable upgrades in this area.</p><p>The phone has a new 50MP f/1.5 Sony LYT-828 module that was made in collaboration with Sony. The sensor is touted to do a better job than dedicated 1-inch modules, and having tested the Find X9 Pro's cameras against the Find X8 Ultra, this is indeed the case.</p><p>There's also a 200MP 3x tele lens that uses the Samsung HP5 imaging module, and it doubles as a macro lens. It has a 70mm focal length, and while there's no dedicated 6x shooter, it does just as good a job thanks to better-quality glass and a hybrid OIS system. It leverages AI to deliver cleaner photos beyond 30x, and I found it to hold its own in this regard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G8CzntK4kvC4VzzRZUBre9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G8CzntK4kvC4VzzRZUBre9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Video recording has gotten a boost as well, with the phone able to shoot 4K120 Dolby Vision video via the main and tele lenses this time, and 4K60 via all the lenses. Vivo is able to hit 4K120 Dolby Vison on all the lenses of the X300 Pro, and considering how similar both phones are, I'm not really sure why the Find X9 Pro's wide-angle lens is inhibited. Regardless, video quality itself is much better this time around, and that's what matters.</p><p>Interestingly, there's now a Hasselblad Teleconverter attachment that you can get with the Find X9 Pro, and it is similar to the X300 Pro and X200 Ultra's external lens. It does 10x digital zoom going up to 200x, and 50x video zoom. The only issue I have with the external lens is that it covers up all the cameras when in use — inhibiting its usability. This isn't an issue on the X300 Pro, and Vivo did a better job with the design of the external lens attachment.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap"

the new cameras and Lumo imaging engine, the Find X9 Pro takes truly standout photos and videos. Daylight shots have excellent color rendition and dynamic range, and there really isn't much to fault in this area. I didn't see any issues even in low-light scenarios, and the Find X9 Pro holds its own against its Vivo sibling.</p><p>The new imaging engine allows you to take full-res 50MP shots as standard, with the phone switching to 25MP or 12MP only in a few scenarios — like when the device gets too hot. This is done automatically, and by default, the phone shoots 50MP stills. Similarly, Motion Photo now has 4K previews, so you get cleaner short videos with the associated images.</p><p>I still prefer the X300 Pro's portrait shots, but I'll admit that the X9 Pro is just as good at segmentation and bokeh. The zoom lens is the real star of the show, producing detailed photos at 3x and 6x. If anything, the wide-angle lens is the only module that feels average, but that's only because of the standard set by the rest of the sensors.</p><p>On the whole, the Find X9 Pro's cameras are among the best of any phone today, and it's honestly just the Vivo X300 Pro that offers a legitimate challenge to the device. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and other flagships just don't measure up.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-software"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: Software</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="LY2KA9VbABbkoWfCpjUbX9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LY2KA9VbABbkoWfCpjUbX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With ColorOS 16, the Find X9 Pro gets a brand-new interface with a much better design. Like Vivo and other Chinese brands, the Android 16-based interface relies on translucent effects, and while it isn't strictly original, it looks great. If anything, I like the cohesiveness of the interface, and there are dozens of small things — like the fingerprint unlock animation — that make the interface fun to use.</p><p>There's no shortage of customizability, and you can get the phone to look like an iPhone without too much of an effort. There's a split notification pane with the toggles to one side, and a clone of Dynamic Island that shows real-time notifications and alerts. There's a smattering of AI features as well, including the usual image editing, translation, and audio-to-text transcribing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="tAvEVYssyWd5AxdKzL6Qj9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tAvEVYssyWd5AxdKzL6Qj9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one utility I actually used quite a bit is Mind Space; you can basically save content to the dedicated dashboard, and it serves as a hub that collates all relevant information. I found it useful to take photos of boarding passes and have it add calendar entries automatically, and save details of briefings from email invites. It also lets you take voice notes easily, and it is quite nifty overall.</p><p>Other than that, the software itself is generally enjoyable. I didn't run into any issues whatsoever, and it is just as fluid as the X300 Pro. The Find X9 Pro will get five Android updates alongside six years of security updates, and that's good enough.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-the-alternatives"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: The alternatives</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iQWseiGa6pDLDtoHBwQ3c9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Vivo X300 Pro is the logical alternative to the Find X9 Pro. Both phones are similar enough that it feels like they're from the same brand. The X300 Pro also has a similar-sized panel, same Dimensity 9500 platform, and the camera is outstanding. The Find X9 Pro has a bigger battery, and the software is a little better to use. But outside of that, you're getting two stellar phones.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x9-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find X9 Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="j6pJVwYAonJoBCdEToJkc9" name="OPPO Find X9 Pro" alt="OPPO Find X9 Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j6pJVwYAonJoBCdEToJkc9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You need one of the best camera phones</li><li>You want a phone that lasts two days between charges</li><li>You need powerful internals with all the extras</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p><ul><li>You want timely software updates</li></ul><p>The Find X9 Pro comes with meaningful upgrades that allows it to stand out in general. The battery lasts two days, and that alone is a big enough differentiator that I see this phone doing really well in Asian countries. Combine that with the groundbreaking cameras, vibrant AMOLED panel with useful features, and the overhauled software, and this is a pretty great phone overall.</p><p>Choosing between the Find X9 Pro and Vivo X300 Pro is down to your preferences of software and image tuning, and having used both devices extensively, I will admit that the Find X9 Pro makes a better case — mostly around the software. There's also the fact that you get a much bigger battery on the Find X9 Pro, and the phone handily beats the global X300 Pro in this area. As for whether it is better than the Pixel 10 Pro XL or Galaxy S25 Ultra, there's no doubt in my mind — the Find X9 Pro is leagues ahead of its Google and Samsung rivals.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s called Pomelli, an AI marketing tool born from a partnership between Google Labs and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-leans-on-google-deepmind-transformative-image-edits-update">Google DeepMind</a>.</p><p>Pomelli is an AI-powered marketing tool built to help small businesses quickly generate polished, scalable campaigns that still feel authentic to their brand. Essentially, it's designed to learn your brand — its tone, style, and visual identity — before creating anything.</p><p>So, how does it work? Pomelli uses AI to understand your business and operates on a three-step process.</p><h2 id="it-learns-your-brand-s-dna-2">It learns your brand's DNA</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:805px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.15%;"><img id="KJzGJiZptabYv5VzFrZXX5" name="Google-Pomelli-business-DNA" alt="Google Pomelli business DNA screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJzGJiZptabYv5VzFrZXX5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="805" height="452" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, it builds what Google calls your "Business DNA". You start by just giving it your website's URL. The AI then scans your site and existing images  to automatically pull out your brand's specific identity. This profile includes your brand's color palette, custom fonts, and existing images. It also analyzes the text to understand your "tone of voice".</p><p>This DNA profile becomes the foundation for everything the tool creates, which is supposed to keep all the content feeling consistent and "authentic" to your specific brand.</p><p>Once Pomelli has your brand’s DNA down, it starts generating custom campaign ideas. If you’ve ever hit a wall trying to brainstorm a new marketing angle, this step is a lifesaver. Pomelli offers tailored concepts you can instantly use or tweak based on your goals. And if you already have a vision, you can just type in a prompt and let the tool generate assets that match your idea.</p><h2 id="you-keep-control-2">You keep control</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:959px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.79%;"><img id="XvHc6KtPKmyrjRhDEKGSkB" name="Google-Pomelli-edit-tools" alt="editing tools within Pomelli" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XvHc6KtPKmyrjRhDEKGSkB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="959" height="535" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The final step is where it all comes together. Pomelli produces a set of finished, high-quality marketing assets ready for use. We're talking stuff ready to be posted on your social media, used in your ads, or put on your site.</p><p>You can look through the different generated creatives  and, importantly, you aren't stuck with the first draft. The tool has built-in editors that let you change the text or tweak the images right inside the platform. When you're happy with an asset, you just download it and it's ready to go.</p><p>Pomelli is launching as a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/pomelli" target="_blank">public beta</a> starting today in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, available in English. Google says it’s still early days, so the team is looking for feedback to fine-tune the experience.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The only other company that offers an equivalent alternative to the Pixel is Samsung, with its Galaxy line of phones. Whether it's long-term software upgrades, great cameras, or long battery life, a Galaxy S series flagship is the only other phone you should be considering as an alternative to the Pixel.</p><p>This brings us to the Pixel 10 Pro XL's biggest competitor, which will soon be the upcoming Galaxy S26 Ultra. We've already gotten a few leaks and rumors about what it might look like, and so far, it's looking pretty neat. The Pixel 10 Pro XL has many strengths to stand tall on, but equally, it has a few big shortcomings that can't be ignored. If you're having a tough time deciding between the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Pixel 10 Pro XL, allow me to clear some of that confusion.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-3" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ker5PtDTkGfwSJGxz2a8jW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The design of Samsung's Galaxy Ultra series in the past few generations has been a bit polarizing. And we get it, the boxy design with sharp corners is not for everyone. Plus, it was one of the bulkiest and heaviest flagships, too. All of this is likely about to change, though, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a>.</p><p>Going by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-and-s26-pro-could-get-a-subtle-but-noticeable-reshuffle" target="_blank">leaked CAD renders</a>, Samsung's upcoming flagship would have more gentle curves, making it look a lot more like the Plus model instead. It is said to have a thickness of just 7.7mm and should be a lot lighter (lower than 218g). These two factors alone put it ahead of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, which is 8.5mm thick and weighs 232 grams.</p><p>When it comes to the display, you should expect nothing but the best in brightness, durability, and color reproduction. In fact, the Galaxy S26 Ultra is slated to get a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-galaxy-s26-ultra-might-pack-a-display-that-hides-your-screen-from-prying-side-glances">Privacy Display feature</a>, which should be exclusive to this model. This also hints at some new display tech in the Ultra, which could be the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsungdisplay.com/eng/media/news/detail/ssdsNews-240227.jsp" target="_blank"> “Flex Magic Pixel” technology</a> we heard of before.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5035px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXqaiSix2JfjJLxiU6WLx9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5035" height="2836" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is built extremely well and feels premium through and through thanks to generous helpings of glass and aluminum. It might not be an easy phone to live with, though, for some, as it's quite heavy and bulky. Some of that added weight is due to the built-in magnets for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a>, which allows you to use the 10 Pro XL natively with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">best MagSafe accessories</a>. Other than this, the 10 Pro XL looks virtually identical to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, so it's familiar in that sense.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL has a 6.8-inch display with plenty of brightness and an adaptable refresh rate. In our review, we found the display to be very legible even under direct sunlight. One thing that hasn't quite been fixed is the PWM dimming rate, which will be an issue if you have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">sensitive eyes</a>. The 10 Pro XL has a 480Hz PWM rate, but this is still very low when compared to some of its peers, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13s-review">OnePlus 13</a>, which has a 2,160Hz PWM rate.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-performance-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Performance and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-gaming-genshin-impact" alt="Playing Genshin Impact on a Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hAQ6J4uRNwQFrgzFoGtieS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is almost certain to get a custom version of Qualcomm's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC</a>. Samsung's partnership with Qualcomm allows it to use a souped-up version of the chip for better performance. The standard Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 promises a 20% boost in CPU and GPU performance, while using 20% less power.</p><p>Other specs of the Galaxy S26 Ultra could include up to 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage, although we're most likely to see 12GB of RAM used in most variants sold globally, just like the S25 Ultra. A new Galaxy S line usually comes with new colors, and the S26 Ultra is expected to get a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-feature-apples-bold-cosmic-orange-leaks-reveal">new orange colorway</a>, similar to the iPhone 17 Pro.</p><p>If Samsung sticks to the same pricing, then the S26 Ultra should start at $1,299.99 and go up to roughly $1,500 for the 1TB variant. Samsung has typically announced the new S series at the start of the year, in January, which means we could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-release-date">expect the same</a> for the S26 Ultra as well.

It gets 16GB of RAM on all storage tiers, which leaves it good headroom for future AI features. The 10 Pro XL comes in four colors, but only the Obsidian shade has the 1TB variant. This Pixel uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> SoC, which we found to be much faster than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a>, but still trails behind Qualcomm's previous flagship, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite" target="_blank">Snapdragon 8 Elite,</a> in benchmarks.</p><p>While games do run well on the Pixel 10 Pro XL, future titles might not run the best, as it lacks support for the latest version of the Vulkan API at launch. It's doubly strange to see this missing, especially after Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-vulkan-standard-is-great-but-adpf-might-be-the-real-miracle">made Vulkan the default standard</a> in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a>. Google says it will be adding this in a future update, but till then, be prepared for spotty performance in certain apps and games.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.9-inch QHD+ AMOLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, Privacy Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua QHD+ OLED, 120Hz Adaptive Refresh Rate, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 3,300 nits peak brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 for Galaxy</p></td><td  ><p>Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB / 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 1TB UFS 4.0 (or UFS 4.1)</p></td><td  ><p>256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>200 MP, f/1.7, 24mm (wide)</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.7, 25mm (wide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>10 MP, f/2.4, 67mm (telephoto)</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 (periscope telephoto)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/3.4 (periscope telephoto)</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 (ultrawide)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 4</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.9 (ultrawide)</p></td><td  ></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>12 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68/ IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP68</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0</p></td><td  ><p>5G (sub-6GHz, mmWave), Wi-Fi 7, UWB, Bluetooth 6.0, eSIM only (in U.S.)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>60W, Qi 2.2 Magnetic Compatibility w/ 25W wireless speeds</p></td><td  ><p>45W wired, 25W wireless Qi2 (Pixelsnap)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 77.9 x 7.8 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8.5 w/ Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra might not see much of an improvement in terms of battery capacity since it's rumored to slim down. I'll be happy if Samsung manages to retain the current 5,000mAh capacity. Charging speeds might finally breach the 45W mark, though, if this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-reveals-a-slimmer-beast-with-blazing-fast-charging" target="_blank">rumor from July</a> turns out to be true. We could be looking at 60W wired charging speeds just for the Ultra model. The S26 Ultra will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-qi2-magnetic-charging">support Qi2 charging</a>, but whether this will be native or via a case remains to be seen.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is actually the only phone in the series to support <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi 2.2 or Qi 25W</a> fast charging. It has a 5,200mAh battery, which helps it last up to 90 minutes more than the Pixel 9 Pro XL. One thing worth noting is that Google will forcibly throttle charging speeds beyond 200 charge cycles, via its new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10s-battery-takes-a-hit-after-200-cycles-courtesy-of-a-feature-you-cant-switch-off">Battery Health Assistance</a> feature.

The latter has a tendency to mess up at times, as even blurred text in extreme zoom shots is made clearer, but the result is often gibberish since there's no way for the AI to know what the original text said in the first place.</p><p>Our Senior Editor, Nicholas Sutrich, noticed this "overconfident hallucination" of the AI zoom feature when trying to improve clarity of other aspects, too, like textures on objects.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> finally got a higher resolution ultrawide camera, but Samsung just might keep all the sensors the same for the next generation.

The telephoto camera system is also among the best, thanks to the dual zoom lenses.</p><p>We might just see some new software or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI features</a> in the camera app. Whether this will be bound to the new Snapdragon SoC in the S26 Ultra or if it will trickle down to older models too remains to be seen.

But if you'll be spending more than $1,000 anyway, I'd happily pay those few extra bucks for the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>One of the major reasons for this is the expected slimmer and lighter design that should make it much easier to live with. Even if you're not big on the stylus, the lighter design and way faster processor are two big reasons why you should choose the S26 Ultra over the Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best Android phones</a> in the market, and will be in 2026. But despite the high cost, you'll still have to settle for a SoC that struggles to compete with its peers, the weird restrictions on charging beyond a certain point, and a display that's still not exactly eye-friendly. The Galaxy S26 Ultra should address all these shortcomings while matching Google in software update longevity.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="4fcfb2f7-172a-43a9-9444-78f045b34935">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RwtaJvqMJgDvj7Axd9tSn9.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra leaked render - square"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future</strong></em></p><p>While we wait for Samsung to unveil what the Galaxy S26 Ultra will bring, the rumors and leaks paint an interesting picture.

Maono promises up to 30 hours of battery life with the lavalier mic kit. The pairing process is hassle-free; you plug the transmitter into your phone, take the mics out of the charging case, and everything is set up.</p><p>Each mic comes with a magnetic back, so you can attach it to clothes, metal surfaces, or any of the accessories in the kit. Two magnetic necklaces, two magnetic clips, and two extra magnets are provided.

When EarFun sent me their open-ear earbuds called the EarFun Clip, it was a totally new genre of wireless audio accessories for me. Feeling the wind in your ear canal while jamming to tunes or listening to a podcast was odd at first, but also felt very freeing.</p><p>Having said that, I've been using these buds for about a month, and I can finally see the merit in them now. Here's how my testing went down, and how I felt about these <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open-ear earbuds</a> afterwards.</p><h2 id="if-you-re-touch-averse-you-re-going-to-dig-these-2">If you're touch averse, you're going to dig these</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FEpbVSrR5yfR9SFonSkVZf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-2" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FEpbVSrR5yfR9SFonSkVZf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bvy3M62P2WdBGcMzZWiEZf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-4" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bvy3M62P2WdBGcMzZWiEZf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Countless individuals have told me time and time again that they don't like the intrusive nature of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">in-ear wireless earbuds</a>. I'd recommend the EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds to them in a heartbeat. The design of these buds is truly unique. They're lightweight, allow your ears to breathe, and play nice if you have a million piercings like me.</p><p>I tried working out with them, and they don't budge. Furthermore, going for a run or a jog outdoors by yourself requires you to be conscious of your surroundings. The sounds of cars, people passing by, and other background noises are easily heard, yet they blend in with the audio playback very smoothly. It's almost like you have tiny Bluetooth speakers in your ears.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2158px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Qngmap54tte3cP6cEuih9H" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-ear-shots-1" alt="EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qngmap54tte3cP6cEuih9H.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2158" height="1214" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2989px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-ear-shots-2" alt="EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Au4bqA9SCDYzByH5PpBxAH.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2989" height="1681" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Physical buttons for controls and clear labelling of right and left buds are additional touches that I appreciate. They are easier to use and navigate, especially when exercising.</p><p>The battery life is fantastic, too. You get a total of 40 hours, including the carrying case and 10 hours in one go on the buds themselves. A quick 10-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback. There's no wireless charging, however.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7CaeAjECHxfyfBCkWFmDZf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-7" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7CaeAjECHxfyfBCkWFmDZf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The EarFun app is helpful as ever. You can switch between modes such as the Game Mode for low latency, the Theater Mode for more immersive audio, and the Privacy Mode that controls the spillage of sound from the open-ear buds.</p><p>The buttons are also customizable, and there's a highly adjustable equalizer in the app as well. You can choose from over 20 audio presets or customize your preferred sound profile entirely at a microscopic level.</p><p>There's even an option to find your earbuds individually via the app, ringing either the left or the right bud depending on which one you've misplaced.</p><h2 id="there-are-some-caveats-of-the-earfun-clip-open-ear-earbuds-2">There are some caveats of the EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="tBpbxxx4sH8AgVcqz3fq7J" name="earfun-clip-app-screenshots-2" alt="EarFun Clip open ear earbuds app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tBpbxxx4sH8AgVcqz3fq7J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4320" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.00%;"><img id="8UnkkNeB4rujWL9hpLrs4J" name="earfun-clip-app-screenshots-1" alt="EarFun Clip open ear earbuds app screenshots" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnkkNeB4rujWL9hpLrs4J.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4320" height="2376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>If you plan on using dual-device connection, you'll have to disable the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">high-quality LDAC codec</a> to ensure a smooth connection. This is a bummer, but it's a bandwidth limitation that all earbuds with multi-point connection face. You can't connect two devices to the EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone">hi-res audio</a> option is enabled. Switching between these modes forces the earbuds to reboot every single time, which gets annoying.</p><p>Another drawback of these earbuds is the leakage. If you're blasting something, be prepared for everyone in close proximity to hear whatever it is that your earbuds are delivering into your ears. While this can be managed by enabling the Privacy Mode and turning down the volume, it takes away from the listening experience.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZJcFuQc9MMuRm6xyGYeMVf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-3" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZJcFuQc9MMuRm6xyGYeMVf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DsEtToo7xMQB59j3Z3GhQf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-6" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DsEtToo7xMQB59j3Z3GhQf.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>With an open-ear concept like this, I assume the logistics of incorporating mics into the buds must have been a taxing endeavor. There are two mics with AI noise cancellation onboard, but when you speak quietly, the audio sounds a little muffled. I had to speak up when taking calls with the EarFun Clip in noisier surroundings.</p><p>I also fully expected the EarFun Clip open-ear buds to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Bluetooth Auracast</a> support, seeing as they come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/bluetooth-6">Bluetooth 6</a>. Perhaps the cost would have increased if they did; I'm not entirely sure why it's missing, even though the hardware is all there. EarFun did not expand on this decision much.</p><h2 id="should-you-buy-them-2">Should you buy them?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5whhYhKpxFn96tGGgLoDTf" name="EarFun-Clip-open-ear-earbuds-lifestyle-1" alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5whhYhKpxFn96tGGgLoDTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For a retail price of $69.99, EarFun filled these buds to the brim with premium specs.

EarFun drops frequent discounts on these, so you can easily score 20% to 30% off if you time your purchase right.</p><p>Alternatives like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Moto Buds Loop</a> cost twice as much, whereas cheaper competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/soundpeats-pearlclip-pro-unlike-anything-i-used-before">SoundPeats PearlClip Pro</a> miss out on flagship features like hi-res audio, robust ingress protection, and battery longevity.</p><p>Whether you get a discount or not, if you're looking to get an affordable pair of open-ear earbuds, the EarFun Clip are a great entry point into this segment.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="5717fee4-b0c7-49a3-bbb4-c3fd69df148e">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o5MAnWiUeSBbq7HAcVDBAL.jpg' alt="EarFun Clip Open Ear Earbuds"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="80" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Open your mind to this</strong></em></p><p>The EarFun Clip open-ear earbuds are wonderfully comfortable, clipping on like earrings rather than regular in-ear earbuds that require insertion.

If you're a lover of the Gen Z maximalist trend, mixing Y2K designs with modernity in your phone cases, power banks, grips, and other accessories, you now have an alternative to CASETiFY.</p><p>Looking at the types of cases that both brands offer, I couldn't help but wonder if BURGA is the new CASETiFY. But after trying out many of BURGA's accessories and comparing what both brands have to offer, I can confidently say that they aren't clones.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

BURGA even has matching tumblers, AirPod cases, and things like yoga mats, which is wild. Clearly, they take matching seriously, and I'm all for it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-google-pixel-10-pro-cases">Google Pixel 10 Pro Case</a> has dual-layered protection, raised bezels, and a glossy finish. What's really cool is you can either use both layers or just snap on the first layer for a thinner, lighter fit. Of course, the shock-absorbing is better with both layers on. I only wish these cases were MagSafe- or Qi2-compatible.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RvzoVmATiSACn4tdx5cZ2F" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-4" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvzoVmATiSACn4tdx5cZ2F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Magnetic Ring Holder and 5,000mAh Magnetic Power Bank both snap onto the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-review">Pixel 10</a> thanks to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-pixelsnap-hands-on">Pixelsnap</a> on the latest Google phones. With the case on, however, you'll need to buy an adapter ring separately and stick it onto the rear for compatibility.</p><p>I ended up using the spinning ring and power bank with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://row.mous.co/collections/pixel-10-pro-cases/products/super-thin_magsafe_phone_case-clear">Pixelsnap-compatible Mous Super Thin Case</a> instead, as I wasn't keen on dirtying the cool Lemon Tart pattern that BURGA sent me. The ring holder is quite nice; it spins a full 360 degrees and has a flat bit so it can be used as a stand in landscape orientation. Unlike the base of the ring holder, the ring itself isn't metal,  so I am not sure about longevity. This does make it very light, however.</p><p>The Magnetic Power Bank works as it should, snapping on magnetically and wirelessly charging the Pixel 10. It has LED lights to indicate the battery level. You can choose from 5,000mAh, 10,000mAh, and 15,000mAh options, as well as several color patterns and customizations, when buying the power bank.

CASETiFY has several similar options with sticky suction cups at the back, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casetify.com/product/snappy-snap-and-stick-grip-stand">Snappy Snap & Grip Stick Grip Stand</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.casetify.com/product/the-stick-it-case">Stick-It Case</a>, but they're all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe accessories</a> or built into phone cases.</p><p>It's a different story with the StickPad, however. This thing works with any phone as long as you have a smooth surface that is conducive to suction. Any BURGA case works really well with the StickPad. There are suction cups on the front and the back of the pad, rather than a magnetic ring on one side.</p><p>And if you noticed how dusty the BURGA StickPad was in the pictures, here's a fun fact: it's washable!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:562px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="BNUZbzyaUWJXoiKhBe9kEe" name="BURGA-StickPad-washing-with-water" alt="Washing the BURGA StickPad in running water in a sink." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNUZbzyaUWJXoiKhBe9kEe.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="562" height="316" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So if you feel like your StickPad has gotten dusty and the suction isn't working as well as it should, you can just wash it with water.</p><p>The StickPad is such a fun concept, and at $19.95, it's also super affordable. You don't need to carry a tripod around or try to find a good place to set your phone down for shooting pictures or videos in public. Just slap the suction cups onto something smooth, like a pole, a door, a whiteboard, or even a smooth wall.</p><p>Since the StickPad just uses suction cups on both sides, any of your friends can borrow it regardless of MagSafe or Qi2 compatibility. It's great for impromptu photos or videos when you're out and about. Capturing group photos and recording fit checks was so much easier with this in my purse!</p><h2 id="my-final-thoughts-on-burga-2">My final thoughts on BURGA</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3830px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="dTWuhTj8UNtnnGyt75GusE" name="BURGA-pixel-10-accessories-lifestyle-1" alt="BURGA accessories for Google Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dTWuhTj8UNtnnGyt75GusE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3830" height="2154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>BURGA is exceedingly stypish across the board, but the pricing on a lot of its products matches or even surpasses CASETiFY. Undoubtedly, the quality is great, and the designs are unusual. There's a wide variety of styles and patterns, even though there aren't any brand collabs like the ones CASETiFY frequently does.</p><p>Clearly, BURGA's offerings are more lifestyle-focused, with products like sunglasses, tumblers, and yoga mats, as well as phone/tablet accessories such as cases, grips, holders, power banks, wireless chargers, watch bands, earbud cases, and screen protectors.</p><p>CASETiFY, on the other hand, is entirely focused on tech, offering all the phone accessories that BURGA offers and more, but not lifestyle items like tumblers. It also has a much wider range of designs and textures to choose from.</p><p>It's nice to see more and more phone accessory brands come up with fun options instead of the usual boring clear cases or monochrome options. I hope that this encourages others in the accessory space to do the same, but hopefully at a lower price point.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To top things off, Google recently refreshed the Pixel Buds Pro 2 with a new Moonstone colorway and a few new features. It's a great time to be in the market for a pair of Pixel Buds as a result, but which model should you buy?</p><p>The company hasn't made it easy, because both the Pixel Buds 2a and the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds with strong value propositions. Of the two, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are unsurprisingly the better option, with crisper sound, stronger ANC, and all the features. The Pixel Buds 2a tries to hit all the basics, including ANC and solid sound, while priced competitively at $129.</p><p>There are key differences to know before choosing, so let's compare the Pixel Buds 2a against the Pixel Buds Pro 2.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-buds-2a-vs-pixel-buds-pro-2-design-and-fit-2">Google Pixel Buds 2a vs. Pixel Buds Pro 2: Design and fit</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EXbwmYUEuR83CgFZnh7tqi" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-2a-vs-Pro-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a compared." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EXbwmYUEuR83CgFZnh7tqi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> deviated from the Pixel Buds A-series design, ditching the wingtip design in favor of a silicone stabilizer. This made the Pixel Buds Pro 2 tiny and secure, without a large wingtip in the mix. Now, the new Pixel Buds 2a borrow the Pixel Buds Pro 2's general design.</p><p>This reduces the overall footprint and improves comfort by removing the wingtip. Like the Pixel Buds Pro 2, the cheaper <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-2a-review">Pixel Buds 2a</a> have a silicone stabilizer with four sizes of ear tips included. There are tiny design differences between models, with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 appearing slightly smaller.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qAKptxvnqtHaczJYPvrVCM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-2a-review-6" alt="The Google Pixel Buds 2a in the Iris colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qAKptxvnqtHaczJYPvrVCM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have a tiny "G" logo carved into their plastic surface, whereas the Pixel Buds 2a logo is flat and painted. The main portion of the earbud is glossy on the Buds 2a and matte on the Buds Pro 2. Only the Pixel Buds 2a are completely colored — the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will sport a matte black finish apart from the outward-facing portion of the earbuds.</p><p>These are purely superficial design differences. In terms of fit, both the Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a will feel comfortable for those who prefer small earbuds. Without a stem, neither earbud will gravitate toward falling out of your ears. At 4.7 grams each, there's no weight difference between these pairs of Google earbuds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fRmh8mVSbSL8khnBkfkuWD" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-6" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fRmh8mVSbSL8khnBkfkuWD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A neat trick that'll help you find the perfect fit is to insert the buds and rotate them until the "G" logo is upright. When it's aligned straight, you know either the Pixel Buds 2a or Pixel Buds Pro 2 are fitted correctly. Both earbuds also support an ear tip seal check that will use a software test to determine whether you're using the right size ear tip.</p><p>Compared to older models like the Pixel Buds A-series, the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 should be more comfortable and secure for most people. However, the difference between the Buds 2a and Buds Pro 2 will feel minuscule, if noticeable at all.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-buds-2a-vs-pixel-buds-pro-2-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel Buds 2a vs. Pixel Buds Pro 2: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-2" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gZULkSsJYweAjdoMSeh8xM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On paper, the Pixel Buds 2a and Pixel Buds Pro 2 look surprisingly similar. Both earbuds have custom 11mm dynamic speaker drivers and the Google Tensor A1 chip for audio and active noise-canceling (ANC) processing. They each have capacitive touch sensors, an IR proximity sensor for automatic play and pause, and Hall effect sensors in the case.</p><p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 separate themselves by adding swipe support for on-earbud volume control, an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a case speaker.</p><p>The case also supports wireless charging and is noticeably taller than the Pixel Buds 2a case. That's likely because the Pixel Buds Pro 2 case has a larger battery, supporting up to 48 hours of total listening time with the case and earbuds with ANC off.</p><div ><table><caption>Specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Buds 2a</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel Buds Pro 2</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Audio</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Custom-designed 11 mm dynamic speaker drivers</p></td><td  ><p>Custom-designed 11 mm dynamic speaker drivers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Processor</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor A1</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor A1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Active noise-canceling (ANC)</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5, Transparency mode, Active in-ear pressure relief</p></td><td  ><p>Active Noise Cancellation with Silent Seal 2.0, Transparency mode, Active in-ear pressure relief</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Case speaker</strong></p></td><td  ><p>N/A, earbuds can play ringtone</p></td><td  ><p>Ringtone speaker for Find Hub</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Microphones</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Two microphones per earbud</p></td><td  ><p>Three microphones per earbud</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Sensors</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive touch (tap) sensors for music, calls, and voice assistant controls, IR proximity sensor for in-ear detection to play and pause automatically, Hall Effect sensor for case open and close detection</p></td><td  ><p>Capacitive touch (tap and swipe) sensors for music, calls, and voice assistant controls, IR proximity sensor for in-ear detection to play and pause automatically, Motion-detecting accelerometer and gyroscope, Hall Effect sensor for case open and close detection</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Charging</strong></p></td><td  ><p>USB-C</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Battery life</strong></p></td><td  ><p>Up to 7 hours with ANC on (earbuds) and up to 20 hours with ANC earbuds (including charging case)</p></td><td  ><p>Up to 8 hours with ANC on (earbuds) and up to 30 hours with ANC earbuds (including charging case)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Dimensions</strong></p></td><td  ><p>23.1 mm x 16.0 mm x 17.8 mm (each earbud), 50.0 mm x 24.5 mm x 57.2 mm (charging case)</p></td><td  ><p>25.0 mm x 49.9 mm x 63.3 mm (each earbud), 49.9 mm x 63.3 mm x 25.00 mm<br> (charging case)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Weight</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4.7g (each earbud), 47.6g (case including earbuds)</p></td><td  ><p>4.7g (each earbud), 65.0g (case including earbuds)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Although both earbuds have the Tensor A1 chip, that only tells part of the story.

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 will block even more sound than the Buds 2a, handling a pressurized airplane cabin, a loud coffee shop, or a busy street without issue. The Pixel Buds 2a will do their best, and it's usually good enough when music is playing. Still, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 clearly have an edge.</p><p>The lack of Adaptive Audio on the Pixel Buds 2a isn't a dealbreaker for me, because I mostly use stock ANC or transparency modes anyway. If you use your buds similarly, you won't need to splurge on the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for that feature.</p><p>Sound quality is pretty great on the Pixel Buds 2a, as long as you don't listen to them at the maximum volume setting. At low and midrange volumes, these earbuds have decent balance with a bass that makes its presence felt without overpowering mids and highs. That starts to change near max volume, where the soundstage starts to blur and the sound becomes muddied.</p><p>Everything sounds crisper on the Pixel Buds Pro 2, especially at high volumes. The earbuds manage to provide detailed reproduction and separation of songs across genres, and the sound is customizable across a five-band EQ. Put simply, if you need the best sound quality, Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the definitive option from Google.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-buds-2a-vs-pixel-buds-pro-2-which-should-you-buy-2">Google Pixel Buds 2a vs. Pixel Buds Pro 2: Which should you buy?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5mUg33pYpPD3x9oazUy2wh" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-2a-vs-Pro-1" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 and Pixel Buds 2a compared." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5mUg33pYpPD3x9oazUy2wh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 are the complete package, with major perks like better sound quality that shines with crispness all the way up to maximum volume. There's better active noise-canceling and exclusive modes like Adaptive Audio, too. You even get nice-to-have features built in, such as a case speaker for Find My Device, wireless charging support, and on-earbud volume control.</p><p>At the right price, they're nearly impossible to beat among the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">best wireless earbuds</a>. It's not hard to find the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for under $200 — at the time of publishing, they're just under that threshold at Best Buy. We've seen more aggressive sales around deal holidays, and expect to see the same when Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around.</p><p>If you can wait, snagging the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for around $150 would be a better value than buying the Pixel Buds 2a at full price. The cheaper buds do nail the essentials, but at $129, they're too close to the price of higher-quality earbuds — especially when the latter are on sale. The Pixel Buds 2a are a solid set of earbuds, although you should probably wait for a sale if you want the best value.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fd1e1a0e-3190-4c1d-b2b6-24c57d64e759">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XjUgmALQdnCYSXchBh74Zb.jpg' alt="The Google Pixel Buds 2a in Iris."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel Buds 2a</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Only the basics</strong></em></p><p>The Google Pixel Buds 2a are the perfect budget earbuds for Pixel owners.

Samsung removed this feature due to very low usage, and it's unlikely it will add it back in its upcoming flagship.</p></article></section><h2 id="how-many-people-actually-care-about-bluetooth-in-the-s-pen-2">How many people actually care about Bluetooth in the S Pen?</h2><p>As it turns out, not many. According to usage data obtained by Samsung, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-removed-air-actions-from-galaxy-s25-ultra-s-pen-but-who-cares">less than 1% of users actually cared about Bluetooth</a> in the S Pen, so unless that number went up in the last year (which is unlikely), we can confidently deduce that Samsung won't be adding this feature to the S Pen in the Galaxy S26 Ultra. The main feature to be removed from the S Pen by ditching Bluetooth is Air Actions, which lets you snap a picture using the S Pen's button as a shutter release or flick gestures to interact with the phone.</p><p>One thing we do know is that the S Pen in the Galaxy S26 Ultra will likely get a slight redesign to blend with the phone's new curvy shape. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves" target="_blank">leak </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-ultra-s-pen-might-ditch-the-boxy-look-for-softer-curves" target="_blank">from September</a> 2025 shows a close-up of the purported S26 Ultra, where the new, curvy S Pen head can be seen in a partially ejected state. This also leans into the theory that the S26 Ultra will ditch the boxy design for more gentle curves like the rest of the series.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW" name="galaxy-s26-ultra-renders-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A9GqkkimZwh3f7Z2iYn7iW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is said to shake up the entire <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">S26 series</a> with the Galaxy S26 presumably being rebranded as the S26 Pro.

Modern models are supported for seven years with Android OS upgrades and security patches, giving buyers peace of mind. Their device will likely remain supported longer than they'll continue to use it, but Samsung's software support wasn't always this way.</p><p>Samsung's software support window was much shorter, especially for budget and midrange devices, not too long ago. As such, some fairly recent phones are running out of time, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE</a>. It released in 2020, and just turned five years old this month. That means Samsung fulfilled its initial promise of five years of security updates for the Galaxy S20 FE (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/time-to-say-goodbye-to-galaxy-s20-fe-after-5-amazing-years/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).</p><p>The Galaxy S20 FE recently received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-z-fold-7-and-flip-7-owners-are-finally-seeing-a-crucial-october-2025-patch">October 2025 security patch</a>, but it's likely this month's update will be its final one. Currently, the Galaxy S20 FE is still named on Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb" target="_blank">security update support list</a> as receiving quarterly patches. Now that the smartphone is over five years old, it's due for removal soon.</p><p>While the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is currently up-to-date, it'll become more vulnerable to security issues over time without active patches.

The company has been working on Beam, a 3D video communication platform, for more than half a decade — it first showed off the technology in 2021 as "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-project-starline-astra-ar-glasses">Project Starline</a>," which was in the works for "a few years" before that. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/project-starline-is-now-google-beam-but-whats-new-i-tried-it-to-find-out">Google Beam</a> began popping up in real-world use cases shortly after Google I/O 2025, powered by HP hardware.</p><p>Now, Google is sharing how it is partnering with United Service Organizations (USO) to bring Google Beam to the military community. It's starting out as a pilot program next year, and it'll bring Beam technology to USO centers at home and abroad.</p><p>"For our nation's active duty service members, separation from family during long deployments means missing out on some important moments and milestones," the company wrote in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-beam-uso-partnership/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><div><blockquote><p>"Now, through our pilot program, deployed service members will have the opportunity to feel closer to their families for moments big and small — whether joining a Beam call to wish a family member happy birthday or reading a favorite book to their child and feeling like they’re together in the same room."</p><p>Google</p></blockquote></div><p>Google Beam is the AI-powered software that makes realistic three-dimensional video calls possible, and it requires specialized hardware to function. HP is the only partner making Beam hardware, and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/hp-dimension.html" target="_blank">HP Dimension</a> interface costs $25,000 per unit.

But don't get too excited. This isn't the big, flashy Wear OS 6 and Android 16 upgrade that landed on the Pixel Watch 2 and 3 earlier this month.</p><p>This is its final, guaranteed farewell.</p><p>Google is pushing build BW1A.251005.003.W1 to the first-gen watch, and it’s a minor patch. This update keeps the device on Wear OS 5.1, which is based on Android 15. The official <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googlepixelwatch/thread/383537227/pixel-watch-1-update-october-2025" target="_blank">release notes</a> are brief, mentioning only “Security updates and bug fixes" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/27/pixel-watch-october-update/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>This makes it clear that the original Pixel Watch won’t be moving up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, a privilege reserved for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">newer smartwatch models</a>. Launched back in October 2022, the first-gen Pixel Watch was Google’s re-entry into the smartwatch market, built on a Samsung Exynos 9110 chip and running Wear OS 3.5 at launch.</p><h2 id="support-window-closed-2">Support window closed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past three years, it received multiple updates that improved performance and battery management, as well as two major version upgrades — from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4, and then to 5.1. With this latest patch, Google is effectively closing the book on major system updates for the device.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t abandoning the watch entirely. Users will still receive app and service updates through the Play Store, ensuring that essential functions remain usable for a while longer. But when it comes to full Wear OS upgrades and long-term improvements, this is the finish line.</p><p>If you’re still wearing the first-gen Pixel Watch, it’s recommended to install the October patch once it hits your device. You can check for it manually by heading to Settings → System → System Updates on your watch. It’s a relatively small update, but an important one for maintaining stability and security.</p><p>And while it’s bittersweet to see support end, the Pixel Watch has had a solid run: three years of updates and consistent improvements. From here on out, it’ll continue to work fine, but without the major Wear OS upgrades that the newer Pixel Watch lineup will enjoy.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Xiaomi joins Google and Samsung as one of the first major brands to offer a stable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a> update.</p><p>HyperOS 3 is more than just a visual update.

Xiaomi has confirmed that the Xiaomi 15, 15 Pro, 15 Ultra, Redmi Note 14 series, Poco F7 and X7, and Xiaomi Pad 7 will also get the update.</p><p>These models should get the update in the next few weeks. Older flagships like the Xiaomi 14 and Poco F6 series are expected to follow around late November. Since the rollout is happening in stages, it may take some time to reach every region.</p><p>A full list of eligible devices confirms just how wide the rollout will go. On the Xiaomi side, everything from the 15-series flagships down to the Pad 6 Pro, Pad 6 Max 14, and even the Pad Mini are included. The Redmi lineup covers popular models like the K80 and K70 series, along with the Note 15, Note 14, Turbo 4, and A-series devices.</p><p>Poco users aren’t left out either — the F7, F7 Pro, X7 Pro, M7 Plus, and several <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget-friendly models</a> will all get the Android 16-based HyperOS 3 update in due time.</p><p>With HyperOS 3 now officially out in the wild, it’s clear Xiaomi is stepping up its software game and setting the pace for what Android 16 will look like on non-Pixel phones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The original poster simply posted a screenshot of the update's changelog appearing on their Galaxy devices earlier today (in the U.S. on Oct 27). This update appears to be available for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro-review">Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro</a>, bearing v<strong>R53</strong>0XXU0AYJ1 and v<strong>R63</strong>0XXU0AYJ1, respectively, per the publication.</p><p>Per the user's screenshot, the update doesn't seem to be that large, as their changelog only cites a 7.30MB download for the buds.</p><p>The machine-translated photo states that Samsung is only bringing bug fixes, courtesy of its "apply stabilization code" highlight. These updates typically begin in South Korea for Samsung's home consumers first, before bringing it to other regions. With that, it's likely we could see the patch appear in the U.S. later this week or next week.</p><p>The publication informs users that, with One UI 8, you will have to connect your buds to your Galaxy phone before you can initiate the update in your Settings app.</p><h2 id="the-buds-are-staying-up-to-date-2">The Buds are staying up to date</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-one-ui-8-beta-1-auracast" alt="Using a pair of Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to connect to an Auracast stream running on One UI 8 on a Samsnug Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aLUy8iuHciU2NHQBpkHwui.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While we're always looking to the "next big thing" from Samsung's software patches, One UI 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-reveals-what-galaxy-buds-3-series-users-can-expect-out-of-one-ui-7">already brought a host of features</a> to the Buds 3 and 3 Pro. One of the major highlights was that the Buds 3 series received a more "intelligent" audio experience that can "analyze" your surroundings to fine-tune your sound. As your surroundings change, your Buds will automatically become louder or quieter to ensure you can hear every note.</p><p>On a similar note, the Buds 3 series also features an "advanced hearing test." This is the personalization side, as the software can create a sound profile tuned to your hearing. This is an alternative to the earbuds' standard audio profiles that you can pick at your leisure.</p><p>What we might have to look forward to is One UI 8.5, which Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/ui-8-5-beta-program-for-samsung-galaxy-late-this-fall-rumored">has reportedly been testing internally</a>. There were some rumors earlier this month that claimed it was looking to start a beta for the next software, but nothing's confirmed yet. All we have is speculation, and those theories suggest One UI 8.5 could be quite an extensive update, packed with loads of new features. Additionally, one test build that was spotted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/amid-one-ui-8-5-leaks-alleged-galaxy-buds-4-pro-testing-begins-rumor">seemingly mentioned the Galaxy Buds 4</a>.</p><p>If we're getting excited, then <em>maybe </em>this update brings something for the current earbud series once it launches, which some reports say could be with the Galaxy S26.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, unlike the Mate XT that folds outward and inward, the Galaxy Z TriFold will use a U-shaped mechanism — meaning both outer folding screens will fold inward, as seen in the video below.</p><h2 id="a-first-look-at-how-the-galaxy-z-trifold-actually-folds-2">A first look at how the Galaxy Z TriFold actually folds</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.00%;"><img id="pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-4" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pqMoqKxXFd7xQM8VKZJAJT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="427" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.43%;"><img id="fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-1" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fcAn29fRoZ7ED5ymK2HCJT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="381" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.57%;"><img id="4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-2" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4YTUmzQojfurFJVYsUyJHT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="354" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.29%;"><img id="Gm3eL5B7ky2BTGJJHpuzJT" name="galaxy-z-trifold-first-look-3" alt="First look at Galaxy Z TriFold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gm3eL5B7ky2BTGJJHpuzJT.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="436" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Dailian)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As for specs, Samsung's trifolding phone will feature a 10-inch display when fully unfolded and a 6.5-inch cover display.

While the renders don't reveal much, they show that Samsung's trifold continues the company's design language and looks quite similar to the Galaxy Z Fold 7. The renders also show a selfie camera on both the inner and outer displays, though the bezels appear slightly thicker.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"> pic.twitter.com/MLRXg3a74U<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1983022046738297275">October 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Samsung hasn't confirmed when it plans to officially unveil the device, but rumors suggest it could debut <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/news-weekly-sept-20-2025">as soon as next month</a>.

Samsung was rumored to revamp the lineup by rebranding the base Galaxy S26 as the Galaxy S26 Pro and replacing the Galaxy S26 Plus with a slimmer Galaxy S26 Edge — the supposed successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-hands-on">Galaxy S25 Edge</a>.

And now, restarting development of the Galaxy S26 Plus just months before launch seems to have affected the company's schedule, which in turn seems to have delayed the One UI 8.5 beta as well.</p><p>Samsung had regained momentum lost during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsungs-one-ui-7-finally-resumes-again-expanding-to-more-regions-including-india">One UI 7's slow rollout</a> with the timely release of One UI 8 across several Galaxy devices, but this new roadblock could impact the rollout of One UI 8.5.</p><p>It's still not confirmed whether the beta will be delayed, so there's some hope.

The incident has stirred understandable concern among Galaxy users, especially since it echoes memories of the infamous Galaxy Note 7 fiasco nearly a decade ago.</p><p>According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-s/%EC%86%90%EC%97%90-%EB%93%A4%EA%B3%A0-%EC%9E%88%EB%8D%98-s25-%EA%B3%A0%EC%97%B4-%EB%B0%9C%EC%83%9D-%ED%9B%84-%ED%99%94%EC%9E%AC-%EC%B6%A9%EC%A0%84%EC%A4%91-%EC%95%84%EB%8B%98/td-p/35569588" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung Korea's forum page, the owner of the Galaxy S25 Plus noticed the device heating up unusually while in use. Moments later, the phone emitted a loud pop, was dropped to the floor, and burst into flames.</p><p>Fortunately, no injuries were reported, but the device was left completely destroyed. The user took the charred remains to a Samsung Service Center in South Korea, where the company has since begun an internal inspection to determine what went wrong.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:482px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:180.50%;"><img id="mbHy5GdV9mDxuy6JuAF2p9" name="Galaxy-S25-Plus-burned" alt="a burned Galaxy S25 Plus with its back panel peeled off" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mbHy5GdV9mDxuy6JuAF2p9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="482" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Cheoeuijan-ah / Samsung Korea)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One important detail is that the phone was not plugged in when the fire started. This makes people wonder if the problem is more than just a charging issue. It could be a faulty battery, too much heat from apps running in the background, or a problem with how the new hardware handles heat.</p><h2 id="it-s-not-the-first-heat-complaint-2">It's not the first heat complaint</h2><p>The Galaxy S25 series is powered by Samsung’s latest Exynos 2500 or Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chipsets, both known for their performance, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS25/comments/1lb9ion/my_galaxy_s25_is_constantly_warm_and_nobody_at/" target="_blank">early user reports</a> have also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/galaxy-s25-series/brand-new-s25-overheating/td-p/11707208" target="_blank">mentioned</a> higher-than-usual operating temperatures under load.</p><p>As of now, Samsung hasn’t issued any official statement, suggesting this may be an isolated case. However, the company is expected to run extensive diagnostics to rule out broader safety concerns.</p><p>The Galaxy S25 Plus fire may turn out to be a one-off manufacturing defect, but for a device carrying Samsung’s flagship badge, even a single case like this is enough to raise eyebrows. Until the company’s investigation concludes, Galaxy S25 owners might want to keep an eye on their phone’s temperature, just to be safe.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The S-series smartphones have always packed in the best hardware in the business, and the Galaxy S25 Plus is no different.

Compared to the last-gen model, it claims to deliver a jump of up to 25% in single-core performance and a boost of up to 20% in multi-core workloads. You can also expect some solid gains in gaming and AI workflows.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning here that Samsung might revert to a dual-chipset approach with the Galaxy S26 line-up, with its upcoming flagships using a homegrown SoC, the Exynos 2600, in some markets. And it might actually be a good thing this time around, as a recent report <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">claims that the new chipset will pack some serious punch</a>, with performance that might put it in the same league as the freshest SoCs from Qualcomm and Apple.</p><p>It goes without saying that the Galaxy S26 Plus will likely come with all the usual connectivity and I/O options, including Wi-Fi 7, multi-band 5G, and USB Type-C 3.2 with DisplayPort functionality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.70%;"><img id="rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rcJq6g3FrXH6vabXiVUcvD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4037" height="2289" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As fantastic as all that is, newer hardware shouldn't be your "only" reason to pick the Galaxy S26 Plus.

The triple-lens system is comprised of a 50MP primary sensor, a 10MP telephoto unit with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide module.</p><p>The setup lets you capture solid photos with lots of detail and dynamic range, and low-light performance is great too. For videos, you get up to 8K recording and Log video capture functionality. Add to it the usual assortment of editing options and AI-based features, and you have a fabulous everyday camera array.</p><p>But even with all that goodness, the camera hardware is exactly the same as it has been over the last multiple generations. According to rumors, this trend is likely to continue with the Galaxy S26 Plus, as it'll carry forward the same triple-lens arrangement yet again, although the 50MP primary sensor might get an update.</p><p>Even so, the new phone might get a better camera performance due to its improved processing, but that's something we'll only be able to test once we get our hands on the Galaxy S26 Plus and we put it through its paces.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.18%;"><img id="pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-render" alt="Galaxy S26 Pro CAD render  showing the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pcsL3p4BL6t3YXc5FTUrcH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="409" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Smartprix)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Talking about software, it's all but certain that the Galaxy S26 Plus and all of its siblings will launch with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.

And while nothing's confirmed yet, the details we have so far point to the Galaxy S26 line-up being a bit more than just another incremental update. So, the real question is, if you've been thinking about getting the Galaxy S25 Plus, should you just buy one or wait for the Galaxy S26 Plus?</p><p>The answer to that question depends on many factors, such as your use case, budget, and how urgently you need a new smartphone. If you're a power user who takes a lot of photos with your smartphone and plan on using your next device for a long time, waiting for the Galaxy S26 Plus makes sense, even if that means having to hold on to your current phone for a bit longer.</p><p>On the other hand, if you need a feature-laden Android flagship that'll last you years and couldn't care less about the latest chipset or the newest collection of AI tools, getting the Galaxy S25 Plus now (or even better, during the festive-season promotions like Black Friday) is the right choice. It has just about everything you could want in a top-of-the-line Android smartphone and will get software support for years to come.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d4efd8d6-d5b2-4b3b-83c3-91705bcc8594">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzkcj8YMqwNYbgHkLXibwc.jpg' alt="The rumored product render of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Pro."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S26 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>New and improved</strong></em></p><p>The upcoming Galaxy S26 Plus is expected to feature Qualcomm's newest top-tier chipset, along with an updated primary camera sensor, a wide assortment of AI-powered tools, and MagSafe support.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3f856b52-3279-4cb6-ab54-67b97154d930">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yWsYJeA9FLGbXsBt6BFQ8T.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus in Silver Shadow official render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Ticks all the boxes</strong></em></p><p>About to be a last-generation model soon, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is still a powerhouse that offers cutting-edge hardware, great cameras, years software support, and a battery that can go all day.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Either way, we do know there will be a 6.3-inch handset arriving just in time to compete with the Google Pixel 10.</p><p>Google recently launched the Pixel 10 series, challenging competitors like Samsung in major ways. Specifically, an upgraded camera system and Qi2 magnets put the ball in Samsung's court to respond with the Galaxy S26. If you're in the market for a base-model Android flagship, you'll likely be choosing between these two phones in a few months.</p><p>Let's preview how the Galaxy S26 will stack up against the Pixel 10 in a speculative comparison, based on the rumors and leaks available.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-s26-vs-google-pixel-10-pricing-and-availability-2">Samsung Galaxy S26 vs. Google Pixel 10: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ" name="Galaxy-S26-Pro-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of Galaxy S26 Pro leak showcasing a slimmer design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZnoxAMJ6w4bpnV5AeZY7AZ.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is expected to debut the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 series</a> sometime early next year.

The current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> starts at $799 and ships with 128GB of storage.

The Galaxy S25 only offered 2,600 nits of brightness, but it's possible Samsung elevates this on the Galaxy S26 to better compete with the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FfWPQLx9aLqno3wu5nuCLf" name="Google-Pixel-10-review-26" alt="Pixel 10 display outside" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfWPQLx9aLqno3wu5nuCLf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 has a glossy back and a pill-shaped camera bar at the top, which protrudes noticeably from the rear.

However, if Samsung were to bump up the price, now would be the time to do so, as we just saw Apple did just that with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>, which launched in September 2025. That said, we don't expect the price increase to exceed another $100, and it may be limited to the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, more recently, we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/when-will-samsung-launch-the-galaxy-s26-one-leaker-claims-itll-be-later-than-usual">rumors and reports</a> surfacing that Samsung might be planning to postpone its first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026">Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026</a>. Making matters worse for those considering an upgrade, it's said that Samsung could wait until March 2026 to unveil the Galaxy S26 lineup. Unfortunately, we aren't sure why this might be the case, but it could have something to do with adding a fourth model to the mix, or it could be preparing to unveil the rumored tri-fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-trifold-may-debut-in-the-us-amid-rumors-of-a-simultaneous-launch-event">Galaxy G Fold</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, the decision is yours, and a lot of it depends on how desperate you are for an upgrade. If the S26 series were rumored to stick to the January announcement schedule, this would be a bit easier to decide, but if it comes in March, you'll be waiting over four months.</p><p>In which case, I'd probably just suggest that you wait until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday/Cyber Monday deals</a> start rolling in and grab the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25 series</a> for less, as they're still very capable phones with plenty of AI to go around and years of software updates ahead.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="1eb2dea9-9201-406c-8319-fc122ea2e66b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7aPuds4bUohAeDeEDRcqi.jpg' alt="samsung galaxy s25 ultra square render"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The price cuts have started</strong></em></p><p>It's that time of the year when retailers and carriers start offering ridiculous deals on a variety of products.

While the bright and flashy colorways might not be for everyone, Google thought of this and made it possible for users to customize their smartwatch's color theme.</p><p>There are 10 total options for personalizing your Pixel Watch's color theme, and this guide will explain them all and how to set them up.</p><h2 id="pixel-watch-themes-and-color-options-2">Pixel Watch themes and color options</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3791px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="RsZ4mhNL5SYHSEHi9j39sj" name="Pixel-Watch-4-pink-theme" alt="A Pixel Watch 4 sitting on a scratch pad showing the Fitbit Quick Start Tile with pink theming for the buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RsZ4mhNL5SYHSEHi9j39sj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3791" height="2133" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wear OS 6 is a major update for the Google Pixel Watch that adds Material 3 Expressive, a fun and colorful design language, to your smartwatch. Material You theming arrives on the Pixel Watch for the first time, giving users fine-tuned control over the entire Wear OS appearance. Customization doesn't stop at the watch face; it extends to buttons, sliders, toggles, and every part of the system.</p><p>There are two basic theming options in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>: <strong>Match watch face</strong> and <strong>No theme</strong>. The former will automatically adjust Material You theming to match your selected watch face when enabled (not that this only applies to first-party watch faces). Every time you change watch faces, an <strong>Applying theme</strong> screen will appear as your Pixel Watch adjusts on its own. As expected, <strong>No theme</strong> simply keeps Wear OS 6 colors as standard.</p><p>Alternatively, you can pick a persistent color theme of one of the following selections:</p><ul><li>Moonstone</li><li>Ivy</li><li>Porcelain</li><li>Iris</li><li>Lemongrass</li><li>Jade</li><li>Indigo</li><li>Peony</li></ul><p>The color options above align with the physical colorways available on Pixel phones and watches.</p><h2 id="how-to-change-your-google-pixel-watch-theme-2">How to change your Google Pixel Watch theme</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="pPxB7ujLKxwvZPW2PiMeo" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-and-Watch-3-Wear-OS-6" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 4 (left) showing the app drawer on display, next to the Pixel Watch 3 showing the Google Maps Tile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pPxB7ujLKxwvZPW2PiMeo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Setting up Material You theming on your Google Pixel Watch only takes a few taps.

It wasn't the best, but it still managed to make it through an entire day, even a year later.</p><p>However, Google's Pixel 10 Pro Fold promised to be even better, thanks to the move to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a> chip. By moving production from Samsung to TSMC, Google hoped its latest chip would be faster and more efficient. And, at least when it comes to efficiency, the 10 Pro Fold has delivered.</p><p>When running a battery test, which consisted of playing a 4K HDR video at full brightness with 50% volume, here's what I found:</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Screen</p></th><th  ><p>Time</p></th><th  ><p>Battery</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Inner</strong></p></td><td  ><p>2:50</p></td><td  ><p>59%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>3:50</p></td><td  ><p>44%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>4:50</p></td><td  ><p>30%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p><strong>Cover</strong></p></td><td  ><p>4:53</p></td><td  ><p>29%</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol empty" ></td><td  ><p>5:53</p></td><td  ><p>20%</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see, with the 8-inch inner display, you're looking at about a 15% drop per hour. Naturally, less battery is consumed when using the cover screen, as the battery dropped by 9%.</p><p>Extrapolating that out, you're looking at about 8 hours with only the inner display, or a little more than 11 with the cover screen. That's been more than enough for me, as I have yet to feel the pinch of needing to find a charger before running out of juice.</p><p>For as great as battery life has been, the same can't be said for performance. Don't get me wrong, in day-to-day life, the 10 Pro Fold has been silky-smooth and keeps up with anything that I'm trying to do.</p><p>Unfortunately, this isn't the case with gaming, specifically emulation. It's reached the point where I don't even bother loading up any intensive games, whether they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-cant-believe-it-theres-actually-a-switch-emulator-on-the-play-store">Switch ROMs</a> or Windows games via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/the-retro-gaming-and-emulation-community-needs-to-take-a-deep-breath">GameHub</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5472px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY" name="hollow-knight-silksong-winlator-pixel-10-pro-fold" alt="Hollow Knight: Silksong via Winlator on Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uRe42W4eMJYigHJzaUzheY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5472" height="3078" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm really not sure what's going on here, but I suspect it has something to do with the Tensor G5's GPU. The performance is so disappointing that Google issued a statement after reports surfaced about issues.</p><p>It appears that the GPU drivers in current Android builds are outdated. In its response, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-promises-gpu-improvements-pixel-10">Google said</a> it plans to include "further GPU driver updates" in "future releases," noting that "the September and October patch releases already contained GPU driver enhancements."</p><p>Sadly, those updates have not yet resulted in meaningful improvements. The next major Android update isn't expected until the December 2025 Pixel Drop. So we'll have to revisit this once the latest GPU drivers are actually released.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-software"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Software</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5244px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-13" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5244" height="2950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><ul><li><strong>Outside Material 3 Expressive, there really aren't many new features to be found on the software side.</strong></li><li><strong>You're still limited to two apps on the inner screen at a time, not even being able to add a floating window. </strong></li></ul><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Related Reviews</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><ul><li><strong></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review" target="_blank"><strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><strong></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review" target="_blank"><strong>Honor Magic V5</strong></a><strong></strong></li><li><strong></strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review" target="_blank"><strong>Vivo X Fold 5</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul></p></div></div><p>This has been one of the more difficult sections to write, as my feelings on Google's software are very different than, say, Samsung's One UI. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, I know there are going to be plenty of settings to fiddle around with, along with more tweaks and changes that I can make in order to enable various features that aren't there out of the box. At the same time, my expectation is to be able to use the Fold 7 for practically anything I need.</p><p>When picking up the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I know there are certain limitations to what's possible, but for some reason, it doesn't bother me. The only other phone that makes me feel this way is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone</a>, as iOS and iPadOS are just way too locked down to really do much outside of what Apple wants me to do.</p><p>I've said this before, but I equate the Pixel 10 Pro Fold (and other Pixels) as being the "weekend phone." It's great for replying to messages, maybe playing a few games, and watching your favorite sports team. But it lacks some of the features that help make other foldables great.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="UZLjL55Z9uC4KddG7K4YkU" name="google-pixel-10-pro-Fold-app-pair" alt="Multitasking on the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold with the new save app pair feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UZLjL55Z9uC4KddG7K4YkU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most notable of which is multitasking, as you're still limited to using only two apps at a time, even on the inner screen. I can't tell you how many times I've swiped up to grab an app from the taskbar, hoping to drag and drop it into a floating window, only to be reminded that it's just not possible.</p><p>Now, I'm not asking for the Samsung approach, where I can fit up to five or six apps on the screen at once. But come on, Google, just give me <em>something</em> more. I mean, it's an 8-inch screen — the same size as some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets" target="_blank">best Android tablets</a> — so there shouldn't be any reason we can't at least have <em>one</em> floating window.</p><div><blockquote><p>On the one hand, Google's multitasking implementation is great.

Google had just introduced a completely new design that was more focused on thinness and a premium look. It was disappointing, but at least it was understandable.</p><p>Unfortunately, that disappointment continues with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as the hardware remains unchanged. To be fair, Google didn't upgrade the physical sensors in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-series-camera-review">Pixel 10 Pro or Pro XL</a>, but the latest foldable doesn't even match up to last year's Pixel 9 Pro.</p><p>As a result, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold yet again misses out on features found with its non-foldable counterparts.

as much of a surprise, but the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is easily the stiffest competition. Samsung made huge changes with this year's release, removing the S Pen digitizer to make the slimmest phone.</p><p>Not only that, Samsung took things further and added the same 200MP primary camera found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. All of these changes came at a cost, however, as Samsung bumped up the price by $100.</p><p>In the U.S., that's pretty much all you get in terms of alternatives, at least if you wanted to walk into your local carrier and walk out with a new phone. In reality, there are actually quite a few formidable opponents, which include the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>.</p><p>The problem is that none of those phones are easily accessible in the U.S., meaning that you'll need to have them imported from abroad. This usually means paying a slight markup, but at least you aren't limited. However, the current political and economic climate is such that, in addition to paying a markup to import a phone, there's a good chance you'll have to pay a tariff on top of it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-pixel-10-pro-fold-should-you-buy-it"><span>Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4468px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="asToP2HuW6Qv2CR3iJG6jn" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-review-hero-21x9-2" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asToP2HuW6Qv2CR3iJG6jn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4468" height="2514" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the first foldable phone with an IP68 rating.</li><li>You don't need a lot of extra bells and whistles.</li><li>You want a foldable phone that works with Pixelsnap (and MagSafe) accessories.</li><li>You need all-day battery life.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if:</strong></p><ul><li>You want the best cameras on a foldable phone.</li><li>You want the slimmest and lightest foldable phone.</li><li>You're on a budget.</li></ul><p>For as much as I would love to tell you that this is <em>the</em> foldable phone for everyone, I just can't.

The company had been teasing its new phone quite a bit lately, and now we know exactly what to expect from the global device's full specifications and features.</p><p>First off, the OnePlus 15 shows up looking a lot different from its predecessor, as we have noted multiple times in previous leaks and teases. It ditches the phone's circular camera bump on its rear panel for a more iPhone-esque camera array, off to the left of the device. The phone comes with a smoother finish and rounded corners, ditching the boxier look of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13.</a></p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.opposhop.cn/cn/web/products/36995.html">Chinese product listing page</a> of the OnePlus 15 notes that it will be powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset. As for the display, it gets a 6.78-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 1.5K resolution and a massive 165Hz refresh rate. It also gets exceptionally thin 1.15mm bezels, giving users more screen space to play with.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="q7tvXG4UWQn9jHGM3mxMjN" name="OnePlus15-SandStorm- edition" alt="OnePlus 15 launches" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q7tvXG4UWQn9jHGM3mxMjN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the OnePlus 15 gets a massive  7,300mAh battery that supports 120W  fast charging and 50W wireless charging. Coming to its camera setup, the phone shows up with three 50MP lenses. This includes a 50MP main camera (with a larger sensor than its predecessor and OIS), a 50MP ultrawide camera, and a 50MP periscope telephoto lens that offers 3.5x optical zoom and OIS. Speaking of ditching, this phone lets go of <strong> </strong>the Alert Slider, which is replaced by a customizable '<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">Plus Key.'</a></p><p>The phone also features a 32MP selfie camera, and it is also shown without the Hasselblad logo, indicating the presence of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax imaging</a> engine, which is said to enhance picture quality.

In a recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.directv.com/dtvassets/pdfs/3780993-2025-emerging-trends.pdf">published document</a>, the satellite TV provider detailed its plan to help hoteliers improve the visitor experience in rooms. To do this, DirecTV highlighted its new "Advanced Entertainment Platform," otherwise known as the AEP.</p><p>The purpose of the AEP, according to DirecTV, is to help "further enhance guest personalization." Additionally, the AEP enables deep-rooted customization opportunities for the hotel, letting them "customize the home screen with a brand's logo, colors, or image, and a custom welcome message."</p><p>As the publication points out, Google TV is at the core of DirecTV's AEP. The TV provider states that its AEP will bring live TV, popular streaming services, and "on-demand content," which is likely driven by Google's experience (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tvs">Android TV OS</a>). The AEP's Partner Program will let hotels "layer" some uniqueness for their guests. As such, the document states that, aside from entertainment, visitors can find a hotel's hours of operation and times for restaurants, spas, gyms, and more using their TV remote.</p><p>Moreover, hotels can leverage the AEP to even showcase menus for dishes served in the building. The post reports that Google TV and DirecTV are eyeing a release of the AEP in hotels sometime in 2026.</p><h2 id="the-tv-experience-continues-to-evolve-2">The TV experience continues to evolve</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1307px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:45.91%;"><img id="Y2kef4qG8eX7r8cyhZGt6C" name="google-tv-directv-aep-hotels-2026" alt="DirecTV's AEP prepares a clean, customizable look for hotels to fully change and provide the entertainment its visitors may enjoy during their stay, with room for a custom logo, certain streaming apps, a unique background, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2kef4qG8eX7r8cyhZGt6C.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1307" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: DirecTV)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The post by 9to5 highlights DirecTV's ambition to let hotel guests attach their Google accounts temporarily to the AEP, Google TV combo. Reportedly, the system will run "daily, automatic clears" for a visitor's information, to ensure the next person to inhabit that room doesn't see anything.</p><p>For more personal spaces, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/gemini-for-google-tv-launches-only-a-few-enjoy-smarter-entertainment">Gemini with Google TV</a> launched in September, bringing the company's long-awaited (and promised) AI upgrade. As teased during CES 2025, Gemini with Google TV lets users speak "naturally" to the AI for season recaps, entertainment recommendations, and more. Users can even get personal, telling the AI to try and find content that bridges the gap between two wildly different content preferences.</p><p>Gemini's addition brings something for kids, enabling them to learn about the world's captivating occurrences, like volcanic eruptions. The company said it would begin bringing this upgrade to TCL QM9K series devices first, before looking at its own Google TV Streamer, Walmart onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and more "later this year."</p><p>There <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/android-tv/google-tv-could-soon-let-you-create-ai-videos-right-from-your-couch">were some rumors</a> that Google might have even more in store with its AI, but a feature that could let users get a little creative with its generative capabilities.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The platform states that these new posts are launching today (Oct 27), giving users the ability to designate a post as a "ghost post." If selected, whatever you post will vanish within 24 hours. Meta states this is something users can use as a way to be "unfiltered" and post "fresh takes/thoughts" without "the pressure of permanence or polish."</p><p>When making a new post, users should soon notice a smiley face toggle with a disappearing thought bubble. If toggled, you will turn your static, "always there" post into a ghost. These posts have a dashed outline, so everyone knows what it is, as well as a timer that says how much time remains.</p><p>All replies to your ghost post are sent right to your DMs. You will see a snippet of the ghost post, just so you're aware of what someone is replying to. Moreover, only the creator can see who "liked" the post, too.</p><p>While Meta says this feature is launching today, we haven't yet noticed it appear in the Threads app. However, it should begin appearing for users as the week progresses.</p><h2 id="the-new-meta-on-threads-2">The new meta on Threads</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:862px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.61%;"><img id="tgCGNC6Y6zHGUug2YVBX9F" name="meta-threads-ghost-posts-example" alt="Threads adds "ghost posts," a feature that users can toggle to create a post that vanishes in 24 hours, and all replies are sent to your DMs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tgCGNC6Y6zHGUug2YVBX9F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="862" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ghost posts are just another way users can interact with others on Threads, and keep the experience feeling fresh. Meta highlights an update from September, which brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2025/09/attach-text-threads-posts-share-longer-perspectives/">text attachments</a>." The main highlight in that update was the increased 10,000 text character limit for longer posts. Not only did this let users write even more, expanding on their ideas and thoughts, but Meta says it gives others a chance to post article excerpts to kickstart discussions.</p><p>Earlier this month, Threads rolled out yet another update that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/threads-is-rolling-out-group-chats-and-expands-messaging-to-the-eu">brought group chat support</a> to the app. Users can now fully engage in group chats with up to 50 people. Expanding on this, Threads provides the option to customize your chat name while it prepares invite links for more people. Messaging others on Threads now also supports photos, videos, GIFs, and stickers, as well as "smart" privacy options.</p><p>Threads started rolling out its entire messaging experience, equipped with group chats, to users in the EU, too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Right now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank"><strong>Best Buy will give you up to $140 off the already affordable Samsung Galaxy A36 5G when you have them connect it to your carrier for you</strong></a>, or $40 off if you prefer to do it yourself. This brings the price point down to just $260 with activation, marking a solid deal for anyone who prefers to buy their phone outright instead of utilizing a payment plan.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-confirms-the-existence-of-the-unreleased-galaxy-a56-a36-and-a26">Galaxy A36 was launched</a> alongside the A26 and A56 earlier this year, with all three offering an economy price point for a few subtle downgrades. The A36 sports a decent-looking, 6.7-inch AMOLED display, and either 128GB or 256GB of storage—though this deal is for the base-level option.</p><p>The phone is available in colors dubbed Awesome Lime, Awesome Black, and Awesome Lavender, and they're all eligible for the discount at the time of writing. While you certainly shouldn't expect a premium phone out of the A36, it's still a good option for the price point, and definitely worth consideration at this sale price.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5" name="samsung galaxy a36 square render" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DB9b8Qd9NnHbgaVhT7ZvT5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A36 5G (128GB):</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-a36-5g-128gb-unlocked-awesome-lime/JJGRF3CK9C" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$259.99 with activation at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Samsung's affordable Galaxy A36 just got hit with up to $140 off for Best Buy's spooky season sale, so long as you let them connect the device to a carrier for you.

It offers a budget-friendly alternative to some of the maker's mid-range and premium-level phones, without compromising too much in the way of hardware or performance.</p><p>For starters, it's backed by 6GB of RAM and a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 Octa-Core processor, and this particular deal is for the 128GB storage option, though Samsung also offers a 256GB version. It also has a 5,000mAh battery, fast charging speeds of up to 45W, and a 6.7-inch AMOLED display that gets the job done. As for cameras, it includes a 12MP selfie cam, a 50MP regular rear-facing lens as well as an 8MP ultrawide.</p><p>All in all, it seems like a pretty decent pick for the price point, especially if you let Best Buy handle activation for you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It sounds like a lot of people consider the Google Tensor a mid-range processor that underperforms where it counts. It's time for me to buy a new phone, so I was wondering what you thought.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Is the Tensor just a mid-range Samsung copy, or is it a good processor?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p><p>Oh boy, talk about opening a can of worms!</p><p>I know what you mean and have seen the arguments for and against the Pixel line of phones, including those centered around a recent article saying it's the consumer's fault for not understanding why Google uses the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-tensor">Tensor SoC</a>.</p><p>What do I think? Well, I think the whole thing is the result of a valid question that has turned into two-sided <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1nzuje4/pixel_fans_are_done_forgiving_tensors/?rdt=52491">fighting on the internet for fighting's sake</a>. People love to attack what they don't have and defend what they do, and that's never helpful.

The company also isn't trying to win any social media arguments about chip wars. It wants to further its business model — that's eyeballs on the internet — and is using its own line of products to help make it happen.</p><p>Of course, it would love to have a profitable phone division and make money there, too. That means getting more out of a product than was spent to build it, ship it, and market it. While people arguing at Reddit may draw some attention, it's not ever going to dictate Google policy.</p><p>A few short years ago, Google needed the Tensor if it wanted to start this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-ai-phones">phone AI trend</a>. Google needed an engine that could power what nobody was trying to do, and the Tensor was the answer.</p><p>Raw performance (outside AI processing) or graphics benchmarks were never major factors, so Google went cheap. It worked, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-devices-represented-3-of-phones-shipped-in-north-america-last-quarter">sales of Pixel devices</a>, as well as user response, have been on a nice upward trend.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g" name="google-pixel-10-pro-jade-pixel-10-pro-xl-porcelain-backs" alt="The backs of the porcelain Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the jade Google Pixel 10 Pro standing next to each other on a bench" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U8SkPHytXzMKEFf7gU534g.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That was then, this is now. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mediatek-calls-out-qualcomm-new-dimensity-9000-flagship-chipset">MediaTek</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Qualcomm</a> both sell smartphone chips that do everything Google needs today, and Apple's chip can handle more than the iPhone ever could.

And Android Fitbit Premium users are getting first access to it.</p><p>Rolling out in Public Preview tomorrow, the Fitbit Personal Health Coach will show the same health and fitness data as before — like Cardio Load, Steps, Daily Readiness, Sleep Score, and more — but in easily digestible widget form, emphasizing weekly or monthly trends.</p><p>Most notably, the Public Preview starts with a 5–10 minute conversation where you help the built-in AI coach "understand your motivations and goals." It can then build a personalized, week-to-week plan that goes well beyond the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-fitbit-ai-daily-run-recommendations-helped-me-run-better">daily AI running recommendations</a>; it can prioritize a wide range of sports and build workouts from "over 1,000" possible exercises.</p><h2 id="how-the-fitbit-personal-health-coach-plans-work-2">How the Fitbit Personal Health Coach plans work</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AZyByJLKEZu7xNrQEkXVGD" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-workout-plans" alt="Fitbit Personal Health Coach screenshots showing two potential workout plans, one to "Improve stride length, balanced with light strength," and the other replacing a tempo run with a stretch workout because the user is flying to Greece the next day." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZyByJLKEZu7xNrQEkXVGD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fitbit's goal was to build an "agentic health coach" that can create a multi-week workout plan for any fitness goal, but then allow users to adjust their plan in response to unexpected injuries, travel, busy days at work, or any other context. It's "built on Gemini," but uses "different models" depending on the context, not just one version like 2.5 Pro or Flash.</p><p>The Fitbit Coach can build a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/choosing-the-best-marathon-training-smartwatch-for-my-upcoming-garmin-marathon">marathon training plan</a> targeting a specific date — like other fitness apps — with up to six weeks of workouts at a time, including cross-training workouts across a wide range of sports. Fitbit says it's "working on" adding a "further outlook" to support longer-term plans.</p><p>What's more interesting is that your Fitbit plan doesn't need to be so targeted or specific. It can be to "get ready for ski season" or "become a better trail runner." The AI will use this information to build workouts that target relevant muscle groups.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="G3aqxiLYwqjEWPd8CoJ6HD" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-today-tab-ask-coach-and-join-public-preview" alt="Three Fitbit app screenshots of the new Personal Health Coach: (left) the new Today tab with widgets for Cardio percentage, steps, Readiness score, Sleep duration, with a more in-depth Sleep widget below; (center) the Ask Coach tab where the user can ask for advice; (right) the Public Preview Program page where Fitbit users can sign up for the program." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G3aqxiLYwqjEWPd8CoJ6HD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A Fitbit rep showed us his personal Gemini-built plan, with a recommended "Skip Prep Power Circuit" for that day. It included specific exercises like Leg Blasters and Jump Squats, and the user can change the number of reps, ask the AI to choose new exercises that target the same muscle groups, or see videos with the proper form. You log each exercise as complete in the app once you're done.</p><p>During the onboarding session, Fitbit will ask what exercise equipment you have access to, such as a Peloton or dumbbells. It'll use that context when assigning you specific exercises. But if you're traveling, you can "Adjust workout" and tell the AI Coach to "Create a 30-minute upper body workout I can do in my hotel room" and have a new activity in moments.</p><p>The same would apply if you were sick, had an injury, or couldn't make it to the gym that day. Fitbit's flexibility means you can't simply decide you don't have time or the capacity for your planned workout; it can always find something new that's still relevant to your goals.</p><h2 id="everything-else-fitbit-personal-health-coach-can-or-can-t-do-2">Everything else Fitbit Personal Health Coach can or can't do</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1436px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XqWDqyuYSjbYubqX3TSTAD" name="Fitbit-personal-health-coach-hero-image" alt="A screenshot showing "Hello: I'm your personal health coach" on a dark background with text bubbles surrounding the text with sample questions for the Fitbit AI coach." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XqWDqyuYSjbYubqX3TSTAD.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1436" height="808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can open your Gemini app right now, ask "Why am I so tired?" and get a general answer with several possibilities. But ask that question in the new Fitbit app, and it'll deliver a targeted answer, citing your circadian rhythm, consistency, time in specific stages, and how others in your demographic group typically feel.</p><p>That's what makes the new Fitbit Personal Health Coach more useful than other LLMs: The relevance to your personal circumstances. You can ask it to summarize what it knows about you and get a <em>massive</em> text dump of information, or ask about your trends for a specific data point like HRV.</p><p>Even if you don't know what to ask, the Fitbit app will have customized "insight" widgets that show useful information related to your health, sleep, and fitness trends, shown in the examples below. We'll have to see how well it works in practice, but in theory, Fitbit will ensure you understand <em>why</em> your health stats are improving or worsening.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WC5GdyhRieNEXdoorJqFzC" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-sleep-insights" alt="A Fitbit Personal Health Coach screenshot showing a Sleep widget, describing why consistent bedtimes matter, with graphs for "Duration vs. need" and "Sleep score" over the past seven days." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WC5GdyhRieNEXdoorJqFzC.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JaDJ7bVuydfKV2ipyDUY3D" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-health-insights" alt="A Fitbit Personal Health Coach screenshot showing "Improved heart metrics" insights on your HRV improvements." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JaDJ7bVuydfKV2ipyDUY3D.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8vWvAEpJoKWs3EpfkvCo6D" name="fitbit-personal-health-coach-fitness-insights" alt="A Fitbit Personal Health Coach screenshot showing fitness insights in widget form, including exercise days, Weekly Cardio, and Steps" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8vWvAEpJoKWs3EpfkvCo6D.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>One area the new Fitbit app <em>doesn't</em> improve upon is nutrition.

The company launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-vs-phone-2a">Nothing Phone 3a</a> and Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-series-launch">Phone 3a Pro</a> earlier this year, and now the London-based brand appears set for the final phone in the lineup — the Nothing Phone 3a Lite.</p><p>Nothing has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://nothing.community/d/45651-phone-3a-lite-light-up-the-everyday">revealed</a> that it will officially take the wraps off the device on 29 October 2025 at 13:00 GMT (9:00 AM ET), which is just a couple of days away now. While the company hasn't shared much about the phone, the teaser posted on X suggests the Phone 3a Lite might skip the extensive array of lights usually seen on Nothing smartphones for a single LED.</p><h2 id="nothing-confirms-phone-3a-lite-is-launching-october-29-2">Nothing confirms Phone (3a) Lite is launching October 29</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone (3a) Lite. 29.10. 13.00 GMT.Light up the everyday. pic.twitter.com/VVNclQ6mEl<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1982718918536954334">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Another notable takeaway from the teaser is that the Phone 3a Lite will continue using the company's transparent design language. Nothing has previously unveiled <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget smartphones</a>, but all under its CMF sub-brand, which doesn't use the same transparent design and instead opts for bright colors and an industrial finish.</p><p>The Phone 3a Lite will be the company's first smartphone to feature entry-level specs paired with the design we've seen on its mid-range and flagship models.</p><p>In terms of specs, a leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.xpertpick.com/mobile/nothing-phone-3a-lite/">Xpertpick</a> claims the smartphone will come in a single 8GB+128GB configuration and two colors: Black and White. It will reportedly be priced at €249.99 in France (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/nothing-phone-3a-lite-un-modele-plus-abordable-attendu-pour-novembre-2025-60679">Delabs</a>) and available for purchase starting November 4, 2025.</p><p>Unlike other Nothing smartphones, the company hasn't shared much about the Phone 3a Lite ahead of its release, which is quite unusual. That said, we don't have to wait long, as the phone is set to go official in just a couple of days.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It marked the arrival of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> a few months earlier than I originally expected, but OnePlus is forging ahead with a classy new flagship phone design and a bunch of new camera tricks up its sleeve.</p><p>This is the first flagship OnePlus phone in years to drop the Hasselblad branding in favor of the company's new in-house <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-shift-from-hasselblad-official-debuts-detailmax-engine">DetailMax Engine</a>. If I've had any one complaint about the OnePlus 13's camera <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-camera-review">since I reviewed it earlier this year</a>, it's that the Hasselblad processing can sometimes be too aggressive with its contrast and often tones down vibrant colors too much for my liking.</p><p>So far, the new DetailMax Engine looks to fix both of these issues, giving me a more realistic picture that looked like what my eyes saw, not what the camera software thought might look better. The weather has been fairly abysmal in my part of the world this weekend, but I was able to head up to the mountains at the end of last week while it was a clear, calm morning and capture Fall in a way that felt authentic.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0

especially important if you're looking to see what the phone is truly capable of.</p><p>OnePlus's CEO, Pete Lau, previously said the new DetailMax Engine can "capture and interpret vastly more data, delivering images with unmatched depth and realism, " ensuring that photos never receive "over-beautification or distortion." Again, based on my time with the phone so far, this seems to absolutely nail my experience.</p><p>At this time, I'm only able to share a few photos of my adventures with the phone but plan to showcase a full review of its camera capabilities in the coming weeks. OnePlus is rumored to debut the phone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-price-leak">at a lower price</a> and earlier than expected. Rumors note a global launch may happen as early as Novemer 13, two full months ahead of the anniversary of the OnePlus 13's global launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company made Meta Ray-Ban Display only available for purchase after completing an in-store demo. The reasoning behind the decision was so that customers could interact with the device and get a proper sizing for the sEMG wristband before buying it.</p><p>Naturally, that made getting a Meta Ray-Ban Display a bit trickier at launch. There were some initial scheduling hiccups, as recounted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RaybanMeta/comments/1nvlxl5/update_on_meta_rayban_displays_the_info_they/" target="_blank">Reddit users</a>, and limited demo availability. Demos and delivery dates quickly slipped into November and December. Initially, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-put-the-future-of-tech-on-your-face">Meta said the Ray-Ban Display demos</a> would be available at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/best-buy">Best Buy</a>, LensCrafters, Ray-Ban Stores, and Verizon stores.</p><p>Verizon is only now starting to carry Meta Ray-Ban Display and accept demo bookings for the smart glasses. The first day of availability is Nov. 5, and you can schedule a demo slot now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/demo/scheduler/" target="_blank">Meta's website</a>. If you're lucky enough to live near a Verizon store offering Meta Ray-Ban Display demos, you might not have to wait long — there are still plenty of opening-week demos at Verizon stores at the time of publishing.</p><p>After completing the demo, you can buy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses">Meta Ray-Ban Display</a> straight from Verizon. It doesn't look like you need to be a Verizon customer to buy a pair, and they're available for the same $799 retail price at the wireless carrier. However, only the Black colorway is sold at Verizon, so you're out of luck if you're on the hunt for Sand.</p><h2 id="which-verizon-stores-will-offer-meta-ray-ban-display-demos-2">Which Verizon stores will offer Meta Ray-Ban Display demos?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm" name="Meta-Ray-Ban-Display-glasses-close-up-front" alt="A close-up photo of the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses held facing the camera to show the design, camera cutouts, and lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dKQz3aLAYpWp5qsFRU2ebm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, demo availability of Meta Ray-Ban Display is quite limited at Verizon stores.

The streaming service debuted in 2015 along YouTube Premium, and a decade later, it has over 125 million paid subscribers as of March 2025. The large subscriber count and user base allows <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music</a> to inject more cash into the music industry, and it hit a big milestone in 2025.</p><p>YouTube paid out more than $8 billion to the music industry in the year between July 2024 and June 2025, it said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/8-billion-youtubes-twin-engine-continues-to-fuel-the-future-of-music/" target="_blank">blog post</a>. The brand says this major payout reaffirms its "commitment to the music industry." It's the most YouTube Music has ever paid out to artists and the music industry at large in a 12-month period, and shows that payouts are rising with subscriber counts.</p><p>"Today's $8 billion payout is a testament to the fact that the twin engine of ads and subscriptions is firing on all cylinders," said Lyor Cohen, who is YouTube's global head of music, in the blog post. "This number is not an endpoint; it represents meaningful, sustained progress in our journey to build a long-term home for every artist, songwriter, and publisher on the global stage."</p><p>The company attributes the larger payouts to what it calls a "twin-engine revenue model."

As reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/10/26/chrome-141-android-m3-expressive-redesign/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, the rollout has been completed for most users, marking the end of the gradual deployment that began in late August.</p><p>Now, tapping the three-dot menu brings forward key actions (forward, bookmark, download, site info, refresh) inside circular icons.</p><p>In the Tab Grid view, the “+” for opening a new tab now lives inside a rounded square, and tabs, Incognito, and Groups all have clearer containers. Dynamic Color theming is applied (so it adapts to your wallpaper or chosen palette).</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:421px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:206.65%;"><img id="3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3TKQAwquFSsBicgaKpKwNj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="421" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:207.14%;"><img id="j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj" name="Chrome-for-Android-Material-3-Expressive-update" alt="Material 3 Expressive on Chrome for Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/j4bNLtSPUkq8UmZu2dCGFj.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="420" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="no-functional-shake-up-2">No functional shake-up</h2><p>Despite the splashier look, Chrome didn’t adjust button sizes or radically alter list-views or settings pages. It’s more a cosmetic refresh than a full redesign. The browser’s interface remains familiar enough that you won’t feel lost.</p><p>That means if you’re used to how Chrome worked before, you’ll still feel right at home. The update is more about aligning with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Google’s broader design language</a> across apps than reinventing everything.</p><p>There are smaller details, too. Watch as a page loads, and you'll notice a segmented progress indicator with rounded corners. Similarly, when you visit a website you've already bookmarked, the star icon in the menu will now have a rounded square background.</p><p>If you haven’t seen the new look yet, there’s a reason: the rollout is server-side. That means even if your Chrome version says 141 or higher, you may still be waiting for the visual switch to hit your device. Quick tip: force-stop the app (via Android Settings → Apps → Chrome → Force Stop) and then reopen it. That sometimes triggers the update faster.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After leading the foldable market with the Galaxy Z Fold and Z Flip, the company plans to reveal its first tri-fold smartphone later this week. But according to a recent rumor, the launch will be limited, and the U.S. probably won't get it right away.</p><p>The Korean tech giant is set to pull the wraps off the Galaxy Z TriFold at the APEC CEO Summit in South Korea, happening October 28–31. This launch marks the company’s jump into a completely new device category, featuring a dual-hinge setup that lets the phone fold twice.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-z-trifold-just-showed-off-its-unfolding-trick-in-a-leaked-animation">feature a dual-hinge in-folding design</a>, meaning both sides fold inward toward the main display. When closed, the phone looks like a typical smartphone with a 6.5-inch cover display, but once unfolded in stages, it can expand to 8 inches and, fully opened, stretch to a massive 10-inch screen.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:763px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:76.67%;"><img id="R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Trifold-unfolding" alt="unfolding and folding mechanism of the Galaxy Z Trifold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/R26KV66tJrgcF2TQna9q9Y.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="763" height="585" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @TechHighest / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Early reports suggest Samsung has been refining the hinge durability and optimizing the display software to ensure seamless transitions between folded modes. Under the hood, the TriFold is rumored to run on last year’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset rather than Qualcomm’s latest processor.</p><p>The price will put this phone firmly in the ultra-premium range, with estimates around 4 million won, or about $2,780. To reduce risk, Samsung is reportedly limiting the first batch to about 50,000 units, which makes sense since this is still an experimental product.</p><h2 id="western-markets-might-be-skipped-2">Western markets might be skipped</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unfortunately for foldable enthusiasts -- and despite recent rumors to the contrary -- I think it's very unlikely that Samsung will release its first trifold beyond Korea, the greater Chinese market (including Singapore & Taiwan), & possibly the UAE.

As the company moves into this new area, people will be watching to see how the TriFold performs in real life, including its hinge strength, battery life, and how well Android works with the changing screen sizes.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold could set the tone for the next generation of portable devices that blur the lines between phones, tablets, and even small laptops.</p> ]]></dc:content>
