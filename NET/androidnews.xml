They also boast powerful and customizable multi-band EQ, adaptive active noise cancellation, and a long enough battery life to get several uses out of them with each charge.

Their high-level audio is backed by two powerful 40mm titanium drivers with neodymium magnets that were custom-made for this series, improving the precision of audio quality and of lower frequencies.

For better or worse, it's not trying to build thick and battery-focused smartwatches like OnePlus or Garmin. It's also not trying to go for minimalism like Google and Fitbit. Instead, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 brings a differentiated yet practical design with a thin-and-light build and excellent software.</p><p>Switching from beefy smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin Enduro 3, having to charge the Galaxy Watch 8 multiple times per day was a tough adjustment. If you can get past that drawback, though, the Galaxy Watch 8 is a nearly-perfect Wear OS device. It's comfortable, provides useful and engaging health insights, and pairs nicely with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">best Samsung phones</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-pricing-and-availability"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Pricing and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FVnEVHxkpjEGo97NTf43JQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-18" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 on a railing." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FVnEVHxkpjEGo97NTf43JQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung first revealed the Galaxy Watch 8 at a Galaxy Unpacked event on July 9, 2025. The entire Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 lineup is generally available as of July 25.</p><p>The 40mm size of the Galaxy Watch 8 starts at $349.99 in the U.S., up by $50 compared to the Galaxy Watch 7. You can upgrade to the 44mm size for an extra $30, bringing the MSRP to $379.  Both models are available with an optional LTE upgrade costing $50 extra.</p><p>For perspective, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic starts at $499.99, and the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 retails for $649.99.</p><p>Various deals on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a> can make the wearables more affordable.

The company calls this a "cushion" design — it's like the circular screen is now resting on a squircle aluminum chassis, or a cushion.</p><p>The move serves two main purposes. The Galaxy Watch 8 now has a unique design language separate from the Apple Watch and competing Wear OS watches. More importantly, the larger footprint of the Galaxy Watch 8 on the wrist spreads out the internals better, allowing for a thinner form factor. Both size options measure 8.6mm thick, down from 9.7mm on the Watch 7.</p><p>The 40mm variant weighs 30 grams, and the larger 44mm size is only four grams heavier. All told, this makes the Galaxy Watch 8 one of the thinnest and lightest Wear OS smartwatches on the market. This is crucial, because it makes the Galaxy Watch 8 more comfortable to wear while working out and sleeping. To get proper health data, you'll need consistent sleep and activity tracking, and that's why the Galaxy Watch 8's slimmer design really matters.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VsAJXLs6BB5Y3aj3ieKGNQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 on the workout screen by the water." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VsAJXLs6BB5Y3aj3ieKGNQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, the daily Energy Score is the central metric of the Samsung Health suite. It grades your energy level for each day out of 100, using data points like sleep tracking, activity tracking, and more. You need to wear the Galaxy Watch 8 to bed to get an Energy Score, but that wasn't a problem due to how comfortable the new design felt.</p><p>Compared to similar features, like Garmin's Body Battery metric, I found that Samsung overestimated my energy level yet conservatively recommended activity plans. For example, I'd get an Energy Score of 87 for the day alongside a message that I should prioritize rest.</p><p>To me, those are a bit contradictory, but I'd always rather a fitness watch push extra rest instead of the alternative, which is to encourage overreaching.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vw2crvr9aJg8wa68c99GvN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 next to the Samsung Wearable companion app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vw2crvr9aJg8wa68c99GvN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fitness and health data was solid overall, with the Galaxy Watch 8 offering dual-band GPS and the Samsung BioActive sensor suite.

Even as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> was supposed to improve efficiency, I haven't been impressed with longevity on the Galaxy Watch 8. In order to have enough charge for sleep tracking and all-day wear, I need to make time for two 30-minute charge sessions daily — one right before bed and another in the morning.</p><p>Officially, the Galaxy Watch 8 should get 30 hours on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. As always, that figure depends heavily on how much you use it and how long GPS and fitness tracking are active. I got far fewer hours of use on days when I eclipsed 150 minutes of recorded activities. It makes sense, but it's something to consider if you live a very active lifestyle.</p><p>The smartwatch does charge fairly quickly, needing about 80 minutes to get from 0% to 100%. This makes my routine of two 30-minute charges per day possible. With that being said, I find that the more you need to charge a smartwatch, the more likely you'll forget to put it back on before going on with your day. That's why I'd recommend considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> if you need multi-day battery life or plan to track a lot of daily activities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t27YgQMa7WcgmrjambdvXN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-7" alt="The Google Messages app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t27YgQMa7WcgmrjambdvXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There were also times when I found the One UI 8 Watch operating system to be less than intuitive. Occasionally, you'll run into situations where Wear OS 6 and One UI 8 Watch clash — there will be two ways to do the same thing. For example, you can use Google's Wear OS dictation feature <em>or</em> the one built into Samsung Keyboard. I also found myself wishing there was a dedicated app for workouts separate from Samsung Health on my watch.</p><p>Navigation on the Galaxy Watch 8 could certainly be improved overall. The digital bezel system feels as gimmicky as ever, and the two side buttons feel underutilized. If you prefer tactile buttons, I'd strongly recommend taking a look at the Classic or Ultra models. Simply having a third Quick Button to customize on the Galaxy Watch 8 would've solved many of my navigation gripes. Unfortunately, the base model is the only one not to include it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-competition"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-8" alt="The main app view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's biggest competitor is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, soon to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>. Some might prefer the more dainty and minimalist style of the Pixel Watch compared to the very techy look of the Galaxy Watch 8. It'll also pair better with a Google Pixel phone, and could be a better pick for Android users that don't have a Google or Samsung device.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that the Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to measure around 14mm thick — practically in another category compared to the 8.6mm Galaxy Watch 8. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> gives you the best battery life in a Wear OS watch, but like the Pixel Watch 3, it's a chonker. The large size and bulky, rugged look might not be for everyone.</p><p>Outside of the Wear OS space, it's worth reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> if you want long battery life above all else.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TW5bZhKwEGUKn2No2Rgyif" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-10" alt="The a running workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TW5bZhKwEGUKn2No2Rgyif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have a Samsung Galaxy phone and want a first-party companion</li><li>You need a thin and light watch that will fit comfortably during workouts and sleep</li><li>You like the mix of Gemini and Samsung Health software features available on this watch</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-day battery life is a main priority for you, or if you track a lot of activity</li><li>You need great hardware controls, like customizable buttons or a rotating bezel</li><li>You don't like the hardware design or the One UI 8 Watch interface</li></ul><p>With generally the same sensor suite, display offerings, and processor, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8's hardware hasn't been completely overhauled. For some reason, it feels that way regardless. The switch to the squircle design isn't something you need to settle for — it's actually good. Go with a silver case color to contrast with the black display bezel, and you've got a seriously eye-catching Wear OS smartwatch.</p><p>Whether you feel compelled to upgrade to Galaxy Watch 8 will depend on your priorities. I traded in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> because I found it to be too bulky for daily use and running, and the Galaxy Watch 8's thin and light form factor is a breath of fresh air by comparison. On the other hand, those looking for longer battery life and faster charging will be disappointed.</p><p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 might be the best base-model Wear OS smartwatch to date.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2412d494-403e-4c24-8854-f59afc81e306">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3osjQ7T4Eof4nqKPSLadWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A sleek Wear OS watch</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is a thin and light wearable packed full of Wear OS features, on-wrist AI, and fitness and health tools.

Customers start by purchasing one of the carrier's four plan options in 3, 6, or 12-month increments of time. There are no hidden fees or confusing contracts to worry about, and you can easily upgrade or downgrade your plan at will once the time allotment has run out. There's even a seven-day money-back guarantee that lets you try out the service with zero stress if you're having trouble committing.</p><p>Starting at $15 per month for three months of the introductory 5GB plan, all of Mint's plan options give you talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's vast 5G network, plus you get free calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. There are also a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> that could get you a great Android phone for dirt cheap if you play your cards right. </p><p>If your network gets congested, you may notice slower speeds after 35GB on the Unlimited plan, but that's pretty common for prepaid carriers. Indeed, MVNOs aren't perfect, but these carriers remain nice options for students because they're simple, affordable, and allow for lots of flexibility. If that's what you're looking for in a phone plan, then Mint Mobile is an amazing choice. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wV4LAyfoohDQzZwodU5Sf6" name="tello-phone-hand-169.jpg" alt="Tello homepage on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wV4LAyfoohDQzZwodU5Sf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-tello-5gb-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tello-mobile-review">3.

If you're really looking to cut costs, Tello's 5GB plan is a great choice, starting at just $10 per month and giving you access to T-Mobile's comprehensive 5G / 4G LTE network. </p><p>Tello Mobile also lets you completely customize your plan every month with no penalty. Only want to pay for 500 minutes of calling this month? You can do that. Need Unlimited data for a month to catch up on your favorite TV show? You can do that too. All of Tello's plans also come with a 5GB mobile hotspot, plus Wi-Fi calling support and free calls to over 60 countries worldwide. </p><p>Looking at the negatives, Tello's data speeds do tend to fluctuate during busy periods, and taxes aren't applied to your monthly rate until you get to the checkout page. All things said and done, however, these are small issues when you consider the low cost and flexibility offered by Tello's data plans. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-features"><span>Best features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2730px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="WaZcCWyYBGc78hufQ2AYf4" name="Verizon-outside-169-2.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in city park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaZcCWyYBGc78hufQ2AYf4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2730" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-verizon-welcome-unlimited-2"><span class="title__text">4.

Verizon switched to a mix-and-math perk system a few years ago and hasn't looked back, offering customers a wide range of excellent features, from Cloud Storage to streaming services and everything in between.</p><p>The Verizon Welcome Unlimited plan starts at $65 per month for a single line with AutoPay, although the price can drop considerably if you add multiple lines. The base plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data on the company's iconic 5G network, plus you get a three-year price lock guarantee. After you sign up for the base plan, you get to mix and match perks for $10 per month apiece. </p><p>These perks include things like Netflix subscriptions, Apple Music, Unlimited Cloud Storage, and more. The best part is that Verizon allows you to update your perks every month, which means you can adjust your plan features as needed every 30 days with zero hassle. </p><p>The problem is that Verizon's plan can get pretty expensive if you're not taking advantage of the multi-line discounts, and the base tier doesn't include much on its own. Still, it's a great option if you like consolidating your entertainment apps and don't mind bringing the family along. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP" name="t-mobile-retail-storefront-169.jpg" alt="T-Mobile retail storefront" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">5.

The Experience Beyond plan is easily one of the Big Three carrier's best offerings if you can afford it, presenting customers with unlimited talk, text, and premium data every month alongside a true bounty of perks. </p><p>The plan starts at a steep $105 per month with AutoPay, but you get unlimited coverage with free subscriptions to Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and Hulu (with ads). The Experience Beyond plan also gives you an unlimited mobile hotspot and coverage (capped at 15GB of high-speed data) in over 200 countries worldwide. Those perks feel fairly standard for premium phone plans nowadays, but T-Mobile also throws in a few perks that you may not expect, such as free in-flight texting and Wi-Fi on select flights and a five-year price guarantee. </p><p>Sure, it's obviously too expensive for many students, but if you can make it work for you, T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan is the gold standard of what a premium phone plan can look like in 2025. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-international"><span>Best international</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2033px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xQ5Etz5K46TeAtHmnRaYqY" name="Ultra-mobile-tourist-sim-card.jpg" alt="Ultra Mobile SIM card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xQ5Etz5K46TeAtHmnRaYqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2033" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-ultra-mobile-12gb-2"><span class="title__text">6.

If you need to go beyond the international coverage included in your plan, Ultra also sells international call credits and a one-time roaming credit for five bucks apiece. Like most of the plans on this list, the 12GB tier also comes with a free mobile hotspot and Wi-Fi calling support. </p><p>Similar to Mint Mobile's buy-in-bulk system, members can pay $29 for a single month of the 12GB plan, or you can drop the price to as low as $20 monthly if you pay for a full year in advance. If you don't need 12GB of data every month, Ultra also offers preconfigured plans that starting at 4GB monthly. </p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RvPmL3L4VMEj2z7g2cnEaT" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-12.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL with a game running on the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvPmL3L4VMEj2z7g2cnEaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're shopping for yourself or a tech-savvy high schooler, choosing the right student phone plan doesn't have a one-size-fits-all solution — it depends on the user. Does the student in question have a regular Wi-Fi connection? Do they need lots of data? Are they shopping on a budget? All of these questions should be addressed before you decide on one final wireless plan. </p><p><strong>Going with an MVNO carrier</strong> is convenient for students because you aren't typically locked into a long contract, which means you can adjust your plan from month to month to fit your needs. If you or your student has been a phone user in the past, check old usage statements to see how much time and data gets spent on devices each month. If you regularly use less than 10GB of data, for instance, then an unlimited plan really isn't necessary.</p><p>It can also be helpful to <strong>look at the entertainment perks</strong> included in the data plans. If you're already using Disney Plus, Netflix, Hulu, et al., you may be surprised at the number of wireless carriers that include free subscriptions with their phone plans. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="diVoXVMFuP9o9mogC7TRpM" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diVoXVMFuP9o9mogC7TRpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, <strong>consider if you need a new device</strong> with your data plan. If you don't care about buying phones unlocked, you can find some seriously good deals by purchasing a device through your wireless carrier. Companies like Verizon and Mint Mobile will hook you up with a cheap (or even free) Android phone for simply adding an eligible line to your account, and the savings get even better if you're able to process a trade-in.</p><p>All things said and done, there's no shortage of great phone plans for students, you just need to find the one that's right for you. Visible is my top pick because it balances the price of an MVNO with the perks of a Big Three carrier, but it's far from the only option. Simply ask yourself the questions laid out above and you'll be well on your way to a perfect wireless experience this school year. </p><ul><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

I thought the eSIM was supposed to be better technology than the old physical SIM card.</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I really appreciate any answer</strong></em></p><p>Hi L, I saw exactly the same thing as you did; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Pixel 10</a> <em>may</em> be an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-rumor-ditching-physical-sim-for-esim-consumers-beyond-worried" target="_blank">eSIM-only device</a> in the United States, and people lost their ever-loving minds over the news. Everyone hates eSIM.</p><p>Except they really don't.</p><p>The easy answer is that you're seeing a biased response from a small group of people. I'll imagine you're a bit of a tech-lover. That means you see articles and social media posts from other tech-lovers, or websites (like Android Central) dedicated to tech-lovers.</p><p>Many tech lovers hate the eSIM, and we'll get to why in a minute. But first, realize that most people have no idea what an eSIM is. They probably don't really care, either. Some of the people who do understand happen to like the eSIM. But the people who don't like it are using their voice and letting the world know about it. That's what you're seeing, not messages from people saying they have no idea what an eSIM is. It seems like there is no love.</p><p>Now, for why many people who understand it all hate the eSIM: Apple. Yeah. It's easy to blame Apple, and this time, it's even easier.</p><p>Apple launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-14-problems">iPhone 14</a> in the U.S. as an eSIM-only device. It was not the first eSIM device, or even the first iPhone that could use one. It was the first iPhone that required you to use it, though.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">carriers started having issues</a> assigning numbers to the chip, or started making up new rules about hoops you needed to jump through to transfer your number to a new iPhone, it was pretty messy. Not for everyone, but for enough people.</p><p>If your first exposure to the eSIM was trying to convince Verizon to activate your new iPhone 14 without you walking into a corporate store with a receipt and your old phone in working order, there's no wonder you hate it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Fo3EnQV3sgf9WMp6nFd56Q" name="iphone-14-face-down.jpg" alt="iPhone 14 face down on chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fo3EnQV3sgf9WMp6nFd56Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Stephen Warwick / iMore)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For some contrast, my first exposure to eSIM tech was checking a box in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi</a> app and having my new phone start working without pushing a paperclip into the tiny hole that releases the SIM card tray. It took about three minutes and worked fine.</p><p>Needless to say, I don't have the same hate for the eSIM that many do because my experience with them has been good. I haven't used a physical SIM card since the Pixel 3.</p><p>That doesn't mean I like everything about the eSIM or that they are perfect. I don't, and they're not. The eSIM gives too much control over a thing you paid for to someone else.</p><p>As long as you weren't using a phone that was marked stolen or blacklisted due to non-payment, you could always pop a SIM card in the tray and make it work. You might need to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-apn-and-how-do-i-change-it">look up some numbers and find the settings</a>, but it was up to you.</p><p>An eSIM doesn't work that way. It's a tiny chip that can be flashed with your account data, but you're not the one doing the flashing. The phone maker and even worse, your carrier, are the only means to activate an eSIM. You might <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/knowroamings-new-esim-service-gets-you-connected-us-or-europe-just-10">pay for one online</a> and get what you need to know in an email, but in the end, you're connecting to another entity that can decide if it wants to set things up. You have no control over the situation.</p><p>That doesn't mean an eSIM is bad. It also doesn't mean it's good, either. It is cheaper, more environmentally friendly, and is going to eventually become the norm. If you have problems setting up or using an eSIM, I'd suggest you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/poll-responses-too-soon-for-esim-only-phones">look at a different carrier</a> instead of a different phone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You get magnetic bases on both, they both latch onto your car's windshield or dashboard via a sticky 3M adhesive, and both mounts have malleable arms. Each mount comes with a sticky magnetic ring to go on the backside of your phone. Heck, even the price is the same — $30 for each one.</p><p>So what's the difference between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Magnetic-Bendable-Titanium-Dashboard/dp/B0F7XCBP2S/">PrimeTrip C03</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Adjustable-Reversible-Flexiable-Compatible/dp/B0F7XFJS5T/">PrimeTrip C03s</a>? For one, the C03 has a flat, fettuccine-like arm and a rotating base. This means you can bend and contort the arm as much as you like, and also choose to rotate it to whatever degree you prefer. The rotating base can be tightened to secure it in place.</p><p>On top of that, the square magnetic "head" tilts, so you can further adjust the angle at which your phone tilts toward you. This makes it incredibly easy to find the perfect viewing angle while seated in the driver's seat.</p><h2 id="a-two-pronged-approach-2">A two-pronged approach</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="skhNEEePKvoHqV2fSEitWG" name="Baseus-Prime-Trip-C03-and-C03s-Magnetic-Car-Mount-lifestyle-6" alt="Baseus PrimeTrip C03 and C03s Magnetic Car Mounts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/skhNEEePKvoHqV2fSEitWG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KojjcDdy5ot9CpPK8mBMgG" name="Baseus-Prime-Trip-C03-and-C03s-Magnetic-Car-Mount-lifestyle-3" alt="Baseus PrimeTrip C03 and C03s Magnetic Car Mounts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KojjcDdy5ot9CpPK8mBMgG.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Meanwhile, the PrimeTrip C03s Magnetic Car Mount has two spaghetti-like flexible arms that can bend into whatever shape you like. Each base has 3M adhesive, allowing you to stick it onto the dash or the windshield.</p><p>Since there are two arms on the C03s, it lacks a rotating base. This model also lacks the swiveling head, although it is magnetic in nature. However, the thinner arms make this mount a lot more flexible than the C03, so you can easily twist it into a tilted angle that matches your line of sight when sitting behind the wheel.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3879px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pDoY5Q5a7NTtmKsPuEuoWG" name="Baseus-Prime-Trip-C03-and-C03s-Magnetic-Car-Mount-lifestyle-7" alt="Baseus PrimeTrip C03 and C03s Magnetic Car Mounts" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pDoY5Q5a7NTtmKsPuEuoWG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3879" height="2182" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Traditional car mounts with adjustable clamps are plain awful. I never fail to struggle inserting my phone into those types of car mounts, which is why magnetic ones are a dream to use. There's no fussing about with clamp arms or feet; you simply plop your phone on and carry on with your business. There's a highly satisfying snap to it.</p><p>There's no denying the practical advantage of a magnetic car mount over a traditional one with clamps. I wish the Baseus PrimeTrip mounts didn't use 3M adhesive, but had suction cups instead. While 3M is a lot sturdier, it can't be removed once glued in place.</p><p>Both the Baseus PrimeTrip C03 and C03s Magnetic Car Mounts have their uses. If I had to choose between the C03 and C03s, I'd go for the PrimeTrip C03 for the rotating base and tilting head.</p><p>And while both the magnetic car mounts are reasonably priced, I'd personally wait for the next Prime Day event or Black Friday to buy them for $25 or under. After all, you can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/esr-qi2-car-charger">ESR Qi2 15W wireless car charger</a> for about $32, and that works as a magnetic car mount but has the additional wireless charging feature to increase the value prospect.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6768c14d-e5d4-4bef-897a-e6f601452c66">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2Xj8gY7646DiVjBYRsKcJ.jpg' alt="Baseus PrimeTrip C03 Magnetic Car Mount"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Baseus PrimeTrip C03 Magnetic Car Mount</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>It twists and turns</strong></em></p><p>The Baseus PrimeTrip C03 Magnetic Car Mount has a rotating base, a magnetic head that tilts, and a sturdy flat arm that can be bent to suit your liking.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="b02b25d4-8986-440b-b9fc-ef57d61c8f2b">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eXSNPtQddxkGSefnzaiUaL.jpg' alt="Baseus PrimeTrip C03s Magnetic Car Mount"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Baseus PrimeTrip C03s Magnetic Car Mount</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Dual-armed mount</strong></em></p><p>Need more stability and flexibility?

Chances are, you'll eventually need additional accessories or replacement parts for your Android audio gear sooner or later. The good news is that if you have access to a 3D printer, you can make everything you need at home.</p><p>Originally, I didn't think to use my 3D printer for my headphones and earbuds. I printed a few wall mounts for storage, and that was about it. Then, the headband on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/i-pitted-the-airpods-max-against-my-usd3000-audio-setup">AirPods Max</a> wore out, and it'd be around $300 to get it fixed from Apple. I obviously didn't do that, and instead found a cheap fix using my Bambu Lab A1 printer that cost merely 22 grams of filament.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qZ6WkKieU7HYZNwxc7Cc6a" name="3D-Printer-Audio-Accessories-4" alt="A headband insert for the AirPods Max made using a Bambu Lab A1 Mini printer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qZ6WkKieU7HYZNwxc7Cc6a.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That sent me down a rabbit hole — what other things could I print for my massive collection of wireless headphones and earbuds?

Not everyone uses cases on their earbuds’ included charging case, but it can help add extra protection against drops and scuffs. You’d be surprised how much an earbud case can get roughed up sharing a pocket or bag with your keys. So, this 3D printed protective case had my attention.</p><p>What’s more is that this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-review">Pixel Buds Pro 2</a> case is designed to resemble the Android Bot mascot. It has the eyes, the famous Bot head, and the arms. Honestly, this custom case is a must-have accessory for Android fans. It adds a bit of protection and a unique look that you won’t find on many other Pixel Buds Pro 2 cases out there.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zuM6wia6X6DWqDSD2QVqDG" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-Case-2" alt="The Android Bot 3D-printed case on a pair of Google Pixel Buds Pro 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zuM6wia6X6DWqDSD2QVqDG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It looks simply awesome, with the "mouth" opening up to reveal the earbuds when the case is open. There are cutouts for the status light, USB-C port, and speaker. I printed this in green translucent PETG filament, but flexible TPU would work better for this kind of thing. I just couldn't resist making a green Android Bot to match the Mint colorway of my Pixel Buds Pro 2.</p><p><strong>H/T</strong> - <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://makerworld.com/en/@spasbilyarski" target="_blank">@spasbilyarski on MakerWorld</a></p><h2 id="carabiner-loop-case-for-oneplus-buds-pro-3-2">Carabiner loop case for OnePlus Buds Pro 3</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8TUSuBVpyWbGLDcHFJo2Jb" name="3D-Printer-Audio-Accessories-9" alt="A loop case for the OnePlus Buds Pro 3 made using a Bambu Lab A1 Mini printer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8TUSuBVpyWbGLDcHFJo2Jb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Next up, my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/oneplus-buds-pro-3-review">OnePlus Buds Pro 3</a> needed a makeover.

In my testing, the TPU materials grips the charging case well.</p><p><strong>H/T - </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://makerworld.com/en/@im.jackharvest" target="_blank">@im.jackharvest on MakerWorld</a></p><h2 id="replacement-ear-tips-for-beats-solo-buds-2">Replacement ear tips for Beats Solo Buds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="s952KCdDuaxck485SDsXUZ" name="3D-Printer-Audio-Accessories-2" alt="Replacement ear tips made using a Bambu Lab A1 Mini printer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/s952KCdDuaxck485SDsXUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm sure we've all lost an ear tip at one point or another — I know I have.

ChatGPT has more weekly users than Meta or Google has on a <em>monthly</em> basis. Being first comes with benefits, which OpenAI is certainly reaping.</p><p>In the time since, though, the competition caught up — at least on a functional level. AI models from Google, DeepSeek, Claude, and xAI have all held top-five spots on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard" target="_blank">LMArena's leaderboard</a>, signaling that the race from basic large language models (LLMs) to artificial general intelligence (AGI) is far from decided. For months, I've been certain that Gemini 2.5 Pro is a better and more versatile thinking model than anything coming out of OpenAI.</p><p>Well, OpenAI is hoping to change that narrative with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/">the release of GPT-5</a>, which launched for everyone last week (Aug. 7). It's actually a collection of models that can intelligently pick which one is best for a given prompt on the fly. And at least for now, it's at the top of both the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards — two crucial LLM benchmarks.</p><p>GPT-5 doesn't solve all of ChatGPT's hallucination problems, and it's definitely not AGI. There are some areas where Google models still outperform comparable ones from OpenAI. Regardless, GPT-5 looks impressive and free, and that might be all OpenAI needs to maintain its hefty lead over the competition.</p><h2 id="where-openai-s-gpt-5-beats-google-s-gemini-2-5-pro-2">Where OpenAI's GPT-5 beats Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2896px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.87%;"><img id="KJKNtUC3iPcem7jE9ahkg9" name="GPT-5-Thinking-Prompt" alt="The ChatGPT interface thinking with GPT-5." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KJKNtUC3iPcem7jE9ahkg9.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2896" height="1618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>GPT-5’s smartest feature has nothing to do with compute or its knowledge base. It’s called real-time routing, and it helps pick the right model for your task without any additional user input. Currently, AI chatbots like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and Gemini are littered with a variety of new, old, and experimental models best suited for a specific prompt. That’s great, but the onus was on the user to decide which one is best. With names like GPT-o3 and GPT-4o, or Gemini Flash Thinking Experimental, making that decision wasn’t always easy.</p><p>Instead, GPT-5 is a simple name for a collection of OpenAI models. It includes a lightweight model for quick, easy prompts and a more thoughtful model called GPT-5 Thinking for complex queries. OpenAI’s real-time router means that all of these models function as one, at least to the user. After inputting a prompt to ChatGPT, the GPT-5 router will decide which one to use, streamlining the UX.</p><p>There are still ways to manually control which GPT-5 model responds to your prompt. You can use phrases like “think really hard about this” in your prompt to trigger GPT-5 Thinking. If ChatGPT mistakenly opts for the thinking model, users can tap <strong>Get a quick answer</strong> to pivot to the lightweight model instead. Both models appear to be very reliable in early testing, clearly citing sources to avoid hallucinations.</p><p>These online sources, which include sites like Android Central, are a key reason why hallucinations are down with GPT-5. OpenAI says that with web search enabled on GPT-5 prompts, the model is about 45% less likely to contain a factual error than GPT-4o. Hallucinations are by no means extinct, but they are less prevalent when using GPT-5 in ChatGPT.</p><p>Independent tests and benchmarks seem to align with OpenAI’s claims that GPT-5 is better at writing, coding, and health-based tasks. It finally usurps Gemini 2.5 Pro on both the LMArena and WebDev Arena leaderboards, claiming the top spot overall. Specifically, GPT-5 seems to have the edge in text-based and coding prompts. I used a sample prompt from OpenAI to test GPT-5’s coding capabilities in ChatGPT, and came away seriously impressed.</p><h2 id="where-gemini-still-beats-chatgpt-2">Where Gemini still beats ChatGPT</h2><p>GPT-5 isn’t better than <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini 2.5 Pro</a> in every area, and OpenAI still doesn’t seem to be able to match Google’s image and video generation. That’s reflected in LMArena’s text-to-image, text-to-video, and image-to-video benchmarks — Google’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-introduces-new-ai-tools-to-help-creatives-direct-like-a-pro">Imagen 4 and Veo 3</a> tools sweep the graphical suite of generative AI tests.</p><p>I wanted to test that outcome in the real world, so I fed ChatGPT and Gemini the same prompt: "Generate an image of Johnny Thunderbird holding up a Big East Tournament trophy at Madison Square Garden." Here’s how the images turned out:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="FgrE7BAhpLtYuErFFdjDbM" name="GenAI-Images-Google-OpenAI" alt="ChatGPT and Gemini respond to the prompt: "generate an image of Johnny Thunderbird holding up a Big East Tournament trophy at Madison Square Garden."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FgrE7BAhpLtYuErFFdjDbM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Anecdotally, the generated images align with the benchmark results — Google’s video- and image-generation chops are much stronger than OpenAI’s. For starters, Google gave me a generated image in about 10 seconds, and I had to wait nearly two minutes for an image to come back from ChatGPT.</p><p>From an accuracy standpoint, Gemini won handedly. It knew I was talking about my alma mater’s basketball program from the mascot reference, and correctly recreated Madison Square Garden with a ton of detail and flair. Meanwhile, ChatGPT produced an image with the wrong team and I’m not convinced the generic background is really MSG; it looks like it could be any basketball court.</p><p>So, if you’re the kind of person who likes to switch between LLMs based on your task, perhaps choose GPT-5 for writing or coding and Gemini for image or video generation.</p><h2 id="gpt-5-is-great-but-gpt-4o-just-won-t-go-away-2">GPT-5 is great, but GPT-4o just won't go away</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P" name="chatgpt-kotor-ii-galaxy-z-fold-6" alt="ChatGPT Live Conversation transcript about KOTOR II on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W2CK2WE8g9kEHTCzyBUj3P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A wrinkle in OpenAI’s GPT-5 rollout is user attachment to older models. GPT-5 was more than two years in the making, as OpenAI reportedly struggled to make an AI model worthy of the title. As it turns out, users didn’t want one. OpenAI is bringing back GPT-4o — a model that was supposed to be sunset in favor of GPT-5 — because of user backlash (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/ai/chatgpt-4o-is-coming-back-after-massive-gpt-5-backlash-heres-what-happened" target="_blank">Tom’s Guide</a>).</p><p>It might seem silly for those of us who touch grass, but ChatGPT users have seemingly created parasocial relationships with OpenAI models. They’d rather use the AI model they “know” over GPT-5, even if the newer one is better in every way.</p><p>I think you can extrapolate this premise to the broader AI race. In some ways, it really doesn’t matter whether Google, OpenAI, Claude, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-you-need-to-know-about-deepseek">DeepSeek</a> has the best-performing model. People are going to stick to the models they like and are familiar with, and if that’s the case, OpenAI’s lead in this space may be insurmountable for the competition.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Students 18 years old or older can sign up for Google's AI Pro plan for free in the previously mentioned countries. Not only will students be gifted 2TB of Cloud storage with this plan, but they'll also receive access to Gemini's 2.5 Pro model.</p><p>The 2.5 Pro model features multi-step reasoning, while also utilizing "certain techniques" to reach a reasonable conclusion to queries. Google teases that students will also find Deep Research with 2.5 Pro, meaning Gemini will go deeper in its search and understanding for more complex topics.</p><p>NotebookLM enters to help condense those lengthy notes and study guides into more digestible packages. Additionally, Veo 3, Google's latest video generation model, gives students signing up the ability to create eight-second clips (sound included).

this entirely.</p><p>In terms of features, the Pixel Buds 2a will reportedly not support Silent Seal 2.0, but there will be some level of improved Active Noise Cancelation (ANC). The earbuds will also skip features such as conversation detection and wireless charging. Battery life is reportedly up to 7 hours for the earbuds and up to 20 hours with the charging case.</p><p>Not all is bad news, though, as Google is said to be bringing Spatial Audio along with head tracking support to these affordable earbuds — something missing from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-buds-series-review">first-generation Pixel Buds A</a>.</p><p>In terms of cost, however, there may be a downside. The Pixel Buds 2a will reportedly start at €149 (~$174) in Europe, which is a €50 increase over the previous generation in the region. There's no information yet on whether this price increase will apply in the U.S., but thankfully, we don't have to wait long to find out, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect">Made by Google event</a> now just over a week away.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming accessories, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a></p> ]]></dc:content>

Each model shines in various colorways, which could be the colors consumers can expect when launch rolls around in a week. For the base Pixel 10, what's been the highlight in recent rumors is its third camera, which rumors say is a telephoto lens.</p><p>This may bring the device closer to the rest of the series in terms of offered cameras. The strength will be subjected to tests once it arrives, no doubt. The renders Blass shared on X show off the phone in four colors (as rumored previously): Obsidian, Indigo, Frost, and Lemongrass.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro took its time down the alleged catwalk, showing itself off in three options: Obsidian, Porcelain, and Moonstone. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/new-pixel-10-colors-have-been-leaked-bringing-some-unexpected-storage-treats">Previous rumors claim</a> this model should see a Jade option, too, but the leak today didn't offer a look at that variation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:443px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:122.35%;"><img id="vPkd8tatJfRRYPAxT9GtWM" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-jade-leaked-render" alt="A leaked rendering of the Jade color option for the Pixel 10 Pro XL with brass-like sides and camera bar." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vPkd8tatJfRRYPAxT9GtWM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="443" height="542" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When we get down to the larger Pixel 10 Pro XL, that model features all four previously rumored colors: Obsidian, Porcelain, Jade, and Moonstone. For the Jade option, the 10 Pro XL's sides and even its large camera bar assume an almost brass-like hue. The other models feature sides and camera bars with colors close to the device's body, such as a more silver approach for the Moonstone variation.</p><p>There are loads of renderings that Blass has shared via a lengthy X thread.

The highest-tier slab phone for the Pixel series is expected to retain a design similar to last year. This means consumers can likely expect rounded corners, a completely flat display, and three cameras on its back.</p><p>Speaking of those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/another-pixel-10-series-leak-info-on-specifications-buds-2a">more interesting specs</a>, another leak late last week suggests a 6.8-inch Super Actua display for the 10 Pro XL. Its camera capabilities were rumored to include 8K recording, a 50MP wide lens, a 48MP ultrawide lens, and a 48MP telephoto with 100x zoom. Rumors suggest 16GB of RAM will be its maximum, with a battery that should last ~24 hours or more, depending on use. The rest of the Pixel 10 series was also alleged in those rumors, as well, giving us a better idea of what launch could hold.</p><p>We're not far now, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Google's event</a> for the Pixel 10's launch will be hosted on August 20.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

The company went from relying on other OEMs to showcase the power of Android to buying up a couple of phone divisions and releasing its own take. And now, the best Pixel phones span multiple price points and even form factors.</p><p>Of the current available options, our favorite pick is actually a two-fer. It's either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> or the Pixel 9 Pro XL, as these phones share the same specs, with the exception of screen size and battery life. But the great thing about Google's current ensemble is that there's a Pixel phone for everyone, no matter what your budget and needs dictate.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-at-a-glance"><span>At a glance</span></h2>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_hero" data-id="13dc9f48-05f4-45ec-92cf-fda0758cb825">            <a href="#section-best-overall" data-model-name="Google Pixel 9 Pro" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RGLzkSSEaGTvsjXvJayfZN.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro official render - Hazel - Front/Back"><span class='featured__label hero__label'>Best overall</span></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">1.

All while housing a massive 8-inch inner display, complemented by a 6.3-inch cover screen, both with a 120Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Naturally, the Tensor G4 is at the helm, paired with 16GB of RAM, and just like the Pixel 9 Pro, it's a beast.

Instead of the camera bar on the back, the 9a's dual-camera system is simply embedded into the back, like the old days. This helps Google's budget phone stand out from the crowded budget scene in a completely different, but good, way.</p><p>Like the other devices in Google's 2024 lineup, the 9a comes equipped with the Tensor G4, but with "just" 8GB. As a result, performance drops a bit when compared to the Pixel 9, but not by very much. It's not until you get into the realm of Gemini features that you really notice the difference.</p><p>Part of that is due to the fact that while the Pixel 9a still includes Gemini Nano, it's a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9a-low-ram-smaller-gemini-nano-model-report">limited version</a>" called "Gemini Nano XXS." With this, Google removed some Gemini features with the 9a, such as the Pixel Screenshots app and Call Notes. That said, it still includes the more popular features like Gemini Live, Best Take, Magic Editor, and others.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-value"><span>Best value</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-google-pixel-8-pro-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">4.

For one, Google (and partnering retailers) are still offering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a>, usually at a rather steep discount.</p><p>On paper, the most noticeable difference between the 8 Pro and its successor is the chip, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3</a> provides the horsepower here. Besides that, we have a flagship camera system, headlined by the 50MP wide-angle lens, joined by a 48MP ultrawide, and a 48MP telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom.</p><p>You might also enjoy better battery life with the Pixel 8 Pro, at least compared to the standard 9 Pro. This is thanks to the 5,050mAh cell powering the operation, compared to the 4,700mAh battery in the 9 Pro. Beyond that, we don't see anything wrong with saving yourself a few hundred bucks and getting 90% of the same experience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-mid-range"><span>Best mid-range</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ" name="Google-Pixel-9-review-18.jpg" alt="The Pixel 9 on a plant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B92RTdf3ovHDMjCEdRgTUZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-google-pixel-9-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">5.

It's just not as easy of a phone to recommend when the Pixel 9a exists, and the Pixel 9 Pro is only $200 more. Nevertheless, if this is the phone for your budget, then you'll be more than happy.</p><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h2><h2 id="there-s-a-pixel-for-everyone-2">There's a Pixel for everyone</h2><p>It can seem a bit daunting when trying to decide which of these is the best Google Pixel phone for you.

Each of these have their pros and cons, so it will ultimately come down to what you value more.</p><p>If you're okay with missing out on a few AI features but want a larger battery, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/the-pixel-9a-makes-me-feel-weird-in-a-good-way">Pixel 9a</a> is probably for you.

Then, the Pixel 9 is there to fill the needs for anyone still looking for an option.</p><p>No matter what phone you decide on, just know that you're getting one of the best phones that money can buy. Google has come a long way in both the software and hardware in recent years, and it definitely shows.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One of the larger features rolling in is a more "simplified" takedown request procedure. The post states businesses will find the "Request" tab renamed to "Drafts" in this experience revamp. More than that, users will notice new "sub-tabs" for the different types of violations.</p><p>Meta states businesses will have clear distinctions between "Copyright, Counterfeit, Impersonation, and Trademark" violations.</p><p>Additionally, the search/filter options within the Reports tab can now encompass "email report IDs, keywords, trademark names, and report owner names." While the takedown request experience aims to become simpler, Meta states it's looking to upgrade its reporting environment to help businesses flag "suspected scam ads at scale."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1069px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.13%;"><img id="pwb7s472u7XWQwcVQpLEsP" name="meta-brand-rights-protection-tools-business-updates" alt="Meta is rolling out updates to its Brand Rights Protection tools to help businesses better protect their image from scams and false ads." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pwb7s472u7XWQwcVQpLEsP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1069" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As this arrives for businesses, Meta says users will see an "Other" violation type option. The company says users can utilize this option when discovering ads that don't "explicitly use their intellectual property." It should be useful for "suspected" scams and even "misleading ads" that may use a business' name without their explicit consent.</p><p>With the majority of today's update concerning the scam and violation side of the Brand Rights Protection suite, Meta is also improving the experience for MMA (Meta Managed Accounts). In an email to Android Central, Meta said businesses with MMAs can log into their Brand Rights Protection dashboard with SSO (single sign-on). Essentially, this removes the necessity for a personal Facebook account.</p><p>Businesses should notice these updates roll out for Brand Rights Protection as the week progresses.

As such, we expect that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> will continue to receive the same software update promise of previous Pixel generations, meaning it will get seven years of OS upgrades and seven years of software updates.</p><p>Google has made this a standard for Pixel phones starting with the Pixel 8 series. This is one of the best software update promises in the industry, with other companies like Samsung and Honor also promising seven years of updates. The difference with Pixels, however, is that they also come with frequent Pixel Drops, which bring a host of new features at least once a quarter alongside security patches. This means that users can expect new features throughout the year, not just when a major Android version drops.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="c5TD68Ha4WqiGB4vBKAG8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c5TD68Ha4WqiGB4vBKAG8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In addition to Pixel Drops and monthly security updates, users can also expect Android feature drops, which, like Pixel Drops, add new features for all Android users, Pixel or otherwise.

I'm predictably rusty and was never that good in my teens. But I've been pleasantly surprised by how useful my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-announced-with-premium-tools-apple-watch-ultra-like-display">Garmin Venu X1</a> has been as a (sort of) golfing beginner.</p><p>Growing up, I would get wowed by Tiger Woods chipping in at the 16th at Augusta, or Phil Mickelson doing some magical flop shot, and then drag my dad to the local 9-hole Par 3 course to practice. I fancied myself good at the short game, but never really mastered my swing.</p><p>I eventually graduated to playing (badly) on proper-sized courses with friends during high school. But after growing six inches, my youth-sized clubs held me back; then I went off to college and the working world, never finding the time or money for new clubs. Running was much easier on my time and budget.</p><p>Now, I'm finally falling back into golfing at my local course with used clubs. I'm still at the stage where I'm just happy if I don't top or shank a ball, but I'm getting better after hundreds of swings at the driving range. And when I'm playing a round, I find that glancing at my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> has been an excellent alternative to dedicated golf tech or apps.</p><h2 id="this-garmin-watch-is-a-straightforward-rangefinder-replacement-2">This Garmin watch is a straightforward rangefinder replacement</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="cMzcr5GYkBnFtBHaABEGRL" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-yardage" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole, a golf sign showing the actual yardage behind the Venu." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMzcr5GYkBnFtBHaABEGRL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The sign was about 10 yards further back of the tee box, but Garmin's numbers matched the official data. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As a near-sighted person who spends most of his day staring at monitors, I'm very bad at judging distances. Hitting at the range, I can tell if I've struck a ball well or how far it's slicing; once it goes past that 100-yard sign, though, it's hard for me to guess how much further my five iron is going than my nine iron.</p><p>My Garmin watch gives me that context on the course. When I start a Golf activity, it pulls from my GPS data and its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/golf-courses/">43,000 predownloaded courses</a> to show my location relative to my local course map. I can then see exactly how many yards I have left to go to the center of the green, whether I'm at the tee or on the fairway.</p><p>Knowing that I have 120 yards to go, picking a club based on that information, and then seeing immediate evidence if I chose correctly is vital for an amateur who lacks context or instinct for what club to use.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="sB5q7ejdiZjf5TP3YfjCKc" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-playslike-distance-view" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 showing a Golf activity with the Playslike distance visible, including elevation, wind, and humidity data.

If I'm laying up, I can check around where I'm aiming for the exact yardage to the next hazard.</p><p>Ever since I heard a golf shop worker and customer ranting about slow amateurs fiddling with rangefinders or golf GPS apps when they should be focusing on their swing, I've worried about testing the patience of whomever I'm paired with. A simple smartwatch golf app solves that problem.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nboTv9MMLf5V5LgU258o9d" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golf-round-summary" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 next to a Google Pixel 9a, both showing a golf activity.

After the round, I can check each hole for how far I drove the ball off the tee, my drive accuracy, greens in regulation, and other stats.</p><p>Generally speaking, I was impressed with how accurate Garmin's auto-tracked golf shots were. The only place the Venu X1 failed was in detecting my putts or certain chips. I assume subtle putt motions are hard for a watch gyroscope to measure against normal arm motions.</p><p>But it's easy to log my score at the end of each hole — saving me from having to pocket a physical scorecard — and then have the watch auto-update to the next hole's yardage and conditions, so I can start mentally planning my next shot while walking to the next hole or waiting for other players to finish.</p><h2 id="why-i-prefer-my-garmin-venu-x1-to-other-golf-watch-options-2">Why I prefer my Garmin Venu X1 to other golf watch options</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="edscwPtdezEwaj4WQmunKL" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-golfing-3" alt="The Garmin Venu X1 on a wrist next to a golf glove, showing the yardage for the hole, with a golf cart path and tree visible behind the Venu X1." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/edscwPtdezEwaj4WQmunKL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I last golfed before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness watches</a> were a "thing," so I've yet to test how other brands handle golfing. But since Garmin beats most other brands for GPS accuracy and battery life, it was a natural fit to try first.</p><p>Only a few premium Garmin watches, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-review">Fenix 8</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a>, and Venu X1, have pre-downloaded courses. The Approach series is more affordable and built for golfers, but its training tools are more limited for running, hiking, and other activities.</p><p>More importantly, I've become <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-x1-bizarre-premium-watch-stuck-between-two-worlds">spoiled by the Venu X1's massive, 2,000-nit display and lightweight design</a>.</p><p>On a normal fitness watch, the circular display cuts off visual space, so you have to zoom out more to see all the details or scroll through the hole if you prefer an enhanced view. With the Venu X1, I just naturally see the whole hole, with enough space for buttons in the corners and yardage that doesn't block vital visual data.</p><p>It's easier to tap specific points to check the hazards or contours, but you rarely need to because the default view shows so much.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB" name="Garmin-Venu-X1-vs-Apple-Watch-Ultra-2-thickness-3" alt="The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (left) and Garmin Venu X1 (right), both worn on one wrist, showing the two watches' comparative thickness." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vAn9Xi8kwy4ThNj6eCdCqB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>More importantly, I barely notice the Venu X1's 40g weight on my wrist, and it's so skinny (with no crown) that there's no chance it bumps into my wrist when it bends mid-swing.</p><p>Any normal smartwatch weighs about 1.5–2X that; when I try making a swinging motion with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>, I immediately notice the watch bouncing away from and against my wrist from the momentum, unless I wear it so tightly that it's uncomfortable.</p><p>It's hard to recommend the Venu X1 without some reservations: it's expensive, even for a Garmin watch, and a rangefinder would be cheaper. Plus, you may not like the squircle look, and while its battery is more dependable than an Apple or Wear OS watch, a full 18-hole course of GPS tracking will burn a decent chunk of its battery life.</p><p>But since I already have a Venu X1, I can't see myself willingly wearing any other watch to the course. It helps a beginner like me make snap-judgment decisions on which club to use, without being uncomfortable or a distraction.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="78ad4d40-9173-4cf1-908e-e8238012e6d2">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YPdCZ7m4g99urshSyncAJ3.jpg' alt="Render of the Black Garmin Venu X1 smartwatch"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                    <span class='featured__label horizontal__label'>Premium putting companion</span>                                                            <div class="featured__title">Garmin Venu X1</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>The Garmin Venu X1 has a 2-inch AMOLED display but only weighs 40g with its nylon strap, half as light as many premium smartwatches.

I understand it's coming and there's nothing we can do about it. It's just entirely profit-driven, and there's nothing we can do about that, either. Simply put, companies like Google will churn out AI-powered nonsense nonstop as long as it makes them money. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/ai-overviews-update-may-2024/">They can apologize for it later</a>.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>I could go on and on about how you're being fooled with buzzwords like "learning" and "intelligence" while it's really just programming, but I'm tired of writing it, and people are tired of reading it. You are either on the AI train or not.</p><p>Instead, I found something from Google Gemini that blew my socks off.</p><p>I'm talking about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-ai-storybook-new-level-of-imagination-bedtime-update">the latest Gemini Gem, the Storybook</a>. It's a prebuilt routine that will let you tell it what to write about and how to illustrate it, then put out a 10-page children's book. Nothing more, nothing less.</p><h2 id="why-do-i-care-and-why-should-you-2">Why do I care (and why should you)?</h2><p>It's something AI like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> could already do, but packaging it up nicely into its own user-space makes it one of the best things Google has done in a long time.</p><p>You might wonder why a middle-aged, grumpy man cares about a way to make children's storybooks. Besides having grandkids (who <em><strong>love</strong></em> this), I really don't. It's not the product itself as much as the presentation and the benefit it brings to kids. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/storybooks/" target="_blank">Try it yourself </a>if you haven't, and I think you'll get it.</p><a href="https://gemini.google.com/share/3727e49b234d" target="_blank"><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1782px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="8hKnftaf2q4mLTBPbQBabS" name="Gemini-Storybook-Gem" alt="A Children's Storybook made with Google Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hKnftaf2q4mLTBPbQBabS.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1782" height="1002" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">You can read about Samuel the snake and his friend Sophia right here.

I'm thinking about a young parent (or grandparent) sitting with a child and using the tool to make a delightful story that kids will not only love, but want to share with their friends.</p><p>AI isn't designed for kids; in fact, a lot of it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai-probably-wont-drive-mankind-to-extinction-but-it-can-be-harmful">can be very harmful</a>, and a look at the latest tech news can tell you more than you wanted to know about people using AI to exploit others, including kids. It sucks, but it's human nature to use any new technology to make other people's lives miserable. When the apes eventually replace us, I hope they can do better.</p><p>But I digress. Mostly, this reminds me of something the "old" Google would do. Google, which wanted to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/health/ruth-porat-remarks-asco/">help cure cancer</a>, or use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-parent-alphabet-pulls-plug-its-ambitious-loon-internet-balloon-project">balloons to get free internet for people</a> in places like Africa.

There is no display, so you won't be scrolling through Instagram in the bathroom or anything like that. It's a very basic wearable computer that can collect data and send it to an app on your phone, and not much more.</p><p>Having said that, smart rings can be very accurate. More accurate than a smartwatch and way better at things like counting steps than your phone could ever be. They're great devices for tracking your health and fitness, but not so much when it comes to anything else.</p><p>And you know what? It's fine if you just aren't into the smart ring craze. I'm not; they don't offer anything I really need that my smartwatch doesn't give me. Plus, my watch has a screen so I can use it to see things like an incoming text.

Sometimes a device doesn't need to do a little bit of everything to be useful.</p><p>As mentioned, <strong>smart rings can be very accurate</strong> when it comes to measuring things like heart rate or body temperature. They're not as accurate as a certified medical device (and they aren't advertised to be), but because they tend to fit "better" than a smartwatch, they get better readings.</p><p><strong>Smart rings are small and light</strong>. That can be important when you're doing some exercises. As you can imagine, it's easier to lift weights or run five miles wearing a ring than it is while wearing a heavy watch or carrying your phone.</p><p><strong>Smart rings don't look "weird"</strong>. A lot of people care about the accessories they wear and are turned off by the look of a big, clunky watch. Smart rings are minimalistic and sleek. Except for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/casios-odd-watch-shaped-smart-ring-is-actually-coming-to-the-us">that wild Casio one</a>.</p><p><strong>Smart rings send everything to an app on your phone</strong>. The apps are pretty good, too! That puts your health and fitness data right where you want it, and you won't have to try and swipe, twist, or tap on a small watch screen to do anything.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eY7tQYJAdgCwkgLtNyy2mJ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Ring-gold-01.jpg" alt="The Galaxy Ring on a book with a flowery design" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eY7tQYJAdgCwkgLtNyy2mJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nothing is ever perfect, and you need to weigh the good against the bad before you pull out your wallet. Smart rings are no exception.</p><p><strong>They are expensive</strong>. I'll start here because almost everyone thinks they cost a lot. You'll spend about the same amount of money on a smart ring as you would on another wearable, but it seems like you should be paying less because they're so small.</p><p><strong>They often come with a subscription</strong>. You pay for the smart ring, then you sometimes pay to get the most use out of it. Only you can decide if the monthly fees are worth it.</p><p><strong>You can't adjust the fit</strong>. They're a ring and you need to carefully buy the right size. If you lose or gain a little weight, they aren't going to fit well. If you become pregnant, they aren't going to fit well. Your finger needs to stay the same size as it was when you measured for the right size.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/smart-rings-are-disposable-tech"><strong>They're disposable</strong></a>. You can not have a smart ring serviced or repaired. They're simple devices with a battery that should last 12-18 months before it even starts to degrade, but once they get "old," there's nothing you can do about it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can't call this one, but I can say what I decided and why. You need to figure out if you need (or just want) a high-tech ring to go along with the rest of your tech.</p><p>I don't use one. I decided I didn't need anything from the list of pros enough to justify the cost of yet another expensive device, and instead just wear my old, scratched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-review">Garmin watch</a>. It tells me what I need to know and most everything I want to know, too.</p><p>One final thought that <em>could</em> be helpful: they aren't any good at tracking your movement if you're in a wheelchair. Most wearables aren't, but companies are working on it. Of all the devices I've tested, I have to continue to recommend a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> if you want to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-venu-3-best-smartwatch-if-youre-wheelchair-bound">keep track of how many "pushes" you've done</a> throughout the day until Apple or Google get their software sorted out at the same level.</p><p>Take the time to see if you even need a smartwatch, and think about things like subscription fees before you decide.

How has Google's compact flagship held up over the past year, and is it still worth buying in 2025 with the Pixel 10 on the horizon?</p><p>In 2024, I would have easily recommended the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a> to anyone who asked, not because it was my favorite phone (disclaimer: I am generally not a huge Pixel fan), but because it's a generally good phone. It has cameras that most people would love, pretty decent battery life, tons of fun AI features to keep things exciting, and a software promise that would make most other flagship phones jealous.</p><p>So what's the problem? From the get-go, the Pixel 9 has had quite a bit going against it, from the $100 price increase to its "late" software and the lack of hardware you'd find on comparable phones. On its own, the Pixel 9 is a fine phone, but assuming the Pixel 10 will cost the same, it will have to do more than "fine" if it wants to justify the price.</p><h2 id="slow-software-start-but-google-made-up-for-it-2">Slow software start, but Google made up for it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="egH862ZZP9867kx9i6a3Gc" name="Android-16-Share-Audio-Pixel" alt="Audio Sharing on a Pixel 9 running Android 16 beta 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/egH862ZZP9867kx9i6a3Gc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When the Pixel 9 launched, Google surprisingly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-pixel-9-series-boasts-a-faster-chip-brighter-screens-and-new-ai-features">launched it with Android 14</a> instead of Android 15. Admittedly, the Pixel 9 series launched quite a bit early compared to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a>, so we can give Google some slack there, but it was still odd to get a new Pixel with old Android software out of the box.</p><p>Fortunately, it didn't take Google long to remedy this and then some. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-review">Android 15</a> rolled out in early September with new features like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">Private Space</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-to-enable-adaptive-vibration-on-a-pixel-phone">adaptive vibration</a>, changes to screen recording, improved multitasking on large screens, and more.

I can sort of understand where some of this would come from, given that better hardware like the more capable <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> and 12GB of RAM may warrant a price increase, but the Pixel 9 is hardly the spec powerhouse like some other similarly-priced Snapdragon-powered phones.</p><p>I will say that I haven't been disappointed with the Pixel 9's overall performance. After all, the Tensor G4 isn't meant to compete in terms of raw power, but in day-to-day use, it still performs fine with my daily needs: taking photos, playing some games, scrolling through Instagram, and perhaps the occasional AI-generated image or summary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2070px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="AKBQTHAzPxRupBQxVXaBic" name="google-pixel-9-camera-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Testing Google Pixel 9's camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AKBQTHAzPxRupBQxVXaBic.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2070" height="1164" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The most obvious omission is in the camera department, where the Pixel 9 still features just two sensors. Fortunately, Google is pretty good at AI upscaling, but zoom is limited to 8x because it's likely the sensor can't produce good results any further than that.</p><p>Meanwhile, the $800 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a> features three cameras with a 3x telephoto lens that can zoom up to 30x.

Pro Controls, 8K video recording, and high-res 50MP photos are just some of the features missing from the Pixel 9. Night Sight Video and Video Boost are also not present, despite the Pixel 9 seeming quite capable of performing these features.</p><p>After all, the Pixel 9 features the same Tensor G4 chip as its "Pro" siblings, even if RAM is limited to "just" 12GB. Even if they perform better on phones with more RAM, it seems odd that Google is skimping out on imaging features when Pixels are known for their camera capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GDPQjBRpXvvndJVVE2459P" name="pixel-9-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL next to one another" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GDPQjBRpXvvndJVVE2459P.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fortunately, Battery life has been a bright spot for me, and I never seem to have an issue with the Pixel 9 lasting through the day, which is more than I can say for many flagships.

And unless you have the right type of charger, you're probably better off buying a Google 45W charger if you don't wanna sit around waiting.</p><p>After all, what's the point of having a great all-day battery if I'm spending all day charging it?</p><h2 id="the-pixel-9a-problem-2">The Pixel 9a problem</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TetbMwB5dn8TSKX32EMFjP" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-9" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TetbMwB5dn8TSKX32EMFjP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>.

Google had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">make some design changes</a> to fit a larger battery, but it's still impressive.</p><p>When the Pixel 9a launched, Android Central editor-in-chief Shruti Shekar questioned why it exists, as it seemed to confuse the Pixel 9 lineup a bit. She suggested <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-shouldve-merged-the-pixel-9-and-9a">Google split the difference between the two phones</a> into one that costs somewhere in between, a sentiment I agree with.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-could-finally-be-worth-it-2">The Pixel 10 could finally be worth it</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj" name="Pixel-9-vs-9a-5" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris compared to the Pixel 9 in Peony." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H5QcxrTXFDs6ZWZZYYtkKj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 9 isn't a bad phone, and I think that most people should be happy with it. However, I think they'd also be happier spending $200 more for the Pixel 9 Pro or just waiting for the Pixel 10.</p><p>According to rumors, the Pixel 10 could bring many of the changes we've been hoping to see. Leaks have revealed a triple-camera setup that may finally bring a telephoto lens to Google's entry-level Pixel flagship. Meanwhile, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> chip is likely going to bring some nice performance improvements, and Qi2 magnetic charging may finally be on the table.</p><p>Assuming Google doesn't increase the price, you may want to wait for the Pixel 10 to launch.

Those colors are as follows: Iris (silver body), Lemongrass (brass body), Porcelain, and Obsidian (obsidian body). For its 45mm version, the tipster alleges a Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>Later, Evan Blass' X post also brought a full look at the Pixel Watch 4, a purported close-up of the smartwatch in all its glory. The Pixel Watch 4 could seem to retain the familiar circular, domed-glass design of its predecessors.</p><p>It also highlights the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">rumored side-mounted charging system</a>, which will feature an "indentation" with "two charging contacts" inside.

That day is finally here, and it's the representation of Meta doubling down on its vision that AI glasses are the future, and anyone without a pair is going to start feeling left out in life.</p><p>It's similar to the way people started talking about smartphones after the original iPhone was announced, and it feels like a paradigm shift in computing has already begun. Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses aren't a revolution over <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, but they do represent an important evolution over those specs.</p><p>In addition to the unique Oakley HSTN style, these frames offer the choice of Prizm polarized lenses, better video capture stabilization, longer battery life, and a case that'll keep your glasses charged longer than before. They're a solid improvement, albeit maybe a tad on the expensive side, especially for the limited edition pair.</p><p>I've been using Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses since July 16, 2025, for this review.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-price-and-availablility"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN: Price and availablility</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6" name="oakley-meta-hstn-with-box-02" alt="Warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses with its box and charging case on a white table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6VdvqXKrQJ3935cu9XNBX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Limited-edition Warm White Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses launched in late July 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/oakley-meta-hstn-glasses-limited-edition-prizm-24k-polarized-lenses-warm-grey/6636582.p?skuId=6636582">for $499</a>.

If you're using them as sunglasses, I say yes.</p><p>My Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses have transition lenses on them, a choice that'll be available on Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses soon. But while the transition lenses are convenient and allow me to wear the Ray-Bans indoors and out, the level of tinting even in bright sunlight leaves a lot to be desired.</p><p>To illustrate this, I set my camera to manual shutter speed and ISO so it wouldn't adjust the brightness level to compensate for dark conditions.

Since Oakley Meta HSTN lenses are "built for athletes" and anyone spending a lot of time outdoors, it seems like a smart idea that Meta only offered this choice initially.</p><p>But Prizm lenses don't just offer good tinting. They also "enhance vibrance and visual experience," according to Oakley. I've never used a pair of Prizm lenses before these glasses, and now I realize what I've been missing. Again, I took a camera to the lenses to showcase what you'll see with Prizm lenses, this time with normal brightness compensation enabled.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm" name="oakley-meta-hstn-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-prizm-lens-color-comparison" alt="Comparing Oakley Meta HSTN Prizm lenses with Ray-Ban Meta transition lenses to see the color difference" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmKeGuJSGAC3PuSEwE9Mpm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The first time I put the glasses on, I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

I preferred using these to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-camera-review">take pictures and video</a> over any of the glasses' other functions. Video capture, in particular, is such an excellent use of these since it provides a unique perspective that frees up both of your hands and your full body to do normal things without having to worry about holding (or dropping) a phone.</p><p>They're also faster than a phone to take a picture or record a video since they're ready to go at a moment's notice. Just press the button or ask Meta to start a video or snap a picture.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBL0acIBb2Y" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of this, the experience isn't functionally any different from Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. They act like a pair of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/best-open-ear-earbuds">open-ear headphones</a>, but the sound quality isn't noticeably improved over Ray-Ban Metas. Still, I loved using these as a way to talk on the phone hands-free while driving. They're even better than my Ray-Bans because of the tinting provided by the Oakley Prizm lenses.</p><p>Meta AI works exactly the same as it does on Ray-Ban Metas, including the choice of using the "Hey, Meta" keyword or just tapping the right temple touchpad to invoke the assistant. Because it can use the cameras and microphones from the glasses, Meta AI is an incredibly powerful tool that can be helpful in tons of situations.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3RrxZh8udLn7PJnqFG7uoN" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-on-head-01" alt="A woman wearing a pair of limited edition warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses on her head." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3RrxZh8udLn7PJnqFG7uoN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For example, I was walking around my backyard and noticed a newly planted rhododendron was looking pretty fried on one side. I asked Meta AI what could be happening, and it suggested that the plant might be getting too much sun.</p><p>Upon further inspection, I realized the fried side was facing the westward sun. Given that it's high summer at this point, that made a lot of sense, and I ended up relocating the plant to a shadier spot. Meta AI effectively saved my plant, and it's just one of the many reasons it's incredibly useful to have on a pair of glasses.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-what-needs-improvement"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN: What needs improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vp5zdMU7byqJPdNgxPXZtS" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-arms" alt="The straight sides of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vp5zdMU7byqJPdNgxPXZtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If there's anything these glasses need, it's some padding for the temple arms. The glasses are nice and tight on my head, and don't wobble at all for most tasks. In the video above, I took it out for several runs and went through several different types of exercises that all involved lots of body movement.</p><p>The only time they failed to stay on my head was when I was doing burpees, which involve dropping to the floor to essentially do a push-up, then standing up and jumping at the top. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses held on far better, and it's because the temple arms are curved at the end.</p><p>Because the Oakley temple arms come to a smaller, straight point, I found them to be less comfortable than the Ray-Ban design when wearing them for hours. Again, a set of rubber temple pads should help this a lot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5W57XSTscGKDzg6eVS2mBQ" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-02" alt="Holding a pair of limited edition warm white Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5W57XSTscGKDzg6eVS2mBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Beyond comfort, Oakley Meta HSTN battery life still leaves a bit to be desired. If you're using it for mixed purposes — that is, asking Meta AI a few questions, listening to some music, and taking a few photos or videos — these glasses still can't last a whole day on a single charge.</p><p>Now, that's not to say there isn't a notable improvement. As my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review">Oakley Meta HSTN battery review</a> showed, you'll get roughly 60% better battery life from these glasses. That's not double the battery life as Meta's estimates show, but it's an improvement that's far better than the annual upgrade most modern smart products offer.</p><p>I was also disappointed that the new 3K camera didn't improve image quality to any meaningful degree. You'll find fewer compression artifacts and some slightly crisper imagery when choosing 3K resolution in the Meta AI app's glasses settings, but it's not worth the tradeoff in battery life or image stabilization. Stick with 1080p, the default out-of-the-box setting.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oakley-meta-hstn-should-you-buy-them"><span>Oakley Meta HSTN: Should you buy them?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="RvzjXkDy5pScCVcFEbabWX" name="oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-wearing-02" alt="Wearing a pair of limited-edition warm white Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses with 24K Prizm lenses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvzjXkDy5pScCVcFEbabWX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy them if....</strong></p><ul><li>You want a hands-free way to take pictures or video, make phone calls, listen to music, or chat with Meta AI.</li><li>You love Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses but need longer battery life.</li><li>You want a pair of Oakley's with lots of extra functionality.</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy them if....</strong></p><ul><li>You are planning to record over an hour of video or listen to music for more than 3 hours per charge.</li><li>You want a pair of smart glasses with a display.</li><li>You don't want to give Meta any more of your data than it already has.</li></ul><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">best smart glasses</a> Meta has made to date, featuring better video capture, longer battery life, and incredible Oakley Prizm lenses. The battery upgrade alone is a reason to choose them over Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, so long as you have the budget for it.</p><p>And that's the biggest problem with Oakley Meta HSTN: the price. Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses retail for $299 and can sometimes be found on sale for $250 or less. Oakley Meta HSTN start at $399 and really only offer two main advantages: better image stabilization during video capture, and roughly 60% better battery life. There's no doubt both of these are great selling points, but it's hard to justify $100 extra for them.</p><p>But if you want the best of the best, these perfectly fit the bill. They're by far the best AI smart glasses on the market and they provide the best camera capture quality you'll find on any glasses to date. Regular updates for Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses tell us that these will see new features for years to come, and it helps make the $399+ price tag a little more palatable in the end. So long as you're OK with Meta gathering more of your data, of course.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="da93088f-a14f-456c-847d-18376c458ac8">            <a href="https://www.meta.com/ai-glasses/oakley-meta-hstn/" data-model-name="Oakley Meta HSTN" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRxAtAtsLkG2oTnhntPqgD.jpg' alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Oakley Meta HSTN</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are the next evolution in Meta's lineup of smart glasses, featuring plenty of frame styles and lens options, better battery life, better video stabilization, and authentic Oakley looks.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Well, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold made me realize that Google's taking the foldable form-factor seriously, even if it hasn't dipped its toes into the flip-style yet. So with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> around the corner, it's a good time to reflect before I need to decide whether to upgrade or not.</p><p>Since its release, I've basically been going back and forth between the Pixel 9 Pro Fold and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-one-year-later">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. On a few rare occasions, I just tossed a spare SIM into one of them, ditched my iPhone, and just carried two foldables for a couple of days. It's not something I really recommend, but as long as your pockets are big enough and you're wearing a belt, it's manageable.</p><h2 id="the-hardware-holds-up-2">The hardware holds up</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4959px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="kMgYVkQPKZtxmFGxc3wR8o" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-and-Samsung-Galaxy-Z-fold-7-1" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold next to the Galaxy Z Fold 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kMgYVkQPKZtxmFGxc3wR8o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4959" height="2789" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Until the original Pixel Fold was finally unveiled, I had been clamoring for Google to join the parade before it was too late. Then the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> landed, and while I was elated to see my wishes become reality, I came to the realization that Google might not be cut out for this kind of hardware.</p><p>Then came the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, and to this day, I'm still flabbergasted by the stark difference between the two phones. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on" target="_blank">initial impressions</a> piece, I said that Google "really went for the 'Pixel 5 to Pixel 6' upgrade path, and if it weren't for the 'G' on the back, I'd go so far as to say these were made by completely different companies." That sentiment still rings true today.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT" name="home-control-screen-saver-pixel-9-pro-fold-google-pixel-tablet.jpg.jpg" alt="Home Control screen saver on Pixel 9 Pro Fold and widgets on Pixel Tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dCvKo4Vcg9qQXVET9tzGQT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Sure, the phone is still slippier than I would like, but that's been remedied with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-cases">Thinborne MagSafe case</a>. It adds hardly any extra thickness to the phone, but gives me MagSafe support, something that I'm hoping will actually end up in the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Besides that, I really haven't had much to complain about with the design. The cover screen is the same size as the Pixel 9 Pro, giving me a slab phone for one-handed use, but with the obvious benefit of unfolding into a Pixel Tablet Mini.</p><h2 id="where-the-software-falls-short-2">Where the software falls short</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pro-Fold-Main-Screen" alt="The Pixel 9 Pro Fold's main screen open in hand." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kCFoS9NbMAUwvfELWfypJ9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As for the software, I would be lying if I weren't a bit worried about how Google planned to combat the ongoing headaches when using apps on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Samsung manages to clear some of the hurdles by including the "Multi-window" option to "force" apps into working via the Labs Settings.</p><p>Instead, Google took a different approach, which also played a major role in the overall design. When using two apps in split-screen portrait mode, the aspect ratio is practically identical to that of a traditional smartphone, meaning that it's basically like having an app open on two phones and holding them side-by-side. It's an ingenious solution to a seemingly unsolvable problem, given the sheer number of Android apps out there.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn" name="Two-Apps-Pixel-Fold" alt="Multitasking on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/F4nXdS8W3Q2CdCuPuq8dLn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, that solution immediately falls apart as soon as you want to add a third app into the mix. With the Galaxy Z Fold, you can have three apps in split-screen, along with a few more in Pop-up View. OnePlus and Oppo have the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-oneplus-open-as-good-as-i-remember">Open Canvas</a>, allowing you to have apps open, move them off-screen a bit, and then tap the edge of the app to bring it into focus.</p><p>With the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, once you pick the two apps you want to use, that's all you've got. A common example for me was having two apps open and then needing to grab something from my password manager. Instead of being able to just have the app open in a floating window so I can grab what I need without leaving the app pair, the third app just takes over as the primary.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4994px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="npJSk2dZRu3iffxzowVyhT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-16" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/npJSk2dZRu3iffxzowVyhT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4994" height="2809" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's more of an annoyance than anything else, but I can't help but wonder why Google hasn't added some type of implementation.

In addition to what I've already covered, I want to experiment with Google's new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-android-canary-release-channel-devs-rigorous-testing-pixels">Canary Release Channel</a> and see how far I can go in creating a Linux desktop environment on the phone.</p><p>If the Pixel 10 event wasn't right around the corner, I'd probably be <em>very</em> tempted to try and get another Pixel 9 Pro Fold, if not just for the Made You Look feature. But before we know it, Google will have unveiled the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, and I don't want to waste an upgrade on my account beforehand.</p><p>That said, even if it weren't for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/another-pixel-10-series-leak-info-on-specifications-buds-2a">tsunami of leaks in recent days</a>, leaving little to the imagination with Google's next foldable, I might have considered using the upgrade anyway.</p><p>I've already written about whether you should wait for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/should-you-wait-for-the-google-pixel-10-pro-fold" target="_blank">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, and even with the leaks, my feelings remain the same.

Even we here at Android Central aren't too keen on eSIM as a "forced" requirement; however, leaving it optional might be the better choice.

However, the differences will reportedly lie in its RAM, as the Pixel 10 could only receive 12GB.

It appears the Pixel Watch 4's left-side slots are for mounting onto this dock so that it stays in place.</p><p>In theory, this new charging dock will keep the watch display visible while charging on a desk or nightstand, so you can quickly check its charging progress. It'll also be interesting to see if the Pixel Watch 4 attaches to this new dock more seamlessly than the Pixel Watch 3 did; some Watch 3 owners complained about the pin system being hard to attach.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4" name="Pixel-Watch-renders-04" alt="Pixel Watch 4 renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e3PYr2agAyyZbgGq7Ajey4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks/ via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If this leak is accurate, it'll be the third proprietary cable across four generations of Pixel Watches; the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-review">first Pixel Watch</a> used a magnetic cable before the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-2-review">Watch 2</a> adopted pins.</p><p>While this will create more e-waste with now-useless cables, the leaked report suggests that this redesign makes the Pixel Watch 4 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-could-finally-tackle-whats-been-holding-googles-wearables-back">easier to repair</a>, whereas the first three generations couldn't be taken apart for repair, only replaced with a new model.

We're curious if accessory makers will be able to make one that doesn't block off the charging pins but still offers the same level of protection.</p><p>It'll also be important to see how the Watch 4 charging speed changes; currently, the Pixel Watch 3 41mm takes 24 minutes to 50% or 60 minutes to 100%, while the Watch 3 45mm takes 28 and 80 minutes, respectively.</p><h2 id="waiting-on-qi-charging-for-android-watches-2">Waiting on Qi charging for Android watches</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-charging.jpeg" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3, charging close to 100%" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6KK5ZakhZd9zw3z8K2nKML.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Smartwatch owners know the pain of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearable-charging-is-an-unsolvable-mess">proprietary chargers</a>. You get one cable in the box, and if you lose it or leave it at home during a vacation, your watch suddenly becomes useless; the replacement is expensive and often isn't available on Amazon for faster shipping.</p><p>Why can't we demand a universal Qi charging standard for watches, like we have with smartphones and USB-C?

What immediately catches your eye is a banner that reads, "Google Pixel Watch 4 with Gemini." That seems to be the highlight of this leak, as another alleged promo image teases the AI model as a "quick AI assistant" for whatever you need.</p><p>The leak claims Gemini's presence on the Watch 4 will be there to give users "personalized help" and also provide "text suggestions" that "sound like you." Gemini will likely leverage some sort of "understanding" and context around how you usually speak to it to offer these AI-based suggestions. Or it could just be fancy talk—we'll see during launch.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Watch 4 is rumored to feature the Pixel Watch 3's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/loss-of-pulse-detection-is-finally-rolling-out-to-pixel-watch-3-users-in-the-us">Loss of Pulse</a> detection.</p><p>This was a feature that hit the Watch 3 in April <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/loss-of-pulse-detection-is-finally-rolling-out-to-pixel-watch-3-users-in-the-us">after the FDA cleared it</a> in February. If the Pixel Watch 3 doesn't detect your heartbeat for an extended period of time, it will alert emergency services on your behalf, explaining the situation. Additionally, there are supposedly "40 plus exercise modes," as well as the ability to build "custom run plans."</p><h2 id="a-look-into-the-pixel-watch-4-2">A look into the Pixel Watch 4</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">⌚️ pic.twitter.com/kWaR9yGpat<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1953628307678761047">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>The leaks also had something to say about the Pixel Watch 4's specifications. The supposed images reiterate what we've heard before about a 41mm and a 45mm variation for the device. However, we're getting a glimpse into its battery, which claims to sit at ~30 hours (41mm) and ~40 hours (45mm). The leaks state these estimations take into account the AOD (always-on display).</p><p>If true, this is already higher than what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> offers. Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3_specs?hl=en-US#:~:text=Power%20(Battery%20and%20Charging)">model delivers</a> "up to" 24 hours for both sizes with AOD active. With it off, users will likely go further with their watch.</p><p>The tipster also alleges a few health sensor capabilities, like ECG, breathing rate, and HRV.</p><p>As previously stated, we're just coming off the back of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-is-center-stage-colors-design-renders-leaked">several leaked Pixel Watch 4 renders</a> that seemingly gave us our best look yet at it. While it's been rumored for months now that Google will keep the glass-domed design the same, the Watch 4's alleged renders hinted at thinner bezels for a larger screen. These leaks clued us into the potential colors for the 41mm, which could include Iris, Lemongrass, Porcelain, and Obsidian.</p><p>The 45mm has been rumored to provide Moonstone, Porcelain, and Obsidian. Those images from earlier this week didn't give us a look at the watch's supposed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-leaked-charging-cable-dock-rumor">"side-mounted" charging</a>, as older rumors suggest the Watch 4 does not have its old charging pins on the back. The Made by Google event is slated for August 20.</p> ]]></dc:content>

To me, it's wild that people spend thousands of dollars on the latest and greatest tech only to skimp out on charging solutions. I spend real money on USB-C cables for this reason, getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">the best cords on the market</a>. On the other end of the spectrum, brands that think up unique ways to innovate the boring USB-C charger always catch my attention.</p><p>That's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/heres-why-your-next-usb-c-cable-should-have-a-screen">why I've used a USB-C cable with a screen</a> for years, and it's also why I couldn't wait to try Satechi's new OntheGo USB-C lanyard charger. The concept is exactly what it sounds like — it's a lanyard that can hold your ID badges and access cards like usual, but it also doubles as a 1.5-meter-long braided USB-C cable with metal endcaps. Usually, I'd write something like this off as a gimmick, but this one can handle 60W fast-charging duty and even supports data transfer.</p><p>At only $30, it's a neat and useful gadget for the right person.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="snXskMdk7e9M5stVdX9Dsb" name="Satechi-USB-Lanyard-2" alt="The Satechi Lanyard USB-C cable." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/snXskMdk7e9M5stVdX9Dsb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The lanyard has a somewhat odd design that doubles-back on itself, so you actually have two cords hanging across your neck. If you can get past that look, you might love the Satechi OntheGo USB-C lanyard. Pull either end of the cord loops and you can extend the hidden charger to its full length. Then, pop off the aluminum end caps (which stay tethered to the lanyard) and you're off and charging.</p><h2 id="a-must-have-accessory-for-lanyard-wearers-2">A must-have accessory for lanyard wearers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4vTRaZ5TYS4JUoBgcnxBAQ" name="Satechi-USB-Lanyard-3" alt="The Satechi Lanyard USB-C cable." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4vTRaZ5TYS4JUoBgcnxBAQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Believe it or not, the lanyard doesn't look too strange hanging from your neck. The braided cloth material and aluminum hardware look much more premium than the lanyards you commonly see around. Unfortunately, you can't hang the lanyard from your pocket or bag as well, simply because the cables are too heavy.</p><p>I think there's a purpose for this kind of unique charger for two reasons. First of all, it's not overpriced — $30 is about what you'd pay for a good 60W cable and lanyard separately. On top of that, there's value in having a hidden charger built into something you already carry with you. I can't count the number of times I've had a fully-charged laptop and a dead phone with no USB-C cable to fill the gap. Carrying something like the OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable would solve that pain point once and for all.</p><p>It'd be most useful for people who need to wear a lanyard daily anyway. When I was a student, I had to wear a school ID daily — it was a requirement. It would've been really cool to have a charger ready to go as part of my lanyard, making this a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/back-to-school-your-ultimate-shopping-guide">great back-to-school purchase</a>. If you have an access card for work, this lanyard could come in handy for that, too.</p><p>Personally, I'm going to use this for my Tesla keycard, so I have a backup for unlocking my car <em>and</em> charging up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">my favorite Android devices</a>. The Satechi OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable might not be for everyone, but I definitely want to see accessory brands keep coming out with unique offerings like this one.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="cf9d5dc8-c1ba-4e0c-bf56-d0f0edeaf868">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YiaR652CvhfLRREwKdYVA9.jpg' alt="The Satechi lanyard loop in a white product render."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Satechi OntheGo USB-C Lanyard</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A lanyard with a twist</strong></em></p><p>Satechi's OntheGo USB-C lanyard cable will hold your cards and charge up your phone.

One user on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ma6hpa/im_the_3rd_one_posting_this_for_this_month_pixel/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">Reddit</a>, earlier this month, reported their Pixel 6a caught fire overnight while charging. The phone was reportedly on a nightstand just 40cm away from where they were sleeping, and the fire even damaged nearby sheets and flooring. Despite having installed Google's mandatory fix, the battery still failed.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-6a-part-you-need-the-most-back-on-ifixit-s-shelves-2">The Pixel 6a part you need the most back on iFixit's shelves</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tUgsXBlJCxU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google has offered help in the form of free replacements for affected devices and, in some cases, $150 cash compensation. But for those living in regions without Google's repair support — or for anyone wanting to get the repair done right away — there's now a DIY option.</p><p>As spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1mjze8u/pixel_6a_users_impacted_by_the_battery_update/">Reddit</a> user (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-pixel-6a-battery-kits-finally-resurface-on-ifixit/">Android Police</a>), iFixit has restocked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/products/google-pixel-6a-battery-genuine">battery replacement kits</a> for the Pixel 6a. For those unaware, iFixit offers genuine Pixel repair parts and sells them standalone for DIY repairs. The Pixel 6a battery had been out of stock, likely due to low demand and the battery issues, but iFixit now seems to have resolved this.</p><p>These kits include everything you need to replace the battery yourself, along with step-by-step <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Google+Pixel+6a+Battery+Replacement/152516">written instructions</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUgsXBlJCxU">detailed YouTube tutorial</a> to guide you through the process.</p><p>I'd still recommend going to an official Google repair store to get your Pixel 6a fixed, but if that's not possible and you want to dive in yourself, you now can.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you're looking for the latest-generation option, you may want to wait until the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 series</a> release, which is slated for August 20.

Much of this is related to the design, an area where the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE struggles against its chief rival in the US.</p><p>It’s perfect if you want a no-frills flip phone, but if you want a phone that elicits emotion, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE falls short. At a lower price than at launch, it could be a fantastic deal, as long as the Flip 6 isn’t also discounted.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-price-and-availability"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE: Price and availability</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2313px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TrjhzdR9CMBufJJ65cA22K" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-FE-review-Android-Central-7" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE in Black in the hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrjhzdR9CMBufJJ65cA22K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2313" height="1301" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nirave Gondhia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE starts at $899.99 for the 128GB version, with the 256GB storage variant costing $60 more. However, at the time of writing, Samsung is currently still running its pre-order promotion, discounting the 256GB version to a lower price.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is available in just two colors — Black and White. Unlike the Flip 6, there are no additional color options, nor any colors exclusive to Samsung’s direct sales channels like its online and physical stores.</p><p>The premise of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is that it’s affordable enough for MVNOs to offer it for free, or close to it. So far, Boost Mobile is the only one to do so, with the carrier offering up to $899 off the handset price with an unlimited data plan from $65 per month. The best part?

If the prices are identical, choose the Galaxy Z Flip 6 for its colors.</p><p>However, it's also wroth considering the Moto Razr 2025. This is one of my favorite phones right now as Motorola's approach to the Cover Screen is significantly better than Samsung, with the ability to run any app, a host of optimized panels inclduing games, and several tricks to take advantage of the form factor.</p><p>The Razr 2025 is $100 cheaper and available from all major carriers; it also comes in vibrant colors and has better battery and charging.

Plus, at $300 lower than the Flip 7, it’s a compelling offering. However, it is not as convincing when you consider the alternatives, such as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 or Razr 2025.</p><p>Overall, while the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE is a fairly confusing product, it’s a solid phone on its own but hampered by last year’s Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the excellent Galaxy Z Flip 7. Against the growing competition, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE struggles to stand out even though it’s a good, if unspectacular, folding phone.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="a3b5c469-cc7a-469b-8e23-4479141da804">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RJwtppW9DAGqVEQUiZRVhP.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A cheaper flip phone</strong></em></p><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE takes the best of the Flip 6 and brings a new chip and comes at a cheaper launch price.

There was a time when other brands like LG, HTC, and even Sony Xperia were part of the conversation. But most of these companies have either <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/its-official-lg-exiting-smartphone-business">exited the smartphone space</a> or stopped selling their devices in the U.S.</p><p>At one point, it even seemed like the end of the road for Sony, especially when the company began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony/sony-outsourced-production-xperia-line-report">outsourcing Xperia smartphone production</a> to third-party manufacturers. However, it looks like Sony isn't done just yet.</p><p>During the financial results call this week in Japan, Sony CFO Lin Tao stated that the smartphone business is "an extremely important business for us" and that the company intends to "nurture" it (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://japan.cnet.com/article/35236485/">CNET Japan</a>).</p><h2 id="xperia-lives-on-at-least-according-to-sony-2">Xperia lives on, at least according to Sony</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="uaWeD3CqZPHaShuRSosMUX" name="sony-xperia-1-review-in-hand.jpg" alt="A Sony Xperia smartphone in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uaWeD3CqZPHaShuRSosMUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>Tao emphasized that "communication technology" is a key area Sony has cultivated for a long time and that it wants to continue valuing its smartphone business.</p><p>This statement comes on the heels of a recent issue, where Sony had to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sony.jp/xperia/support/software/update/info/20250704_xperia1vii.html">recall units of the Xperia 1 VII</a> in Japan due to a shutdown bug. Tao opened the earnings call by saying, "We apologize for the huge inconvenience to our users," but also reiterated the company's continued focus on smartphones.</p><p>Since the issue first surfaced, the company has started replacing the affected Xperia 1 VII devices.</p><p>That said, Xperia smartphones have struggled, even in Sony's home market of Japan, where Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-imagination-studio-k-pop-collab-teasers">Pixel lineup has gained</a> significant traction. While Sony continues to offer features like a microSD card slot and a 3.5mm headphone jack, even in its latest flagship phones, the high price of Xperia flagships has been a major barrier for many buyers.</p><p>The company still sells select Xperia models in global markets like Europe, but they remain a rare sight.</p><p>So what does Tao's statement really mean? Well, your guess is as good as ours, but it does seem like Sony isn't giving up on smartphones just yet.</p> ]]></dc:content>

As for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold,  the alleged promo video zooms in on the hinge of the device and shows the inner display with thinner bezels, giving it a bit more screen space than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold. </a></p><p>Finally, the video of the supposed Pixel Watch 4 showcases the wearable in full.

With seconds to spare, I cleaned up my fingerprints, stashed the mystery man's belongings, and slowly opened the door to greet two officers who had weapons drawn on me.</p><p>Just 30 seconds later, I was pronounced innocent and allowed to go on my merry old way.

The game has over half a dozen levels, each with at least six different places to hide the mystery man Gus's corpse.</p><p>Despite what the subject matter might make you think, Hide the Corpse is a strangely family-friendly title that has no foul language, no violence (other than dragging a corpse around, I suppose), and little else that might trigger you to hide its existence in front of your kids.</p><p>That, of course, meant that my son and I spent hours laughing until we cried as we struggled to drag around Gus's insanely heavy corpse without running into the furniture in our real living room. Seriously, it's a hilariously good time that's guaranteed to make you laugh.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="obm7TPnxq3z2bjcxLAZqyY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

Even more so given that you only have four minutes to somehow bring him to a legit hiding spot and cram him into whatever dimensions said spot allows.</p><p>The intro level takes place in an apartment where you can hide Gus in strangely conspicuous places like the bathtub, the armoire, under the bed, and three other spots I don't want to ruin. You'd think the cops would find him in these places, but they're, thankfully, no Sherlock Holmes.</p><p>The goal is to just hide Gus's corpse from plain sight, a goal that becomes zanier and zanier as you progress through the levels. And I promise that you never realized how heavy a corpse could be in zero gravity until you get to the space level!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N6Ko5Ekyu38qQb9uC6Gw2Z" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-02" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest.

The man somehow has several of his belongings scattered randomly in each level, including his comb, wallet, favorite record (this is 70s themed), driver's license, and a few other nicknacks. Each of these also needs to be hidden from plain sight to get the best score.</p><p>Oh, and don't forget to erase <em>every single one</em> of the fingerprints you left along the way. Seriously, those little blue fingerprints appear on anything you've touched, even if you didn't realize you'd touched it. It's an almost overwhelming amount of stuff to do in just four minutes, but it results in some gratifying gameplay in a short span.</p><p>When the time is up, either at the four-minute mark or when you open the door for the cops, you'll get graded on your performance. I'm not sure who grades someone on their ability to hide a corpse, but I hope I never run across them in real life.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY" name="hide-the-corpse-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Hide the Corpse for Meta Quest showing the cops finding Gus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EuRAN3MDRSaRSNEww3bHsY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="810" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HyperVR Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Once you find enough hiding spots in each level, you'll unlock a new level to play in. The scenarios are incredibly varied, ranging from the apartment you start in to the diner I spoke of earlier, a zero-gravity space station, an art museum, and more. The latest update in mid-July added a ton of new modifiers, including a <strong>heavier</strong> Gus and the ability to double the hiding time.</p><h2 id="alone-or-with-friends-it-s-a-riot-2">Alone or with friends, it's a riot</h2><p>While it's a single-player game, I found it to be the most fun when casting the gameplay to a TV while others in the room were watching. This <em>always</em> elicited people asking to try it and then spending multiple sessions in the game until someone pried the headset from their cold, not-dead hands. Definitely not dead. That only happens in the game.</p><p>It's the kind of zany, whimsical, unique fun that I love seeing from indie developers and a reminder of the late 90s and early 2000s era of gaming, where just about any theme or concept could make a game, no matter how surreal or ridiculous. Plus, at just $15, it's tough to say no to for a few fantastic hours of entertainment with friends and family.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Initially, the video explains the difficulties with removing the foldable's display, as Samsung introduced "heatless back panel removal," which caused too many issues. Thus, they were forced to gain entry near its cameras.</p><p>Removing the first battery is like moving through a maze—if the maze consisted of cables, screws (and more screws), and press connectors. The first battery, or rather, how Samsung implemented its removal process, was another gripe for iFixit. The video states the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-hands-on">Fold 7</a> features a thin pull tab. While this seems useful, iFixit states the tabs need "too much force" and could end up tearing.</p><p>More than that, if you're <em>too </em>forceful with the tab, you could bend the battery and risk ruining it.</p><p>After popping out the motherboard (yet another maze), iFixit gets to the camera. This is important as, according to iFixit, Samsung used a similar structure that it has other models. However, this means that a "full disassembly" of your device is required if something goes wrong with the camera.</p><h2 id="night-terrors-of-an-inner-screen-2">Night Terrors of an Inner Screen</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9KhF6emBjbE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The inner display of the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is probably going to be the worst nightmare any would-be repairperson would ever see. The teardown explains that the inner display is the more "fragile" aspect of this device, and that's only magnified when you consider Samsung's recent advancements to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-says-galaxy-z-fold-7-screen-decade-long-durability-report">help it reach 500,000 folds</a> (~10 years). The bezels are glued in, forcing iFixit to take uncomfortable means to remove them.</p><p>Moreover, the company states that you'd only ever remove the inner display if it's already damaged. This is because the inner screen is "sensitive to pressure and torsional rotation," so by the end of this teardown, the screen was more or less down and out.</p><p>Let's hope nothing goes wrong with your Fold 7 inner display, as iFixit states it would cost consumers a whopping $589 to replace it. You can check out <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/9KhF6emBjbE">the rest of iFixit's teardown</a> on the Fold 7 and see what happens to warrant its 3 out of 10 repairability score.</p><h2 id="tedious-difficult-2">Tedious, difficult</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4527px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review-19" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kWuw6f5DH4oNFJTE2JBtS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4527" height="2546" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The mention of glued-down parts in the Galaxy Z Fold 7 teardown reminds us of why <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ifixit-samsung-partnership-concludes">iFixit cut ties with Samsung</a> last year. The company said it made this decision as its ideals over repairability for consumers didn't align with Samsung's. Its announcement said that Samsung's devices are "glued together."

After its initial debut in 2020, Samsung moved the series from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsungs-galaxy-s20-series-wont-get-any-more-monthly-updates">monthly updates to quarterly</a> patches in 2024. This came in March last year, as Samsung started shifting away from that four-year-old series in favor of the (at the time) new Galaxy S24 series. The company also already met its previous agreement of three major Android OS upgrades, going from Android 10 to 13 in 2022.</p><p>After spending over a year with quarterly patches, Samsung delivered its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s20-series-software-updates-samsung-support-ends">final security patch to the series</a> in April 2025 (or so we thought).</p><p>The company's security page no longer lists the main Galaxy S20 series after that update in April. It seemed to suggest that Samsung was done with the trio, considering its removal, but this new update for Q3 2025 goes against that. Perhaps now we've received the final patch. The Galaxy S20 FE was held separate from the main flagship group; however, its intended update for Q3 2025 might be its last.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, you might have wished to see an OLED display, but the LCD panel is still crisp thanks to its 1920 x 1200 resolution.</p><p>What about performance? Well, the Tab A9+ is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 695, paired with 4GB of RAM and up to 128GB of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">expandable storage</a>. As for battery life, the Tab A9+ will just keep chugging along, as its  7,040mAh battery is rated for up to 20 hours on a single charge.</p><p>You'll also enjoy some surprising features, such as split-screen multitasking, Gaming Hub, and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-should-make-dex-tablet-default">Samsung DeX</a>. So not only can use the Tab A9+ as a traditional tablet, but plug it into a monitor, and have a desktop-like experience.</p><p>The only glaring issue that I can see with the Galaxy Tab A9+ is its lack of S Pen support. That's definitely a bummer, but there are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-stylus-android-phones-and-tablets">other stylus options</a> out there that can help fill the void if you want to use this as a digital notebook.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/how-galaxy-watchs-innovative-sensor-breaks-new-ground-in-preventative-care">blog post</a>, the company states consumers with a Galaxy Watch 8 will have access to its Ectopic Beat Detection software for "actionable" insights. Samsung states this feature is designed to help users detect early signs of "premature heartbeats."</p><p>These early heartbeats, which is states can typically go unnoticed during routine checkups, can lead to arrhythmia and potentially evolve into a risk of heart failure.</p><p>The post highlights the Galaxy Watch 8's "enhanced" ECG sensor and its ability to inform users if it detects signs of ectopic beats.</p><p>Vascular Load is another preventative care feature Samsung has packed into the Galaxy Watch 8. This was a feature it teased a little before the devices launched in July, touting it as an AI-powered feature designed to determine the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/i-think-samsung-health-likely-to-get-ai-subscription-soon">strain on your heart</a>." Today, Samsung says that the watches utilize PPG waveforms to measure your blood flow and vascular stiffness throughout the night.</p><p>Samsung reports that daily stress, diet, and how much rest you get can affect this aspect of your health. If left unchecked, it could lead to more serious cardiovascular concerns.</p><h2 id="changing-lifestyle-habits-2">Changing Lifestyle Habits</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-antioxidant-index-fruits-and-veggies" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on a person's wrist showing the Antioxidant Index widget with a "Low" score, held in front of two bowls containing colorful fruits and veggies." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/D6vjSqfonSvkje2X3yrZUE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from an early warning system, Samsung says the Galaxy Watch 8 can also help users make well-informed decisions about their lifestyle. For example, the series features an "Antioxidant Index," which uses its BioActive sensors to scan your skin carotenoids. What this returns is a well-informed look into antioxidant levels, primarily based on the amount of fruits and vegetables you've consumed.</p><p>Users are given a score between 0-100. While Samsung says low fruit and vegetable intake can negatively impact this score (and your health overall), other factors like your diet, UV light exposure, and more can impact your antioxidant levels.</p><p>Additionally, "Bedtime Guidance" is designed to help users "build healthier sleep routines that lead to deeper, less interrupted sleep and more energized mornings." Samsung says this was developed alongside KAIST to help users understand their bodies and the right amount of sleep for them.</p><h2 id="the-galaxy-watch-8-aid-right-on-your-wrist-2">The Galaxy Watch 8: aid right on your wrist</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-watch-8-classic-watch-ultra-2-hands-on-4" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 antioxidant measuring results with Samsung Health on Fold 7 hands-on" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AZB6LwhrYbHgfNMYZPo8aG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung has been pushing the Galaxy Watch 8's health features, as we've seen with its Preventative Care (early detection) and lifestyle monitoring capabilities.

Meta's 2023 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/reality-labs-shows-off-prototypes">Butterscotch Varifocal prototype</a> was the first to achieve 60 PPD, the "retinal resolution" threshold required to clearly render the 20/20 line of an eye chart.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1326px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V" name="Meta-Tiramisu-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of the Meta Tiramisu prototype on a man's face, a VR headset with a longer-than average design jutting out nearly a foot." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o6tidfKWp5vCoTFeEP6W8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1326" height="746" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta Tiramisu </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Tiramisu's ultra-bright, high-res prototype crushes the retinal resolution threshold by an extra 30 PPD. The trade-off is that it only hits 33 degrees FoV, well below the range for proper immersion. They also "deprioritized the form factor," says OPALS scientist Xuan Wang, with heavier glass lenses for the best visual fidelity on par with HDR TVs.</p><p>Tiramisu would be inordinately expensive and uncomfortable for consumers. But it's a physical and metaphorical window into Reality Labs' investment in true visual immersion for future headsets. We wonder if it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/james-cameron-thinks-vr-is-definitive-way-to-watch-his-movies">"f***ing cool" prototypes James Cameron tried</a> that got him invested in VR filmmaking with Meta.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV" name="Meta-Boba-3-prototype-SIGGRAPH-2025" alt="A photo of a man wearing the Meta Boba 3 prototype headset with a finger raised to tap a virtual object." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kKz2RmqXERRovsiAWQsYCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Boba 3 prototype, on the other hand, looks more polished and practical, though still a premium device. Developed by the Reality Labs Display Systems Research (DSR) team, it hits a 180-degree horizontal field of view (FoV) and 120-degree vertical FoV, using pancake lenses to keep it reasonably light at 660g.</p><p>It also uses "high-curvature reflective polarizers" to prevent light reflection, a necessity given that the curved display essentially points at itself along the edge.</p><p>Boba 3 delivers 30 PPD, slightly better than the Quest 3, but hitting 4K x 4K resolution with such a wide display has an incredible power demand, says DSR scientist Yang Zhao. Boba 3 "requires a top-of-the-line GPU and PC system" to fill all of that visual space; it's "not going to easily hit a mass-market price point," nor work as an all-in-one Quest-type product.</p><p>Still, it's impressive to see how the Boba 3 prototype covers 90% of the "FOV of the human visual system," to the point that you'd barely see any darkness around the display.</p><h2 id="will-the-meta-quest-4-follow-these-prototypes-example-2">Will the Meta Quest 4 follow these prototypes' example?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV" name="Meta-Boba-VR-prototypes" alt="A photo of Meta's prototype Boba 1, Boba 2, and Boba 3 headsets from left to right on a table, showing how they've gotten much smaller over time." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NmDJXz88WTPt4c2zZgLVCV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Boba 1, 2, and 3 prototypes </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The blog post stresses that these are "purely research prototypes, with novel technologies that may never make their way into a consumer product."</p><p>But even if the Quest 4 can't match them, we can certainly hope it'll follow in these prototypes' footsteps and aspire to greater visual fidelity. Or if not, maybe the Quest 5 will.</p><p>"We’re working to figure out what lies beyond television and laptop screens," says DSR Director Douglas Lanman. "We’re just trying to make something awesome—not just as a demo, but as something that we’d use every day. And that really is the true Turing test: Are we excited about what we’re doing after a decade of doing it?"</p><p>Meta, as a company, is definitely interested in replacing TVs with its headsets. Meta's head of Oculus Publishing said earlier this year that by 2027, Meta wants to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">target young adults who will use the Quest as a "high-end TV."</a></p><p>It's a natural assumption that the Quest 4 will need to deliver better resolution and FoV to make its entertainment experience more dynamic. Its designers may have looked to OPALS and DSR for technical inspiration.</p><p>But the Quest 4 must also be light enough to be worn for hours and affordable enough that consumers will buy it. We'll see if it successfully hits that balance.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Furthermore, the foldable is powered by the same Tensor G4 chipset that drives the rest of the Pixel 9 series, and you'll also get the same seven years of guaranteed OS and security support. </p><p>The trade-offs include some relatively disappointing camera tech (it's passable, but nothing amazing) and a lack of stylus support. These wouldn't be major issues on a different phone, but at this price I want to be blown away, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold just isn't as performant as we wanted in those regards. </p><p>With the imminent arrival of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold on August 20th (not to mention the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review#section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-software">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> from Samsung), last year's model could easily go overlooked.

After all, it's not like we expect the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to be <em>that</em> different from its predecessor, so why not go last-gen and save some serious cash in the process?</p> ]]></dc:content>

The triple camera array is off to one side of the phone, with its placement looking a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-vs-google-pixel-9-pro-apple-or-google">iPhone 16 Pro</a>. The image shows the device in a silver/white colorway, contrary to previous rumors of it launching in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-15-battery-leak-3569929/">SuperBlack color option </a>that makes the device look like a “black hole,” which is said to absorb 99.9% of all visible light.</p><p>This leak reinforces the fact that the triple camera setup (wide, ultra-wide, and 3x periscope) would feature 50MP lenses and a periscope telephoto lens, which could be as high as 200MP, according to a previous leak on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PwM6XAI07">Weibo</a>.</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1mizj4f/oneplus_15_redesigned_hasselblad_camera_flagship">OnePlus 15: Redesigned Hasselblad Camera Flagship & Key Specs Leaked</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus">r/oneplus</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>We also know that OnePlus could potentially be letting go of its long-term relationship with Hasselblad, which could be the reason behind the redesign.</p><p>The Reddit post also mentions the alleged key specs of the device. Regarding the phone's screen, the tipster claims that the OnePlus 15 will feature a flat 1.5K AMOLED display with ultra-thin bezels, using LIPO display technology, measuring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-leak-drops-some-spicy-changes-and-not-in-a-good-way-for-everyone">6.7 inches</a>. Additionally, the device is said to feature a<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-specs-chipset-camera-leaks"> "symmetrical front,"</a> meaning that all four bezels—top, bottom, and sides—are of equal or near-equal thickness, creating a cleaner design aesthetic, much like Apple's iPhones.</p><p>Under the hood, the device is said to have the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite 2</a>, rumored to be launching in September this year.

The Watch 8 comes in two sizes of 40mm and 44mm, with prices starting at $349.99 and $379.99, respectively. The 40mm Galaxy Watch 8 features a 325mAh battery, and the 44mm version has a 435mAh capacity. Despite the difference in capacities, though, Samsung estimates up to 40 hours of runtime on one charge for both sizes. With the Always-on Display (AOD) feature enabled, this is said to drop to 30 hours.</p><p>While we've not yet tested the Galaxy Watch 8, we have finished our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-review">review of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic</a>, which comes in a single 46mm dial size with a 445mAh battery.  Interestingly, Samsung has the same battery life estimates for the Classic as well. In our testing, we found the Watch 8 Classic to last for roughly 25 hours when really pushed, but it's usually double that when usage is light.</p><p>Since the 44mm version of the Galaxy Watch 8 has nearly the same capacity as the Watch 8 Classic, you should expect a similar battery life too. The same would apply to the 40mm version, too, since the smaller battery will be powering a smaller display. Overall, you should expect the Watch 8 to easily last an average of 1–2 days between charges, as do most of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a>.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="d3ec1869-e255-4699-9ac5-2069455a1e1d">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bPLi3GK48NDVrnUA6ydiWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A good starter option</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 has a new design and some cool new health tracking features.

No, the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 isn't perfect. It is, however, another few steps closer to the "endgame" for clamshell foldables — a slab phone you can fold in half without losing much. Instead of talking about the Galaxy Z Flip 7 in terms of compromises, we're now looking at all the exclusive features and capabilities it offers compared to normal phones.</p><p>If you recently picked up a new Galaxy Z Flip 7, or are thinking of buying one, you'll want to do these 10 things immediately after unboxing it. They cover everything from the basics, to exclusive Samsung foldable features, to useful AI tools. Some are new to the Galaxy Z Flip 7, and others have been staples of past Galaxy Z Flip models.</p><p>But every single one represents an essential tip or trick that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> owners need to know.

They include setting up your biometrics, downloading your preferred password manager, and logging into your Google and Samsung accounts. You should also check for early updates by going to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Software update</strong> > <strong>Download and install</strong>. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-new-foldables-get-first-update-just-days-after-launch" target="_blank">has already received its first OTA update</a>, so be sure to install it.</p><p>We'd also recommend tweaking your phone's settings to match your preferences. A common frustration with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/my-8-favorite-things-about-the-one-ui-8-beta">One UI 8</a> is a change to lock screen notifications that shows icons instead of banners by default.

Personally, I always turn off <strong>Adaptive brightness</strong> on my phones and even switch on <strong>Extra brightness</strong>. Sometimes, I'll swap out Samsung Keyboard for Gboard.</p><p>Whatever your list of base-level Android modifications is, make sure you handle those before moving to anything else.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-customize-the-cover-screen"><span>Customize the cover screen</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-vs-Flip-6-Cover-Screen-3" alt="The cover screen experience on the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 compared to the Galaxy Z Flip 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NGZUhPJp2GBY6x54KGaxCS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 has a larger, 4.1-inch cover screen that tries to make it easier to view glanceable information and take actions without opening your phone. In my experience, that effort falls flat because <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-cover-screen-is-somehow-worse-than-the-flip-6">certain cover screen options are gone in One UI 8</a> on the Flip 7. Still, there are a handful of things you can do to make the cover screen your own.</p><p>To do so, you can start by swiping to a widget panel on the cover screen, holding it, and pressing the <strong>Edit</strong> button. This will require you to open the phone, and it'll open up a Settings page for the cover screen. Alternatively, you can open the <strong>Settings </strong>app and tap <strong>Cover screen</strong> with the display open to get to this same spot. This is where you can manage widgets, lock screen and clock, notifications, and cover screen timeout.</p><p>After tapping the <strong>Widgets</strong> tab, you can start customizing your cover screen. Most widgets will be either 2x2 or 2x4 in size, so you can fit either two or four widgets per panel. Some third-party app widgets are supported on the cover screen, like Spotify, but these are the exception, not the rule. You can pick any widgets you like — I have Samsung Health, Sleep, Weather, News, Voice Recorder, and Battery on my cover screen.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-enable-cover-screen-apps-with-multistar"><span>Enable cover screen apps with MultiStar</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Cover-Screen-2" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 in black." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NvH7PCi7foMaDkAYZ8v2LH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Apps aren't fully supported on the Galaxy Z Flip 7 cover screen, no matter what you install or which Labs features you enable. However, there are a few things you can do to make the experience usable. The first thing to do is add the <strong>Apps</strong> widget to your cover screen using the steps in the section above. This will give you a small home screen launcher with only a select few official apps — on my Flip 7, the only options are Google Maps, Google Messages, and (oddly) YouTube.</p><p>To find this page from anywhere, you can search <strong>Apps allowed on cover screen</strong> in the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</p><p>At the bottom of the screen, there's a <strong>Get MultiStar</strong> button that you should press if you want to run more cover screen apps. This will enable what is called the <strong>Launcher Widget</strong>, an experimental option that lets you run virtually any app on the cover screen.  I use the Tesla app on the cover screen of my Flip 7 to precondition my car without unfolding it. We have a complete guide to running apps on Galaxy Z Flip cover screens <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-set-up-and-use-apps-on-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-cover-screen">here</a>.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-try-out-flex-mode"><span>Try out Flex Mode</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-22" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2J9YmCizujpTX4f3qA6Tn8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-force-flex-mode-apps-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3">Flex Mode</a> is one of my favorite ways to use Samsung foldables, and it's a Galaxy Z Flip 7 essential. The way it works is simple. Open the foldable about halfway and rest it on a table, sort of like a laptop. Then, a small icon will float in the bottom-left corner of your screen. Tap it, and you'll see the Flex Mode user interface take over.</p><p>The Flex Mode experience will differ slightly depending on what's on your screen at the time. Some apps natively support Flex Mode, like YouTube, so you'll see video on the top half of the screen and playback controls, comments, and the description on the bottom. Other media apps might not, but One UI 8 creates a Flex Mode interface for it anyway.

The rear camera on this phone <em>is</em> your selfie camera, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-flip-phones-my-favorite-camera-tricks">versatility is one of the best parts of daily driving a foldable</a>. To try it, open the camera from the cover screen just like you would on any Android phone. There are multiple ways to do so, including a double-press of the power button.</p><p>Don't just use it for selfies — get creative. Your Galaxy Z Flip 7 can also be used as a tripod thanks to its folding form factor. Next, try <strong>Cover screen preview</strong> —  it's the Flip 7 icon in the top-right corner of the camera app when unfolded. It'll show a preview of the viewfinder on the cover screen, so your subject can see how they look before you snap a picture.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="WRrERqDHeGkDgyGqYnETX9" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-12" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WRrERqDHeGkDgyGqYnETX9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't sleep on <strong>Camcorder mode</strong> — a fun way to take videos like it's the 2000s again.

That’s essentially what Google DeepMind's new AI model, Genie 3, can do.</p><p>Genie 3 is a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-vision-world-model-explained">world model AI that understands how environments work</a> and can simulate them. Unlike Genie 1 and 2, though, it can create diverse, interactive worlds on the fly from a quick text prompt, Google said in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/genie-3-a-new-frontier-for-world-models/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>Instead of just spitting out video or images based on text prompts, Genie 3 can now build interactive 3D scenes that you can actually move around in on the fly. You type something in, and within seconds, you’re dropped into a 720p, 24 FPS virtual world that responds to your actions and even holds its shape for several minutes.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">What if you could not only watch a generated video, but explore it too? 🌐Genie 3 is our groundbreaking world model that creates interactive, playable environments from a single text prompt.From photorealistic landscapes to fantasy realms, the possibilities are endless. 🧵 pic.twitter.com/P0cwFvf5d2<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1952732150928724043">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><h2 id="big-upgrade-from-genies-1-and-2-2">Big upgrade from Genies 1 and 2</h2><p>Earlier versions could only hold things together for 10 to 20 seconds before the scene fell apart. On the other hand, Genie 3 steps it up by keeping objects and spaces intact for over a minute, so if you walk out and come back, everything’s still in place.</p><p>In the demo below, a pair of virtual arms rolled blue paint onto a wall. After a few broad strokes, the view shifted away, then back, revealing the paint still exactly where it was left. So, it’s not just flashy visual output, but an actual, dynamic space.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="aKtEoXoxFcejx85vbdjx3A" name="Genie-3-demo" alt="POV action camera of a tan house being painted by a first person agent with a paintroller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aKtEoXoxFcejx85vbdjx3A.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What really sets Genie 3 apart is that it isn’t manually coded to obey real-world physics.

It’s still in research preview and only available to a small group of academics and creators. The interaction mechanics are pretty basic for now, and it can’t really handle multiple agents running around at the same time.</p><p>It also doesn’t create accurate real-world replicas or readable in-world text. And while the tech is impressive, these scenes are built to last minutes, not hours, so don’t expect a full-blown open-world game experience just yet.</p><p>Still, Genie 3 is a big step forward in AI simulation. While it’s not ready for public use, it’s giving us a glimpse of where things are headed, especially in the push toward more general forms of artificial intelligence.</p> ]]></dc:content>
