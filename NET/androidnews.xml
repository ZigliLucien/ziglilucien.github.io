                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>An APK teardown of the recent Google app beta shows Google is planning to move the location of "Trusted Places" and improve its management capabilities.</li><li>The feature was spotted within your device's Location settings and its home page offers clearer adding, adjusting, and deletion functionality.</li><li>There is speculation that Trusted Places will soon show your "Extend Unlock" settings after Google rolls it out.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Your device security is a hot topic, but Google might improve one setting that helps you feel at ease in places you trust.</p><p>According to an APK teardown by AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-may-make-it-easier-to-manage-the-places-your-phone-stays-unlocked-apk-teardown-3475259/">Android Authority</a>, Google is seemingly preparing to deliver an upgrade to "Trusted Places." Version 24.34.33 of the Google app beta holds signs of better management for such places. The teardown showed that users can soon find the feature easier by heading into <strong>Settings > Location > Trusted Places</strong>.</p><p>From there, users will find the feature listed among several others with the description "tap to manage."</p><p>Doing so will show that the places you trust "are not shared with Google" and are saved on your device. Users can specify certain places at "home," "work," and more through its customization option. The new home for "Trusted Places" comes with a revamped menu as users can add, adjust, and delete locations they no longer need.</p><p>The page also reiterates that "Trusted Places" will provide certain location-based settings based on what you&apos;ve saved. Those <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-add-trusted-place-android-50-lollipop">familiar with the feature</a> since the old days of Android 5 (Lollipop) will know that one of its functions is to keep your phone unlocked at a trusted location.</p><p>The publication states that many of these upgrades and changes aren&apos;t working properly in the teardown. No surprise there as Google is most likely in development still, with no telling when we could expect it. One can hope that it&apos;ll arrive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">with or sometime after Android 15</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:564px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.38%;"><img id="Z9Tsd5f9xA2RJd4v6KNUfC" name="android-trusted-places-new-home-redesign-settings.jpg" alt="A look an Android's "Trusted Settings" new home and management changes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Z9Tsd5f9xA2RJd4v6KNUfC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="564" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>An upgrade for Android&apos;s "Trusted Places" is likely long overdue as it&apos;s (currently) buried in a slew of menus. Moreover, these changes can pair well with Google&apos;s "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/extend-unlock-rebrand-spotted">Extend Unlock</a>." During its rebrand from Smart Lock, it was discovered that the Extended version would "keep this device unlocked while it&apos;s on you, at specific places that you trust, or near your connected devices."</p><p>The publication mentions that the teardown shows a "see all settings that use trusted places" tagline at the bottom. That could indicate a much closer partnership between several of Android&apos;s personal security settings. </p><p>Of course, this is an easy alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-use-wear-os-watch-unlock">Watch Unlock</a> as that feature requires your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch</a> to be nearby to open the phone.</p><p>Android&apos;s "Trusted Places" might feel like a niche feature, especially considering most users will likely want their device locked and secure. However, in the interest of device security, Google is working on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-private-space-full-details">Private Spaces</a> for Android 15. The feature lets users store apps they don&apos;t want others to see in a separate place on their device. Such a feature might work well with Trusted Places as it steps back into frame.</p>

<ul><li>A rumor from a Weibo tipster claims Xiaomi is beginning to develop a tri-fold device to compete with Huawei and Samsung.</li><li>Little information is known about the device's specifics; however, speculation states a prototype could appear during MWC 2025.</li><li>Huawei's upcoming tri-fold phone was spotted with its former CEO, and rumors suggested it could launch in September.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>As more brands pitch their foldable takes, the industry looks to advance towards newer form factors, and now Xiaomi is rumored to enter the fray with its take.</p><p>The latest rumor stems from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/OtV7Ii6Ti">Smart Pikachu</a>, a Weibo tipster who claims Xiaomi is working on a tri-folding phone (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/the-race-for-tri-fold-smartphones-might-be-heating-up-xiaomi-to-jump-in_id161791">PhoneArena</a>). Take this rumor with a grain of salt as the tipster&apos;s post didn&apos;t offer any additional information about other aspects of the device.</p><p>The report adds that Xiaomi could be preparing for a more interesting MWC 2025 showcase if this tri-fold device exists. The publication suggests the Chinese company could show off an early prototype of the foldable to start building interest.</p><p>Other speculation from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/08/26/xiaomis-tri-foldable-phone-in-works-heres-what-to-expect/">Gizmochina</a> states Xiaomi could feature its HyperOS 2.0, the Leica camera system, and Qualcomm&apos;s flagship Snapdragon chip.</p><p>Users have started wondering if Xiaomi will upgrade/improve the crease experience of its foldable if this tri-fold rumor is accurate. Additional posts have started to notice the tri-fold trend as they mention the recent rumors and live photos about Huawei&apos;s version.</p><p>Huawei&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-tri-fold-phone-former-ceo-photographed">tri-fold device</a> was spotted in the hands of its former CEO earlier in August. The device appeared quite large in hand, almost tablet-like, as rumors claimed it may feature a 10-inch display when unfolded. Speculation states Huawei&apos;s tri-fold will likely debut with a "premium price tag" alongside HiSilicon&apos;s Kirin 9 series SoC to power it.</p><p>Interestingly, Huawei <em>and </em>Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-huawei-new-foldable-phone-push">were rumored</a> to have a couple of new foldable prototypes in the works. The devices would take on a "Z" shape. With Huawei&apos;s version seemingly further along, rumors claim it could debut in China in September. Samsung was reportedly working on a "rollable" style foldable, as shown <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">during CES 2024</a>. That showcase was paired with an "In&Out Flip" that could fold its display 360 degrees.</p><p>While we wait to see if this Xiaomi rumor is true, the company launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-confirms-the-launch-date-for-its-galaxy-z-fold-6-contender">new foldable duo</a> in July. The brand debuted the Mix Fold 4 and its first clamshell, the Mix Flip. With the latest rumors about Xiaomi, it seems OEMs are quickly scrambling to bring a third form for its foldables to take on.</p>

<hr>
<p>The next iteration of Android software isn&apos;t coming as soon as you may have thought, at least according to the latest rumor.</p><p>A report about Android 15&apos;s potential launch window stems from Mishaal Rahman (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-pixel-update-3475337/">Android Authority</a>) who states October might be our best bet for the stable version. The newly rumored launch for the next Android OS reportedly comes from an alleged Google source.</p><p>The post adds that Google is supposedly hanging onto Android 15 to "improve its stability." Unsightly problems like this would undoubtedly cause major hiccups for Android devices preparing to receive the new OS. The post doesn&apos;t offer specifics on the problems Google discovered. There were likely more problems beneath its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/final-android-15-beta-4-2-rollout">final Android 15 beta</a> than we realize.</p><p>Rahman <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-source-code-release-3475328/">also reported</a> that Google plans to release the software&apos;s source code to the public "next week," September 3. If true, this development only adds to the confusion and the oddity of this year&apos;s major Android software release.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to Google for more information about Android 15&apos;s rumored launch. We will update this article when we hear back.</p>

<p>Android 15 potentially launching in October isn&apos;t strange as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> debuted during that same month in 2023. What makes this odd is that we&apos;re getting everything exciting <em>around </em>this major OS without having anything actually landing. Aside from the sheer number of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-does-it-mean-if-both-google-and-samsungs-android-15-updates-are-delayed">delays from Google and Samsung</a>, the company wrapped up its Android 15 beta earlier this month.</p><p>It seemed to make sense that September would hold Android 15&apos;s launch, as suspected, but instead, we&apos;ve got the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-1-begins">first QPR beta</a> to play with. Moreover, consumers are starting to get their hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 series</a>, which was expected to launch with the stable software.</p><p>Android 14 launched early in October last year, which coincided with the release of the Pixel 8 series shortly after. Additionally, the software&apos;s QPR1 Beta 1 kicked off a couple of weeks <em>before </em>the grand reveal, which made sense as users were getting their hands on the real deal soon anyway.</p><p>We hope the delay will be worth the wait as Google seems poised to introduce <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">several new features</a> and improved software optimization.</p>

<ul><li>Users on Reddit and Google's Pixel community forum report problems with the Pixel 9 Pro XL's wireless charging.</li><li>The device is experiencing sporadic and non-functioning charging through several wireless charging accessories.</li><li>Google support confirmed to a user that the company is aware of the problem are is working on a fix.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users getting their hands on Google&apos;s Pixel 9 series report issues with its wireless charging capability.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-investigating-pixel-9-series-wireless-charging-issues/">Tech Issues Today</a>, reports in Google&apos;s Pixel community forum have ben complaining quite heavily about the Pixel 9 Pro XL (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/08/26/google-pixel-9-pro-xl-wireless-charging-issues/">9to5Google</a>). One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292671042/new-pixel-9-xl-wireless-charger-issue?hl=en">report claims</a> their device displayed "odd behavior" when wirelessly charging using a MagSafe puck with a Mous MagSafe case. The user states that their phone would begin charging, only to see it fail shortly after.</p><p>Attempting to charge via a MagSafe Qi charger caused charging to become sporadic. Moreover, the Pixel 9 Pro XL generated more heat this way, with the report adding that the device became hot. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292671042?hl=en&msgid=293113902">Another user</a> chimed into the situation, listing five wireless chargers that failed to produce consistent results.</p><p>One user attempted to charge their Pixel 9 Pro XL with Google&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-stand-2nd-gen-charger-review">second-generation stand</a>; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/292487833/pixel-9-xl-wireless-charging-issues?hl=en">that didn&apos;t help either</a>. Interestingly, they state that the device "recognizes the charging stand" but refuses to charge. They add that the device will display the appropriate charging icon on the screen, though it&apos;s not charging.</p><p>Of course, contacting Pixel support is your best option. The publication spotted a user <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1eys71k/comment/ljidk0z/">receiving confirmation</a> from Google that the device&apos;s odd wireless charging issues are being worked on. The only <em>true </em>solution is to keep a wired charger handy or try <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1eys71k/comment/ljidk0z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one of the tips</a> one user received from support.</p><p>It&apos;s worth noting that some users reported having similar charging issues with the smaller <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> as well. The number of reports is lower than the XL, but they exist, nonetheless.</p>

<p>As the Pixel 9 series arrives for consumers, issues continue to afflict yet another flagship smartphone line for the company, and it&apos;s a frustrating one at that. Pixel 8 Pro owners may remember the weird <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/im-already-doubting-the-long-term-durability-of-my-pixel-8-pro">USB-C charging port issues</a> that plagued the device a few months after it launched. Android Central reported on the topic, stating that after placing the device on the charger through the night, the phone woke up with 18%.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro faced a similar problem during its time, too.</p><p>There&apos;s no telling how long it&apos;ll take for Google to fix the issue. A fix will likely arrive via a software patch, so perhaps we can look for it in September (fingers crossed).</p><p>Google launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> on August 13 alongside the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro. The device offers a 6.8-inch display, a slightly boosted Tensor G4 SoC, and loads of Gemini features.</p>

<ul><li>Google Pixel 9a allegedly appears in leaked images for the first time.</li><li>The upcoming mid-range Google phone sports a flatter design, as seen on the Pixel 9 models.</li><li>Per the leaked images, there appears to be a newly designed camera visor on the back.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The dust around the Pixel 9 series has just settled, and a new leak hints that another Pixel 9 series phone, the mid-range Pixel 9a, is already in the works.</p><p>An X user, ShrimpApplePro, has shared what appears to be a couple of real-life images of the alleged <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a">Pixel 9a</a>. According to the user, the photos were found in a private Facebook group, which is believed to have been deleted. However, the user managed to grab the images, which show the device&apos;s design.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pixel 9aSource: some random post on Facebook pic.twitter.com/y8jwaQM6Z8<a href="https://twitter.com/VNchocoTaco/status/1827972946830520568">August 26, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The Pixel 9a will likely have the same boxy design as the recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-series-hands-on">Pixel 9</a> phones. It includes flat sides and rounded corners, which is being adopted in more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> lately, including the Samsung counterparts.</p><p>According to the images, Google&apos;s next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">mid-range phone</a> features sizeable bezels around the display. The SIM tray, USB Type-C, and a single speaker grille are placed at the bottom. The interesting element, however, appears on the back of the device.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a>, and the models before that, are widely famous for their giant camera visor at the back despite featuring only two lenses, and it also includes the LED flash. Perhaps this won&apos;t be the case this time, as the image reveals the omission of the large visor for the camera housing. Instead, the cameras are placed in a structure that&apos;s nearly flush with the back panel and offset to one side. It&apos;s quite reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/essential-phone">Essential PH-1</a> phone, at least at first glance. The LED flash is also moved out of the visor.</p><p>If the images above turn out to be accurate—unless it is some prototype Google phone—the design appears to be quite an interesting departure from the previous Pixel A series phones. It somewhat aligns with the current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a> and Pixel 9 models despite the lack of a protruding camera housing. Still, if the pricing is similar to the earlier models in the lineup and Google doesn&apos;t increase the price as it did with the Pixel 9, it might be an exciting device to choose from the budget segment.</p><p>That said, it&apos;s very possible that this isn&apos;t the Pixel 9a, and even if it is, it may not retain the same form factor, as the expected launch is quite far away. Going by the history of previous models&apos; launches, we expect the device to be launched sometime in Q2 of 2025.</p>

Pessimistic is probably too nice of a word because when looking at the rest of the market, it&apos;s abundantly clear that Samsung is no longer the market leader.</p><p>As the rumors and leaks made headlines, whatever excitement I had for the Galaxy Z Fold 6 quickly dissipated. And during <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-july-2024-biggest-announcements">Galaxy Unpacked</a>, the larger foldable seemed like an afterthought, taking a back seat to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-ring-hands-on">Galaxy Ring</a> and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on">Z Flip 6</a>.</p><p>I understand that book-style foldable phones aren&apos;t as popular, likely due to their higher prices and the fact that not everyone wants or cares about the benefits of having a mini tablet that fits in your pocket. So, while many, including my colleague <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Derrek</a>, prefer a flip phone, it&apos;s just not my cup of tea.</p><p>However, the more time that I spent using the Fold 6, the more my disappointment began to fade. Trust me, it came as more of a shock to me than I expected, especially when I looked around at the current state of the foldable phone market. That being said, while Samsung managed to change my mind in some ways, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still a mixed bag.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="5VELWyr9aGSeRw6tnDLFA6" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-2.jpg" alt="Angled view of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5VELWyr9aGSeRw6tnDLFA6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung announced the Galaxy Z Fold 6 at its Unpacked event on July 10, alongside an array of additional Galaxy devices. The phone is currently available after being released in late July 2024, with a starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB base model and maxing out at $2,259 for the 1TB version.</p><p>Additionally, there are a total of five colors to choose from: Pink, Navy, Silver Shadow, Crafted Black, and White. However, the latter two colors are only available if you purchase the Galaxy Z Fold 6 directly from Samsung&apos;s website.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-design-and-cover-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Design and Cover Screen</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-11.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/na9pUqnXoSLKUVZtihxUxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<ul><li><strong>Wider design and displays feel less cramped.</strong></li><li><strong>Noticeably lighter than its predecessors.</strong></li></ul>
<p>If I&apos;m so pessimistic, what could Samsung possibly have done to even change my mind in the slightest? Well, it actually starts with the boxier design. This move brings it more in line with what we saw with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-review">Galaxy S24 Ultra</a>, complete with the bottom left corner digging into the palm of my hand.</p><p>On paper, this design tweak brought with it a 1.05mm increase in the dimensions when closed, making for an ever-so-slightly larger cover screen. It really didn&apos;t seem like much, but I&apos;ve noticed that my hands feel less cramped when typing out messages or jotting down some notes. Really, it&apos;s not much of a difference, but it&apos;s enough to be noticeable while still falling far short of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-20.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 vs. OnePlus Open Cover Screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qQJdXgMePbYHYCiwoMaSbT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Arguably even more important is that the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is substantially lighter than its predecessor. In terms of numbers, Samsung managed to slim it down to 239 grams, a staggering drop from the 253 grams of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-review">Fold 5</a>. It&apos;s definitely noticeable, and welcome, especially when using the Fold 6 with one hand while the phone is closed.</p><p>I&apos;ve made it this far without even talking about the inner display or AI, which is more than what some companies can say. That being said, let&apos;s dive into that now, starting with the inner screen.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-hinge"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Hinge</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else Samsung changed with the design is that it&apos;s now much easier to actually unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6. There&apos;s a little bit more of a gap between the two sides of the frame. This might sound like a bad thing, but the outer border of the inner screen still closes tightly so that dust and debris don&apos;t make it through.</p><p>I discovered this, as one does, when using the Fold 6 as a fidget toy. I don&apos;t even know how I managed to do it, but I was able to slightly open the phone with just one hand. The only other book-style foldable I&apos;ve been able to do that with is the OnePlus Open.</p><p>The reason why I&apos;m pointing this out is because it&apos;s just much easier to unfold the Galaxy Z Fold 6 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-vs-galaxy-z-flip-5">compared to the Galaxy Z Fold 5</a>. The hinge feels about as perfect as one can get, even smoother than the Pixel Fold and the Open. Not to mention that I don&apos;t feel much resistance (in a good way), and the screen/hinge doesn&apos;t make discomforting noises. I&apos;m hoping the hinge will stay this way, but it&apos;s obviously too early to say with any certainty.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-inner-screen"><span>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6: Inner screen</span></h2>

<ul><li><strong>Beautiful AMOLED display.</strong></li><li><strong>The crease has improved compared to the Z Fold 5.</strong></li><li><strong>The screen is much brighter and easier to view outdoors.</strong></li></ul>
<p>With the Fold 6 open, I&apos;m now staring at a beautiful AMOLED display with a subtle crease down the middle. Seriously, Samsung does make some of the best screens. It&apos;s just a shame and quite frustrating that the company won&apos;t offer any reasons or remedies to those who <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-pwm-refresh-rate">suffer from PWM</a>. One would think that if a company is trying to reach as many people as possible, it would do something or at least give a disclaimer that the screens might affect you negatively.</p><p>Nevertheless, let&apos;s talk about that crease. If I was just going into this thing blind without having a Z Fold 5 to compare it to, I&apos;d probably say that the crease is the same with the Fold 6. That&apos;s not the case, as I do notice a slight difference between the two. It&apos;s not much, but there is a difference. However, I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s because the Fold 5 is a year old or if Samsung actually did manage to improve the crease.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-19.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 screen on in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PeqAALbhpNupheZobsjFRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Even still, there is one thing that didn&apos;t take me long to notice, as all I had to do was use the inner screen while outside. This thing gets BRIGHT. No, it&apos;s not going to blind you or anything, but it&apos;s definitely brighter than the Galaxy Z Fold 5. That&apos;s because Samsung&apos;s display now reaches a peak brightness of 2,600 nits.</p><p>This is the same peak brightness level as Samsung introduced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24</a> Ultra, surpassing the 1,750 nits found in the Galaxy Z Fold 5. The one thing that the Fold 6s main display doesn&apos;t adopt from the S24 Ultra is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-armor-galaxy-s24-ultra">anti-reflective coating</a>. It&apos;s not all that surprising since we&apos;re still working with ultra-thin glass and plastic, but I figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

<p>One of the main draws of Samsung&apos;s latest foldable phones is the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features, "Sketch to Image" being chief among them. Before going further, I invite you to enjoy a hearty laugh at my drawings. There&apos;s a reason why I take pictures and type on a keyboard for a living.</p><p>Okay, with that out of the way, I think this is arguably one of the coolest things that&apos;s possible with Galaxy AI. You can either draw something out in the Samsung Notes app or use AI to generate images. I know my "artistry" is on par with a 3rd grader, but c&apos;mon, I expected results better than what I got.</p>

<p>However, where this feature managed to impress was when making additions to pictures I&apos;ve taken. For the first one, I tried to draw a sailboat with shark fins surrounding it. So while it didn&apos;t exactly get what I was going for, the end result was much better than expected, even adding reflections in the water.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="t4LVdkp3MCoQfy7BV3JNdU" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-23.jpg" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 6 "Sketch to Image"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t4LVdkp3MCoQfy7BV3JNdU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Next up was drawing a crown on my son&apos;s head of a picture I snapped while out at a local crab house. This one turned out just about perfect, and you can&apos;t even tell that it&apos;s AI-generated, except for the watermark in the bottom left corner. There&apos;s no way to avoid this, even when using Samsung&apos;s built-in wallpaper generator.</p><p>One of the problems here, at least with Sketch to Image, is that it&apos;s really just a parlor trick, albeit an impressive one. After spending some time with Pixel Studio on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">new Pixel 9 phones</a>, I realized that sometimes it&apos;s better to type out what you want to see, as opposed to trying to draw it. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, that&apos;s not currently an option with Galaxy AI, which is a bit disappointing. Frankly, I didn&apos;t even know this was an option I would want until I was messing around with Pixel Studio. But now that I know it&apos;s possible, I hope to see Samsung adopt it in a future software update.</p><p>So, using Galaxy AI to add things to your pictures can be pretty fun. But what about removing items or people from those pictures? In my time using the Fold 6, it&apos;s been pretty hit or miss.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="B58xp2njNAv2BB8WXpU46i" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-camera-sample_21.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Camera Samples" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/B58xp2njNAv2BB8WXpU46i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1875" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When I went to Alexandria to take some pictures with the Fold 6 on a beautiful and clear day, I stumbled upon the "<em>Providence</em>." It&apos;s a "reproduction of the first ship authorized to serve in the Continental Navy," which for someone who&apos;s a bit of a history buff, is pretty darn awesome. </p><p>Although I didn&apos;t jump on for a tour, I did walk around until the next tour got underway so I could try and snap a few pics from the shoreline walkway. However, there were a few smaller boats that were following behind the <em>Providence</em><em><strong> </strong></em>but that doesn&apos;t really make for a great picture.</p>

<p>So, I tried using the object removal tool built into Samsung&apos;s Gallery app to get rid of the smaller boats. It worked fine with the boat right behind the <em>Providence</em>, but no matter what I tried, I could not get rid of the other boat further back. Pinch-to-zoom, circling the boat, drawing over the top of it—nothing.</p><p>Then, I switched over to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos</a> app, pulled up the same picture, and in a few seconds, it was gone. On the one hand, it&apos;s great being able to use Galaxy AI and Photos in tandem to make edits. But at that point, why would I even bother trying to use the native photo editing when Google Photos is going to do a better job anyway?</p>

<p>Samsung makes the most performant and powerful Android phone on the market. Rinse and repeat for every flagship Galaxy phone, and it continues to ring true with the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Honestly, I could probably just call it here, as we know what the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> for Galaxy can do by now.</p><p>Much like the cameras, the rest of the internals remain the same, meaning we have 12GB of RAM, up to 1TB of storage, and a 4,400mAh battery. Although it doesn&apos;t really affect the performance, Samsung is falling a bit behind as the likes of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-apex-edition-review">OnePlus Open</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Fold Pro</a> have upped the RAM to 16GB. </p><p>It would&apos;ve made sense for Samsung to do the same, even if it might seem like overkill. With seven years of promised updates, there&apos;s a pretty good chance that having additional RAM would pay dividends. Only time will tell if that&apos;s the case, but I can&apos;t help but feel like the Fold 6 is at a disadvantage in the long term. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW" name="multi-window-galaxy-z-fold-6.jpg" alt="Multi-window apps on the Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTujuYbNTt6cGH2zAMrzxW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Something else that shouldn&apos;t come as a surprise is that even with all of the extra software features, the Fold 6 doesn&apos;t skip a beat. While it&apos;s easy to point out how the competition is leaving Samsung in the rear-view mirror, the reality is that I still much prefer the flexibility and versatility offered by One UI. </p><p>While Open Canvas on the OnePlus Open is arguably more intuitive for multitasking, it just doesn&apos;t really <em>work</em> the way my brain does. I much prefer the way that Samsung implements multitasking via split screens, floating windows, and the option to "force" apps to take advantage, even if the developers haven&apos;t implemented the appropriate APIs.</p><p>And if the "out-of-the-box" experience isn&apos;t enough, you always have Good Lock to take things up a couple of notches. Whether you&apos;re simply using your favorite icon pack or setting up a bunch of Bixby Routines, Samsung really does offer a "do it all" experience.</p>

<ul><li><strong>"Same" camera hardware falls behind the pack.</strong></li><li><strong>Images are good in perfect conditions.</strong></li><li>Struggles with zoom and moving subjects.</li></ul>
<p>If there&apos;s one thing that I&apos;ve been screaming from the rooftops for the past couple of years, it&apos;s that we deserve flagship cameras on foldable phones. I was really hoping that the Fold 6 would <em>finally </em>be the catalyst for change, but alas, it wasn&apos;t meant to be. Samsung opted to rely on the same hardware it introduced three years ago with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-spent-a-week-with-the-z-fold-5-coming-home">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. </p><p>It&apos;s not so much that you can&apos;t still get great pictures out of the Fold 6 because you definitely can. Instead, it&apos;s more of the fact that we <em>know</em> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a> can be equipped with cameras capable of rivaling slab phones. Don&apos;t believe me? Just look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x-fold3-pro-review">Vivo X Fold 3 Pro</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-and-magic-vs3-foldables-announced">Honor Magic V3</a>. </p>

<p>I&apos;m not really sure what Samsung is doing here, besides deciding to rely purely on image processing to try and offset the outdated hardware. But when you pay $1,800 for a phone, you expect it to be at the top of the class, and that&apos;s just not the case with the Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>With my mini-rant out of the way, I found the same thing that I usually find when using cameras on Samsung foldable phones — they&apos;re good, or even great, as long as the conditions are perfect. As soon as a wrench gets thrown, you&apos;re at the mercy of steady hands and steady subjects. </p>

<p>A good example of this is when I tried to take pictures of my six-month-old son. He&apos;s a wiggle worm in the truest sense, constantly moving around and reaching for something. Needless to say, it&apos;s almost like he&apos;s unintentionally providing the "ultimate camera stress test." </p><p>In one instance, he had woken up from a nap, and I walked down the hallway to get him up. Seeing as he recently learned to sit up on his own, I was greeted with this adorable and goofy face looking at me before I even made it into his room. I did what most people would do: I grabbed the Fold 6 and tried to snap a quick picture. </p><p>For some additional context, the hallway was dark, and I was still about 20-25 feet away from him, as I didn&apos;t want him to move too much if I were to actually go into the room. Instead, I just pinched to try and zoom in and get a closer look from afar.</p><p>However, I couldn&apos;t have been more disappointed in the results. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1875px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="8ePnoMiCf6DNYBvQoNuYDe" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-camera-sample_1.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 Camera Samples" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ePnoMiCf6DNYBvQoNuYDe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1875" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Not only was he no longer looking at me by the time the picture was captured, but he was almost unrecognizable. The amount of processing done to the picture has basically ruined it completely, which, in turn, ruins a moment that I&apos;ll never have back. Sure, the same scenario will probably play out again, but I know that if the Fold 6 is the phone in my pocket, I&apos;m better off just taking a mental snapshot and going to get him out of the crib. </p><p>Were the conditions perfect? Nope. And that&apos;s my point about these cameras. If I had my iPhone or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Pixel 8 Pro</a> in my pocket instead, that picture would <em>probably</em> turn out a lot better. I can&apos;t say with any certainty that would be the case, because it&apos;s not like I could put life on pause for a split-second so I could grab another phone. </p><p>So, instead of having a hilarious picture to send to family and friends, I have a blurry mess that looks more AI-generated than what I get when I use Sketch to Image.</p>

<p>Gone are the days when Samsung and its Galaxy Z Fold was the only game in town. In terms of book-style foldable phones, Samsung&apos;s stiffest competition comes from OnePlus and Google. The former burst onto the scene in late 2023 with the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open">OnePlus Open</a>, which is essentially the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-and-n3-flip-global-launch">Oppo Find N3</a> with OnePlus branding. </p><p>Meanwhile, Google has the Pixel Fold, which comes with its own list of benefits and pitfalls. However, that shouldn&apos;t be the case for too much longer as Google announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-2">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>. However, we&apos;ll have to wait and see how the phone performs and whether it arrives as a truly viable alternative.  </p><p>That&apos;s pretty much all we have if looking at Samsung&apos;s competition domestically. The story dramatically shifts when considering global markets as Honor, Vivo, and others have caught up and surpassed Samsung&apos;s offerings. Notably, Xiaomi recently unveiled the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-announces-mix-flip-and-mix-fold-4">Mix Fold 4</a>, with an initial launch in China ahead of a global launch at a later date. </p>

<p>It&apos;s still difficult to decide whether to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 6. Outside of the OnePlus Open and Pixel Fold 9 Pro, there are not many easily accessible alternatives in the U.S. </p><p>With the former, you won&apos;t be able to walk into a carrier store and pick one up, and even with trade-in deals, that&apos;s a tough pill to swallow. However, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold already looks to be quite an impressive second showing for Google, but you can&apos;t buy it just yet.</p><p>It&apos;s not like I hate the Galaxy Z Fold 6; it&apos;s just that I wish that Samsung would be an innovator in the space instead of just sitting back and counting its cash. Yes, the design is a surprising improvement over the Fold 5, and the performance is still top-notch. But it just kind of sucks to see the smallest of updates arrive for a phone that costs $1,800 from a company that has the potential for so much more.</p><p>All of that being said, until we can spend some quality time with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 is still the best foldable for the majority of people. </p>

<p><em><strong>Anonymous asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Why do we need to put our phones in airplane mode when traveling by plane? Can a phone really affect the electronics in an airplane?</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Thanks</strong></em></p>
<p>I love questions like this. Not only is there a bit of a technical issue involved, but it&apos;s one of those things that seems like a relic of the past. To top it off, there&apos;s no cut-and-dried answer.</p><p>In case you&apos;re here just looking for a quick answer, I like to give it up front: There are two reasons why the captain or flight crew tells us to use airplane mode. It <em>could</em> electronically interfere with the plane and it forces us to pay attention during take-off and landing.</p>
<p><strong>A quick reminder of what airplane mode means:</strong> It is a setting on your phone that disables all radio frequency communication in and out of it. You can usually go back in and enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth once it&apos;s activated, but enabling it will kill any signal to and from your phone. It exists as a quick way to turn everything off at once like you&apos;re asked to do on an airplane.</p>
<p>Now, some more about why we still need to do this. Notice I used the word "could" in the short answer above. Nobody is saying that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">your phone</a> <em>will</em> mess with the electronics on a plane, but <em>there is a chance</em>. While the FAA doesn&apos;t have any case data showing that cellular use has caused a problem, there is a chance.</p><p>There&apos;s actually a chance of it happening with two specific things: the headsets pilots use to communicate with each other and the plane&apos;s altimeter. Again, it isn&apos;t likely that there will be a problem and no data is saying it has ever been one, but the radio frequency of some signals overlaps with these two systems.</p>
<p>If you can remember back when we had cordless landline phones, you might also remember seeing them mess with broadcast television or even hearing truck drivers talk on the C.B. radio through them. That&apos;s because the frequencies used are very close to each other, and one signal can be strong enough to bleed over. It&apos;s funny hearing the phone make the TV crackle and beep. It&apos;s not so funny if you trying to call your friend messes with the pilot trying to talk to the copilot or a flight attendant.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7" name="airplane-mode.jpg" alt="Airplane mode toggle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ckMANBhLbAu8deVSnvKmb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-does-5g-pose-threat-airline-industry">Interference with aircraft altimeters</a> is another possibly real issue that&apos;s already caused problems — not for aircraft, but for Verizon and AT&T.</p><p>Without getting too nerdy, I&apos;ll explain. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/c-band-and-mid-band-5g-what-it-and-why-its-important-your-next-phone">C band spectrum</a> in the 3.7 to 3.98GHz range was auctioned off to phone carriers for use with 5G networks. Aircraft altimeters operate in the 4.2 to 4.4GHz range. AT&T and Verizon famously had to halt plans to roll out part of their 5G network in places close to airports because these signals are close enough to bleed into each other. An airplane needs to know how high above the ground it is, and some 5G cell towers could interfere.</p>
<p>If you&apos;re flying low enough that your phone tries to connect using these frequencies, there&apos;s a chance this could cause interference.</p><p>One thing all of this has in common is that it&apos;s based on the idea that it could happen, not that it will. When a tin can filled with people is up in the air, anything that has a possibility of making it fall out of the sky is a problem. A pilot and the airlines won&apos;t take chances and tell you to turn your phone off. If you don&apos;t listen, there may be consequences, too. It sounds silly, but it is what it is.</p>
<p>One last thing — having you turn your phone off means you&apos;re not trying to text your friend or boss while the plane is on the runway. Aircraft personnel want you to pay extra attention during take-off and landing, so <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-digital-wellbeing">pulling your head out of your phone</a> for a few minutes is one way to help make it happen.</p>

The Google Pixel 9 and the Google Pixel 9 Pro are similar in many ways, including their overall size and dimensions. This means that cases designed for one will fit the other, and vice versa. So, if you decide on the Pixel 9 and later want to upgrade, or you bought a case for one and then decided on getting the other, you don’t need to worry as it will fit.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="what-is-difference-between-the-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-2">What is difference between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro?</h2>
<p>The Google Pixel 9 and Google Pixel 9 Pro are two of four new phones Google announced at its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/made-by-google-2024-biggest-announcements">Made by Google event</a> in August 2024, joined by the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/should-you-upgrade-to-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> as well. The two phones, as noted, are identical in look, size, and dimensions. They also offer virtually the same features and specs but for a few minor differences. Naturally, the Pixel 9 Pro is a slight step up from the entry-level Pixel 9.</p><p>When looking at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Google Pixel 9 vs. Pixel 9 Pro</a>, the latter has a much higher resolution and brighter screen, but both are 6.3 inches in size. The Pixel 9’s screen boasts 2,424 x 1,080 pixel resolution and the Pixel 9 Pro offers 2,856 x 1,280 pixel resolution. The latter is also a Super Actua LTPO OLED versus an Actua OLED. The Pixel 9 delivers up to 1,800 nits of brightness in HDR and 2,700 nits of peak brightness and the Pixel 9 Pro 2,000 nits of brightness in HDR and 3,000 nits of peak brightness. </p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro’s front camera is better at 42MP versus just 10.5MP in the Pixel 9 and the phone adds a 48MP Quad PD telephoto lens as well. There’s also an option for Super Res Zoom up to 30x with the main 50MP camera of the Pixel 9 Pro so you can get even better close-up shots from far away. </p><p>Additionally, the Google Pixel 9 Pro is equipped with more RAM at 16GB versus 12GB and there’s an option to get up to 1TB storage whereas the Pixel 9 taps out at just 256GB. This is useful for power users since neither phone has a microSD slot for expandable storage. </p><p>In terms of dimensions, both phones measure identical 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 inches, with the Pixel 9 weighing a single gram more at 198 grams versus 199 grams for the Pixel 9 Pro. But the weight has no bearing on how the cases fit. The cameras and side buttons are also identically placed, making swapping cases a cinch. </p><p>Bottom line: when it comes to protecting the Google Pixel 9 or Google Pixel 9 Pro with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-google-pixel-9-and-pixel-9-pro-cases">the best cases</a>, they are interchangeable. One will fit the other. This opens the door to plenty of options, with many cases already available for the new devices. While both these phones are relatively affordable, you’ll still want to protect your investment right away with a solid and fashionable case.

The bigger and brighter displays, new AI features, and the slimmer and lighter design, all make for an excellent foldable experience. It's still pricey, but at least it now looks the part. </p></p>

<p>Samsung didn't mess around with its formula for the Fold 6 too much, and that's starting to become a problem. It's a fantastic flagship foldable in every sense, and the slimmer and lighter design is certainly welcomed. Compatibility with the S Pen still gives it an edge over the competition. </p></p>

<p>The new Pixel 9 lineup is Google&apos;s strongest and most aggressive hardware launch yet. But what&apos;s even more impressive is its latest foldable called the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Rather than calling it the Pixel Fold 2, Google is clubbing it with the rest of the new series, and that makes sense since it shares a lot of the features and hardware with the Pixel 9 phones. The new 9 Pro Fold has a major design overhaul and, to our surprise, comes at the same starting price as last year&apos;s model. </p><p>In the U.S., its biggest rival is going to be the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, which has pretty much gone unchallenged in its segment and is one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">best foldable phones</a> in the market. Newer offerings like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> have given it good competition, but we think the new Pixel 9 Pro Fold will be its biggest opponent. With similar flagship hardware and a ton of AI software features, we pit the Google Pixel 9 Pro vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 to see if we have a definitive winner and which phone you should buy next. </p>

<p>The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> looks nothing like the Pixel Fold from last year, and that&apos;s a good thing. The design is arguably much better; the new matte glass and aluminum finishes feel richer, and the ugly thick bezels inside the folding display are all gone. It looks like it&apos;s part of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9 family</a>. You get the same wide aspect ratio that we loved from the first model, but the chassis is now slimmer and lighter. It measures 10.5mm in depth when folded and just 5.1mm when unfolded. It&apos;s not the world&apos;s slimmest, but I&apos;ll take it. </p><p>The weight has also been reduced significantly, down to 257g. The phone comes in Obsidian and Porcelain colors. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-waterproof">The 9 Pro Fold is still IPX8-rated</a> for water resistance. One major annoyance we faced with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-fold-review">Pixel Fold</a> was that it never quite unfolded completely flat, but Google has fixed that with the new model. </p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> looks more or less the same as the previous two generations, although it has a slightly wider aspect ratio this time. It&apos;s only just about noticeable if you&apos;re coming from an older Fold phone, but it&apos;s not enough to make the typing experience on the cover screen much better. Samsung, too, uses aluminum and glass for the construction, and the Fold 6 is lighter than the Pixel at 239g. It&apos;s still slightly thicker, though, at 12.1mm and 5.6mm in its folded and unfolded state, respectively. </p><p>Samsung offers way more colors, as the Galaxy Z Fold 6 comes in Silver, Shadow, Pink, and Navy. Crafted Black and White are two exclusive shades if you buy them via Samsung.com. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/is-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-waterproof">The Fold 6 is now IP48-rated</a> for "dust" and water resistance, but keep in mind that the dust resistance only protects it from solid particles larger than 1mm, which doesn&apos;t qualify as dust. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold gets new displays on the outside and inside. The outer display is a larger 6.3-inch Actua display with a 20:9 aspect ratio, similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. It&apos;s an OLED with a Full HD+ resolution, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/corning-gorilla-glass-victus-2">Gorilla Glass Victus 2</a> protection, and a variable refresh rate of 60Hz-120Hz. Google claims it can get as bright as up to 1,800 nits for HDR content and up to 2,700 nits of peak brightness. </p><p>The folding screen is larger too, at 8 inches. Google calls it a Super Actua Flex display. This OLED panel has a 2,076x2,152 resolution, UTG glass, and LTPO tech which can vary the refresh rate from 1Hz  to 120Hz. It has the same peak brightness as the outer screen, but HDR brightness is up to 1,600 nits. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.68%;"><img id="SUSdRsJouf4mDS6WQbmqFn" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-4.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in Flex Mode" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SUSdRsJouf4mDS6WQbmqFn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1667" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung brought some minor refinements to the display on the Fold 6, but not any major changes. The corners of the folding display are no longer curved, which is the opposite of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It&apos;s a 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X panel, features LTPO tech, and has a 2,160x1,856 resolution. Peak brightness is similar at 2,600 nits. </p><p>The outer display is a 6.3-inch AMOLED panel, but it&apos;s taller with a narrower 22.1:9 aspect ratio than the Pixel. It too has LTPO tech with a 1Hz to 120Hz refresh rate and the same peak brightness. The slimmer profile makes it easier to slip into narrower pockets, but the 9 Pro Fold still trumps the Galaxy when it comes to ease of using the outer screen, espeically when typing. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 for the base model with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Unlike some countries like India, which will only get one variant, the U.S. and the rest of the world will get a 512GB option, too, with the same amount of RAM. I like that Google increased the RAM on the new Fold, as all those AI and multitasking features should benefit from it in the long run. The 9 Pro Fold is powered by the Tensor G4 SoC, which claims to be quicker and more efficient in general and AI processing. Other hardware features include Google&apos;s Titan M2 security chip, fingerprint sensor, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/wi-fi-7-explained">Wi-Fi 7</a>, Bluetooth 5.3, and dual-band GPS. </p><p>The camera sensors have also received minor updates. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s rear cameras include a 48MP wide with an f/1.7 aperture, a new 10.5MP ultrawide with a wider 127-degree field of view and autofocus for macro shots, and a 10.8MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom and up to 20x Super Res Zoom. The back also features a laser autofocus system and spectral and flicker sensors. </p><p>The camera on the cover display and in the folding display is the same 10MP sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. The 9 Pro Fold can shoot up to 4K 60fps videos, along with 10-bit HDR videos from the rear camera and Night Sight video. </p><p>The Pixel 9 Pro Fold&apos;s battery is smaller than its predecessor&apos;s, but it&apos;s still larger than the Fold 6. The 4,650mAh capacity can be quickly charged using Google&apos;s certified 45W optional charger. </p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 starts at $1,899 for 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and goes up to $2,259 for the 1TB variant. It&apos;s powered by the Qualcomm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-3">Snapdragon 8 Gen 3</a> SoC, which is still the flagship chip in 2024. It&apos;ll be interesting to see how this compares to the new Tensor chip in the Pixel. Like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, the Fold 6 also gets Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.3, Ultra-Wideband support, and USB 3.2. The Galaxy has the unique advantage of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-the-s-pen">supporting Samsung&apos;s S Pen stylus</a>, which is a handy tool for jotting notes or sketching out ideas. </p><p>The cameras on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 are quite versatile and good enough for everyday use, although we would have liked to see a bigger upgrade by now. The rear of the Fold 6 gets a 50MP main, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultrawide. The cover screen has a 10MP sensor, while the folding screen uses the same 4MP under-display camera. The latter has improved since it was first introduced, but it&apos;s no match for the quality of a high-resolution sensor. </p><p>Battery life on the Fold series has generally been good, and the Galaxy Z Fold 6 features a 4,400mAh battery. A day&apos;s worth of usage is something you can typically expect from this phone. Sadly, wired charging is still only 25W, and you&apos;ll need to get your own charger. Wireless charging is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/does-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-support-wireless-charging">supported at 15W</a>. </p>

<p>The Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold ships with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and is slated to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-google-pixel-9-pro-fold-get">seven years of software updates and security patches</a>. You also get <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> baked in from the moment you set it up, which can do much more than Assitant, like generate stories for your blog, draft, and email, or help you know more about what&apos;s on your screen. Fold users will also get a one-year free subscription to Gemini Advanced via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a>, which includes 2TB of cloud storage and the ability to use Gemini in Gmail and Docs. </p><p>Google is also adding new AI features, which will be exclusive to Pixel devices. Pixel Screenshots uses Gemini Nano to remember all the details from screenshots taken on your Pixel phone, so you can simply prompt it to find what you&apos;re looking for later instead of having to dig through your pile of screenshots. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/pixel-9-add-me-feature-is-quintessentially-google">Add Me</a> feature for the camera app lets you add yourself to group shots if you&apos;re the one taking it by merging two photos of one with you in it and one without. Google has beefed up its multitasking capabilities, too, with Split Screen and the ability to save app pairs. You also get a taskbar with recent apps that can be pinned for quick access.</p>

<p>Samsung has now almost perfected its multitasking features for its Fold series. It allows you to open three apps at once and more in floating windows. Folding the Z Fold 6 halfway automatically rearranges the layout in some apps to offer extended functionality. There are also a ton of Galaxy AI features to play with, the most interesting one being the "Sketch to Image" feature. This lets you generate life-like images of objects and animals by simply doodling over an existing image. There are plenty more <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> features like live translate, as well as Google AI features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-circle-to-search">Circle to Search</a> and much more.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 6 ships with Samsung&apos;s One UI skin, which is based on Android 14. Like the Pixel, it gets <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-receive">seven years of OS and security updates</a>.

<p>If I were to choose between the Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold or the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6, the choice would be pretty easy — I&apos;d go with the Pixel. There are a couple of good reasons, too. The main one would have to be the form factor. The wider aspect ratio of the Pixel 9 Pro Fold makes it feel like a regular phone when folded, so it&apos;s easier to use, type on, and play games on it, too. Next would have to be the design. It looks more modern compared to the Fold 6, which, by now, can be mistaken for even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>. Then there are those cool, exclusive Pixel AI features like Add Me, which can be extremely useful. On top of that, you can expect great things from the cameras, and you&apos;ll always be among the first to get the latest Android software. </p><p>Now that the 9 Pro Fold is here, we could see a price shuffle for the Galaxy Z Fold 6. It&apos;s still a good option for anyone looking for excellent stylus support, great gaming performance, and desktop-like computing with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-samsung-dex">Samsung DeX</a>. </p>
