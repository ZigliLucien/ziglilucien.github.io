                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Chipolo finally updated its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-bluetooth-trackers#section-best-overall">Bluetooth trackers</a> to work with the new Google Find My Device network. Dubbed the Chipolo POP series, the products launched on April 14, 2025. The good news is that the brand's trackers are ubiquitously compatible with both Google and Apple's networks, making them excellent for most households.</p><p>POP trackers have improved specs compared to the last-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/chipolo-one-bluetooth-tracker-review">Chipolo trackers that I reviewed</a> previously. At $29 apiece, the pricing is just a tad higher, but it's only a dollar or two more so it's acceptable.</p><p>You get decent upgrades for such a small price hike, such as an improved 300ft Bluetooth range and a more robust IP55 water and dust-resistant rating. There's a new remote selfie feature that enables users to snap pictures on their phone from a distance by clicking the POP button.</p><p>The Chipolo POP retains 120 decibels of max loudness and a one-year-long battery that's easily replaceable. And of course, as is customary, Chipolo's POP trackers come in bright colors such as yellow, blue, green, and red in addition to staples like black and white.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="EpZxG5Jvf8KSoXJLmRzLQj" name="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" alt="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EpZxG5Jvf8KSoXJLmRzLQj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="844" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>All the best names in the Bluetooth tracker biz updated their lineups following the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/googles-find-my-device-network-is-live-but-it-isnt-working-as-expected">relaunch of the Google Find My Device</a> network in June 2024. Even Motorola threw its hat in the ring, releasing a stylish and colorful accessory called the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/motorola-moto-tag-hands-on-review">Moto Tag</a>.</p><p>Most trackers only work with a single tracking ecosystem. For example, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/new-tile-2024-lineup-life360-app">new Tile by Life360</a> trackers from 2024 only work with Life360's network. Despite the fact that it supports iOS devices, the Moto Tag is only compatible with Google Find My Device.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/pebblebee-announces-google-find-my-device-compatible-trackers">Pebblebee's refreshed tracker lineup</a> from 2024 supports both Google and Apple's networks, but users can only register their tracker with either one regardless, limiting the potential trackability.</p><p>Like Pebblebee, Chipolo took the same route with the POP tracker. Sure, it's compatible with both Apple and Google's Find My Device networks, but you're forced to choose either one instead of using them together.</p><p>Users aren't looking to play a trivial game of "this or that" when buying trackers; they just want to find lost stuff as efficiently as possible.</p>
<h2 id="a-google-and-apple-alliance-needs-to-happen-2">A Google and Apple alliance needs to happen</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1489px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="pRbtXSHwoW7tqK8fjANASj" name="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" alt="Chipolo POP Bluetooth tracker" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRbtXSHwoW7tqK8fjANASj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1489" height="838" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chipolo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is a major drawback for Google. Back when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/testing-new-google-find-my-device-trackers">I tested the Google's Find My Device network</a> with the latest trackers, and I was left severely disappointed. The network just doesn't function as well as Apple's network, so it's likely that most folks will end up opting for Apple's network instead.</p><p>Although <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/google-responds-find-my-device-criticism">Google has since put in more effort</a> to improve the usability and functionality of its network, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-find-my-device-network-rolls-out">adding handy features</a> such as offline tracking, shared items, and third-party compatibility, the cold hard truth is that it still falls short.</p><p>Even if we now have new trackers that can work on both networks (but not simultaneously), most users will probably end up using the Apple network simply because it's more reliable. It's either having to choose between Apple and Google, or the alternative Tile by Life360 network which has a web of millions of devices to rely on for findability.</p><p>In a world where Bluetooth multipoint is commonplace and we're moving towards the next <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">evolution of Bluetooth called Auracast</a>, I can't comprehend why Bluetooth trackers are limited in this way, especially when considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-google-find-my-device-network-works-why-you-should-care">how Google's new Find My Device network actually works</a>.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Why are companies not making trackers that function on both Google AND Apple's networks?</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Why are companies not making trackers that function on both Google <strong>AND</strong> Apple's networks? Both brands would benefit from such an alliance and so would the users. they've already <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/unwanted-tracking-notifications-rolling-out-ios-android">partnered up to create the Detecting Unwanted Location Trackers</a> spec makes it possible to deliver unknown tracking notifications to both iOS and Android users. I imagine enabling cross-functionality between the two networks would be an extension of this.</p><p>This is not talked about enough, even though this could be highly beneficial to consumers. So I'm asking Google, Apple, and Bluetooth tracker brands, on behalf of the world. Please make a tracker that can leverage both Google and Apple's Find My Device networks at the same time.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Most users of technology don't have to consciously think about security vulnerabilities on their most-used devices, including Android-based products, very often. As long as you update your phone as soon as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-play-services-april-auto-reboot-security-changelog">new security patches are available</a>, you're usually covered. However, there's an intricate government-supported program operating to make that all possible, and it almost went dark today.</p><p>After roughly 24 hours of uncertainty, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) announced that it would continue funding the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) on the day its previous contract was set to expire. Today, April 16, a spokesperson for the CISA told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/649835/cve-cybersecurity-program-contract-renewed" target="_blank">The Verge</a> that the agency "executed the option period on the contract to ensure there will be no lapse in critical CVE services."</p><p>But it went down to the wire in a move that could've sent the entire globe into a tech security nightmare.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="T2CdpCDsKhZumT2g6thqKF" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-november-update" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 showing "Your watch is up to date" with the November 5 security patch, next to a Pixel 9a showing the current date (April 10)." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/T2CdpCDsKhZumT2g6thqKF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It all has to do with the CVE program, which identifies and tracks security issues in public view, from the point a potential problem is identified to the time when a proper fix is issued. It has nearly 500 partners that include security researchers, open-source developers, and major companies — including big ones like Google, Microsoft, and Apple.</p><p>If the CVE program sounds familiar, that's probably because you've seen a CVE code mentioned in an article (like one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-zero-day-exploit-february-2024-detailed">many CVE-related ones on Android Central</a>) or the release notes of an update. They're also a major part of monthly releases on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-security-everything-you-need-to-know">Android Security Bulletin</a>. These codes, like <strong>CVE-2024-53104</strong>, start with CVE followed by the year and a number, and create a universal database to track security flaws across devices, platforms, and companies.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1368px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:113.60%;"><img id="cDVtY3oPJdwCNjuNhjZ6aE" name="Android-Security-Bulletin-April-2025" alt="A screenshot of the latest Android Security Bulletin with CVE codes." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cDVtY3oPJdwCNjuNhjZ6aE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1368" height="1554" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A screenshot of the latest Android Security Bulletin with CVE codes.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future / Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CVE program has been active for 25 years, beginning in 1999. It has become invaluable to the security community, serving as a universal way for researchers, developers, companies, and the public to work together to discover and patch crucial vulnerabilities. More importantly, it publicly states whether a vulnerability is believed to have been actively exploited by bad actors.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="8zGfJm3MX3uZ4iJo3AP9TK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-5" alt="Android 15 logo on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zGfJm3MX3uZ4iJo3AP9TK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Leading security researchers have pointed out the consequences of the CVE program shutting down, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/lukOlejnik">Lukasz Olejnik on X (formerly Twitter).</a></p><p>"The consequence will be a breakdown in coordination between vendors, analysts, and defense systems — no one will be certain they are referring to the same vulnerability," wrote Olejnik, a scholar with advanced degrees in computer science and information technology law with specializations in privacy. "Total chaos, and a sudden weakening of cybersecurity across the board."</p>
<h2 id="the-crisis-has-been-avoided-for-now-2">The crisis has been avoided... for now?</h2>
<p>Luckily, it appears that the crisis has been avoided, as the federal government will continue to fund the CVE program for at least the near future. However, the decision coming down to the wire as the Trump administration slashes federal funding across the board puts the CVE program in a more uncertain position now than at any point in its 25-year history.</p><p>"The CVE Program is invaluable to the cyber community and a priority of CISA," the spokesperson said in a statement to The Verge. "We appreciate our partners’ and stakeholders’ patience."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="wQ5kQ7Tz2Q38S3qddmfDT4" name="android-15-23.jpg" alt="Android 15 Easter egg on Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 9, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wQ5kQ7Tz2Q38S3qddmfDT4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But that final green light didn't come quick enough, as the security world already started making plans to keep the CVE program up and running — even without federal funding. CVE board members created the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org" target="_blank">CVE Foundation</a>, a nonprofit planned for in secret for the past year that would ensure the CVE mission continues.</p><p>"CVE, as a cornerstone of the global cybersecurity ecosystem, is too important to be vulnerable itself," said Kent Landfield, an officer of the CVE Foundation, in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org" target="_blank">press release</a>. "Cybersecurity professionals around the globe rely on CVE identifiers and data as part of their daily work, from security tools and advisories to threat intelligence and response. Without CVE, defenders are at a massive disadvantage against global cyber threats."</p><p>The foundation explains that it is concerned that having a single government sponsor could create "a single point of failure in the vulnerability management ecosystem."</p>
<h2 id="the-cve-program-could-be-changing-as-we-know-it-2">The CVE program could be changing as we know it</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="xUHSDHLtrfvvsGRZu6dnoH" name="Android-16-logo-orange-oneplus-13-03" alt="An orange and blue Android 16 logo on a OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xUHSDHLtrfvvsGRZu6dnoH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The CVE program is a critical part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-rolls-out-april-2025-update-for-galaxy-s25-series">Android security</a>, and it should be relevant to every single person who touches an Android-based device. Although government funding has been acquired for now, the moves that have been set in motion by the last-minute decision may not be reversed. The CVE Foundation is here, and it might be here to stay.</p><p>There's no word on whether the CVE Foundation will continue to operate now that the CVE program has retained U.S. government funding, but the foundation said more information will be released "over the coming days." The immediate U.S. government funding doesn't solve the long-term problem the CVE Foundation has identified — the possibility of having a single point of failure — so there still may be a reason for it to exist.</p><p>Regardless of how this all plays out, the decision to fund the CVE program should've never come this close to ending a crucial global security program. Most of us have the luxury to not think about device security that often, and it's programs like the CVE that allow us that privilege.</p>

<hr>
<p>While other online gaming storefronts allowed Android users to buy games from their smartphones, like Steam, this feature was notably absent from the Xbox app. Now, that's finally changing. In the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/" target="_blank">Xbox April Update</a>, the platform added support for buying games, purchasing add-ons, subscribing to Game Pass, and redeem Perks straight from an iOS Android device.</p><p>The expanded functionality is set to become available for beta testers on both Android and iOS first, with all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store">Google Play Store users</a> and App Store users getting the feature at a later date. For users that have payment information saved with Xbox, it'll only take two clicks on their Android phone to buy a new game. This streamlines the browsing and purchasing process, which can be difficult on an Xbox due to controller limitations.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, it should: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/xbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling">Xbox announced plans to support this feature</a> way back in October 2024. It resulted from a U.S. court decision that barred Google from mandating developers use Google Play Billing to process in-app purchases. But due to court delays, Microsoft had to put its plans on pause until things could be sorted out.</p>

<p>Buying Xbox games from the Android mobile app is now possible due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-legal-setback-could-open-the-door-for-more-app-stores-on-android">requirement for developers to use Google Play Billing</a> being dropped. With Google Play Billing, Xbox would've had to surrender a cut to Google for processing payments through the Play Store.</p><p>At the time, Xbox President Sarah Bond stated that these changes would make it possible for the company to offer Xbox purchases within the Android app. "The court's ruling to open up Google's mobile store in the US will allow more choice and flexibility," said Bond in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/BondSarah_Bond/status/1844506029599707255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1844506029599707255%7Ctwgr%5E93c301d746ffdbe8e1ae9e448297bc277d6e4097%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.androidcentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fandroid-games%2Fxbox-app-to-allow-purchases-gaming-following-google-court-ruling" target="_blank">October 2024 post</a>.</p><p>Aside from purchasing games and add-ons in the Xbox app, users can also remotely install those games on their Xbox console. So, users can buy an app on their Android phone and have it installed and ready to go by the time they return home.</p><p>Separately, Xbox is removing Remote Play support from the Android app, but it will still remain accessible on mobile through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xbox.com/remoteplay">xbox.com/remoteplay</a> website<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://xbox.com/remoteplay">.</a></p>

<ul><li>Fitbit watches are soon losing support for Google Assistant.</li><li>Google announced that Assistant would be phased out on Fitbit watches in the coming weeks in a community post last month.</li><li>Fitbit owners can still use Amazon Alexa as a voice assistant in supported regions.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Some Fitbit smartwatches support using a voice assistant like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-assistant">Google Assistant</a> or Amazon Alexa, but Google is currently phasing out Assistant support. Owners of the Fitbit Sense, Fitbit Sense 2, Fitbit Versa 2, Fitbit Versa 3, and Fitbit Versa 4 will soon discover that Google Assistant is no longer available, if it hasn't disappeared already.</p><p>The phaseout was officially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Google-Assistant-will-no-longer-be-available-on-Fitbit-Sense-and-Versa-3/td-p/5735504" target="_blank">announced</a> last month, and email notices are being sent out to affected Fitbit users.</p><p>"Over the next few weeks we will be progressively phasing out Google Assistant on your Fitbit device," a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://community.fitbit.com/t5/Sense/Google-Assistant-will-no-longer-be-available-on-Fitbit-Sense-and-Versa-3/td-p/5735504" target="_blank">community post</a> explains. "This change means that Google Assistant voice control for activities will soon no longer be available on your Fitbit device."</p><p>Fitbit users of these devices can still use Amazon Alexa as their voice assistant in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/fitbit/answer/14229424#Supported_countries&zippy=%2Cwhich-countries-and-languages-are-supported-by-alexa-built-in-on-fitbit" target="_blank">these supported regions</a>, including the U.S.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="v4JvPi57PD3zA7oZzd3Sd8" name="Fitbit-Versa-3-Google-Assistant.jpeg" alt="Fitbit Versa 3 Google Assistant" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v4JvPi57PD3zA7oZzd3Sd8.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jeramy Johnson / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google is following up its earlier community post and email notices with a notification sent to Fitbit watches (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-assistant-on-fitbit-coming-to-end-3545286/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). "Google Assistant on Fitbit watches is being turned down, this feature will stop working in the coming weeks," the notification reads.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/1jzgyj6/google_assistant_going_away">Google assistant going away</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit">r/fitbit</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>It might seem odd that Google, which owns Fitbit, is pushing users away from Google Assistant and toward Amazon Alexa. However, the move appears to be part of larger changes to Google Assistant. The voice assistant has seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-is-dialing-back-more-assistant-features-on-android-and-nest-devices">numerous feature deprecations since the start of 2024</a>, and will soon be replaced on mobile with Gemini.</p><p>Eventually, Gemini will replace Google Assistant on Wear OS, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-on-wear-os-sounds-an-awful-lot-like-google-assistant">at least in name</a>. But since Fitbit smartwatches run Fitbit OS — not Wear OS — it's far from guaranteed that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> will arrive on older Fitbit watches.</p><p>Amidst the announcement of the discontinuation of Assistant on Fitbit watches, there has been no official mention of a voice assistant replacement, aside from the aforementioned Alexa support.</p>

<hr>
<p>After launching the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-3a-and-3a-pro-review">Phone 3a and Phone 3a Pro</a> last month, Nothing is now releasing a slew of new products under its CMF sub-brand. The CMF Buds 2 kick things off as the brand's latest pair of truly-wireless earbuds, which improve sound quality and add a fresh design for $59. It also teased the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which will be the next Nothing phone released under the CMF brand.</p><p>We don't know a whole lot about the CMF Phone 2 Pro just yet, but an official teaser from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/cmfbynothing/status/1912430771585053086/photo/1" target="_blank">Nothing on X (formerly Twitter)</a> reveals the phone's processor. The budget smartphone will be powered by the MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro, with Nothing describing the CMF Phone 2 as "powerful from the core."</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Powerful from the core.

<p>It follows up <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/cmf-by-nothing-phone-2-social-media-teaser">the first teaser Nothing shared</a> earlier this month, revealing the phone's design.</p><p>The MediaTek Dimensity 7300 Pro appears to be an iteration of the Dimensity 7300, which powered the CMF Phone 1. There is a new MediaTek Dimensity 7400 out, but CMF passed on that chipset in favor of a "Pro" version of the Dimensity 7300. Nothing has tweaked MediaTek chipsets before to offer enhanced performance, so this isn't a new concept for the CMF Phone 2 Pro.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CMF Buds 2 slot into the Nothing earbuds lineup right below the CMF Buds 2 Pro. At $59, they cost $10 less than the Buds 2 Pro at retail but represent a $20 increase compared to their predecessor. These products could compete for value in certain markets, as current discounts at U.S. retailers make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/im-convinced-nothings-cmf-buds-pro-2-are-the-only-budget-earbuds-worth-buying">Buds 2 Pro</a> cheaper than the newly-released Buds 2.</p>

<p>OnePlus is all set to launch the 13T on April 24, and is leaving no stone unturned to market its small flagship device.</p><p>The company took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/u/3871046669">Weibo</a> to post an official trailer of the OnePlus 13T, showcasing it from all angles possible. With the caption, "Small screen big devil. OnePlus 13T is officially unveiled!"</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PTcnGy4EcnN7uKvcZdigq8" name="OnePlus 13T-teased" alt="OnePlus officially unveils the 13T" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PTcnGy4EcnN7uKvcZdigq8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus/Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The company stated in the post that the phone is said to sport an all-new design that not only feels light in the hand but is also as powerful as a phone can get. In another post on Weibo, OnePlus showed the upcoming phone being held between the thumb and index finger— mimicking the "OK" hand gesture, implying that the device is as compact as it can get.</p><p>That said, from the looks of it, the OnePlus 13T will show up in three colorways: Black, Sliver, and Pink, with a possible overall matte finish. According to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/the-oneplus-13t-just-inched-closer-to-launch-with-fresh-details-surfacing">previous leak </a>the official names of the colorways could be "Cloud Ink Black, Morning Mist Gray, and Heartbeat Pink."</p>

<p>It also posted several videos and what looks like marketing images showcasing people operating the OnePlus 13T with one hand, and doing their chores with the other (like riding a bike, working on your laptop, etc).</p><p>As for the design, the teaser shows that the phone will sport rounded edges, and an all new squircle rear camera island that houses two lenses and a flash next to it. It sports the volume and the power buttons on one side, and the alleged new shortcut key on on the other side. This could be the first OnePlus that will show up without the alert slider — that will be swapped with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-13t-shortcut-key-alert-slider-replacement-teaser">customizable shortcut button.</a></p>

<p>Talking about the specs of the OnePlus 13T, it will allegedly show up with a 6.31-inch OLED screen with "1.5K" resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate.

<p>OnePlus is finally bringing back its T-series device after three years when the OnePlus 10T launched in 2022.

<p>Google is reportedly working on a few UI changes for its smart home app to make managing it easier.</p><p>A post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-home-ui-changes-matter-apk-teardown-3545210/">Android Authority</a> highlights a few changes the company is working on for the Google Home app. Specifically, these alterations will seemingly impact the Devices and Favorites tabs. An APK teardown shows the Home app could receive a dedicated search icon (magnifying glass) to quickly find saved/favorited connected devices.</p><p>The publication also speculates this would let users easily locate "actions," too.</p><p>On the other hand, the Devices tab is adding another floating button to let users scan the QR codes on smart home products. As the post also notes, this is likely done to improve the experience around setting up Matter-supported devices.</p><p>The Home app's latest version also showcased a slight navigation bar change, which removes the Settings cog wheel. Instead, it seems Google is placing it in your Google Account management menu when tapping your profile icon.</p>

<p>Despite these changes appearing in a teardown, they seem relatively polished. However, it'll likely take a little longer before users see the UI tweaks roll out officially on Android.</p><p>Aside from UI changes, Google has been busy with AI updates for Home, such as the "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-gemini-help-me-create-public-preview">Help me create</a>" prompt. The company gave Public Preview testers a chance to experiment wth this Gemini-powered feature in December. "Help me create" gave testers an easier way to set up automations for lights, security devices, and more. Users can speak their command to Gemini or write a text description of what the automation should contain.</p><p>The test showed users could get quite descriptive as they fulfill the three parameters Gemini requires: the Starter, Condition, and Action. Of course, this early test was designed to handle any unsightly problems before it rolled out to users.</p><p>The company also held a separate Public Preview test that brought "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/google-home-public-preview-gemini-in-assistant-test">Gemini in Assistant</a>" to Nest devices. Gemini's involvement was there to enhance the answers the Assistant delivered to queries. Google said these replies should be more "in-depth" and cover general topics. The test showed users would have the ability to interrupt the Assistant or ask for additional context if they're still unclear.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:33.38%;"><img id="dMirAKYvTUwgEoFeKm3fjM" name="flir-benchmark2.jpg" alt="Thermal images of phones through a Flir camera." src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dMirAKYvTUwgEoFeKm3fjM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="267" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure>
<p>Ever picked up your phone after a long session of scrolling, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/why-game-controller-helped-rethink-mobile-gaming-completely">gaming</a>, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-now-lets-you-continue-watching-videos-your-phone-your-pc">watching videos</a> and noticed it's a little… warm? Or maybe even downright hot? You're not alone! It's a common experience, and while it can be a bit alarming, there's always a perfectly logical explanation. Let's dive into why our trusty pocket computers get a little heated.</p>
<p>First things first—some parts inside your phone or tablet are meant to get hot. They can get crazy hot and peel the skin off of you if you touch them. Things like microprocessors typically run upwards of 75 degrees C and can get <em>a lot</em> hotter.</p><p>Those same parts can also be damaged by heat. It's the phone maker's job to pull the extra away and manage everything to keep it cool enough. Some do better than others.</p><p>The next time you hear some phone manufacturing executive telling you about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/pixel-watch-turns-off-when-extremely-warm">heat pipes</a>, <strong>this</strong> is what they're talking about.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP" name="Pixel-9a-Overheating" alt="The Google Pixel 9a overheating." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tRfhAHdHKDbXuLaznYzpmP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some things make your phone run hot. If you are using it for a loooong period, like you're playing a game, things are under load, and that processor gets extra hot. Things like a bad network connection, being in direct sunlight, or sitting in a hot car can also make things extra toasty.</p><p>Charging is a big culprit, too. Charging, especially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wireless-charging-vs-wired-charging-vs-fast-charging-what-does-actually-mean-efficiency-perspective">fast-charging</a>, creates heat as your battery gets excited. Properly managing this is important, or you might end up with a broken phone or worse.</p>
<p>All this matters. besides getting warm in your hands, heat can degrade the battery, cause the phone's performance to be sluggish due to thermal throttling, or even damage the very same components that are causing the heat.</p><p>Here's the thing — your phone probably never gets hot enough to catch fire or to cause damage to the parts. It may feel too warm to hold, but that's often within normal operating temps and all is fine.</p>
<p>The company that made your phone has to do two things to keep it within the correct operating temperatures: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12-jre-teardown">pull away the heat</a> from the chip, and slow the chip down when it gets too hot. In extreme cases, your phone might have to shut off for a while.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3925px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CLNK7aoaz3xbJ8qT8gZRid" name="redmagic-9-pro-lifestyle-3.jpg" alt="RedMagic 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CLNK7aoaz3xbJ8qT8gZRid.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3925" height="2208" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since most phones are too thin to have a tiny fan inside (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-9-pro-review">RedMagic</a> says hello!), the heat needs to be moved away passively. Parts inside need to absorb the heat and "vent" it off, where it won't cause much harm. When it starts to heat up, the processor is forced to slow down until things are back to normal.</p><p>Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-6-pro-review">Google Pixel 6 </a>were notorious for throttling because of heat, but while we hated it, it was working as designed. The design simply needed some improvements.</p>
<p>There are a few things you can do if your phone is constantly getting too hot, but really you shouldn't have to do anything if the phone maker did its job. We all know how that plays out sometimes.</p><p>Avoid using it for hours on end, especially doing something like playing games. You might have to stop using your favorite case, or try a different charger. Always keep your phone out of direct sun, like sitting on your cars dash.</p><p>If you noticed things getting hot suddenly, check any new apps you might have installed. Some of them love to keep doing things behind the scenes and using the processor makes it hot.</p><p>If none of this helps, you might have to talk to the company that made your phone and see what it has to say.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-warmth-is-normal-2">A little warmth is normal</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3946px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Yx4YUBUyrWVPHuAZnNuLHX" name="Sensi-Touch-Smart-thermostat-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Sensi Touch Smart Thermostat" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Yx4YUBUyrWVPHuAZnNuLHX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3946" height="2219" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Remember, a little warmth is perfectly normal. Your phone is a powerful device, and it generates heat as it works. However, if your phone is consistently overheating or becoming uncomfortably hot, it's worth investigating.</p><p>If you're concerned about your phone's temperature, consider contacting your phone's manufacturer or a qualified technician. They can help diagnose any potential issues and ensure your phone stays cool and healthy.</p><p>Hopefully, this helps you understand why your phone sometimes feels a little toasty. Stay cool!</p>

<p>Google's Wallet app is having an eventful week as the company details what's new and an important feature that'll catch your eye.</p><p>Google Wallet's developer blog posted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/wallet/docs/release-notes#April_15_2025">the latest changelog</a> this week, which includes a real-time status update addition (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/16/google-wallet-train-status/">9to5Google</a>). Currently rolling out are several status updates for trains. Google clarifies that users will only see these real-time updates if they've saved their ticket to Wallet.</p><p>More importantly, this is only arriving for users in India and Canada for Indian Railways and Via Rail, respectively.</p><p>The patch notes state users will receive alerts on their phones with information like "On Time," "Delayed," and more regarding where their train is. It seems Google Wallet will provide the time your train is expected to arrive at the station when delivering any of these real-time updates.</p><p>Additionally, adding a ticket will show the time you're expected to depart from your station and your estimated time of arrival for your destination.</p>
<h2 id="more-in-store-for-wallet-2">More in store for Wallet</h2>

<p>Another noteworthy addition is the ability to add Loyalty and Gift card passes to your Wallet via its homepage on the web. Essentially, this is an integration of Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developers.google.com/wallet/retail/loyalty-cards/use-cases/loyalty-program-enrollment">Loyalty Program</a>. Meanwhile, parents/guardians in "select" countries can now give their child's account permission to add event tickets, generic passes, and more to Wallet. This feature for kids was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/google-wallet-for-kids-family-link/">originally announced</a> in March, stating those in the U.S., U.K., Australia, Spain, and Poland will receive it first.</p><p>Lastly, the company slipped in a little teaser for its upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-io-2025-how-to-watch-what-to-expect">I/O 2025</a> event in May. Google says users can expect to "hear about all the changes" coming to Wallet and Pay from May 21 to May 22.</p><p>Google's I/O conference is expected to start on May 20 this year at 10 am PT. We're expecting quite a bit, such as Android 16, Android XR, Wear OS 6, and maybe even teasers for next-gen Pixel products. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-1-released-enrolled-pixels-detailed">Live Updates</a> are a key aspect expected to arrive in Android 16 this year, which, according to Google, will roll out much earlier in Q2 2025. That release window seems within reach as Android 16 achieved a major milestone: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16-beta-3-launch">Platform Stability</a>.</p><p>In short, this means developers are given one final chance to clean up their apps to avoid any conflicts when the upgrade is released. Android 16 Beta also showcased Google's work to improve the accessibility side of its software, as it includes Auracast support for hearing aids.</p>

<ul><li>The April update for the Galaxy S25 series includes enhancements to camera, charging, and software stability.</li><li>A new media widget notification is introduced, allowing for easy media control in the notification shade.</li><li>The update is initially available in Korea, with a global rollout anticipated soon.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung has started rolling out an April update to its flagship Galaxy S25 series this week, and interestingly, it comes mid-way through the month, while older Galaxy phones still await the One UI 7 update in some regions, including India.</p><p>The monthly update is being observed for the Galaxy S25, S25 Plus, and S25 Ultra models (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-ultra-april-2025-update/">SamMobile</a>). The update seems to be live in the Korean region with the <strong>S938NKSU2AYD9</strong> build number. It further includes improvements to the camera, charging, and general software stability. However, the notable change is seen in the media widget notification in the status bar.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1473px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:40.73%;"><img id="78VXEBSWbpW3HiF9bMpFqC" name="Galaxy-S25-media-playback-Now-Bar-widget" alt="Galaxy S25 series media playback widget" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/78VXEBSWbpW3HiF9bMpFqC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1473" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: SamMobile)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung introduced the Now Bar pill for certain apps with One UI 7 on the Galaxy S25 series, which can be quickly glanced at on the lock screen alongside the status bar. The latest update will be introducing media widget notification for the Galaxy S25 series, which for some reason has been missing on the flagship trio, notes SamMobile — while it was added for older Galaxy phones that received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a> update recently.</p><p>The new pill-shaped media play button will reside in the notification shade right beside the time on the Galaxy S25 series. Alternatively, it can also be seen in the notifications pane. When the live widget in the status bar is clicked, more prominent play controls pop up for easy control on the home screen.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="gLXhUjxb28kwk32NTVhDY6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gLXhUjxb28kwk32NTVhDY6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the latest update is currently confined to the Korean region, a wider rollout is expected soon. Meanwhile, the Galaxy S25 series in the region is recommended to navigate to their phone <em><strong>Settings> Software update> and click Download and Install</strong></em> to check for the latest update.</p><p>On the other hand, the much-anticipated One UI 7 update for older devices like the Galaxy S24 series in some regions seems to have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/serious-bug-pushes-samsung-to-stall-one-ui-7-rollout-globally">pulled from servers</a> as the firmware notably had a serious bug. The initial <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">rollout began</a> on April 7 in Korea, followed by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">U.S. and U.K</a>., however, other major markets like India have still been left out at the moment.</p>

<ul><li>Honor announced a closer partnership with Google Cloud during its Next 2025 event.</li><li>The collaboration will bring a few "co-developed" features to consumers via a new product in May 2025, with help from Veo and Gemini for office tools.</li><li>Honor also reiterates a few of its previously released AI features, like AI Eraser and AI Outpainting for the 400 Lite in Europe.</li><li>The Chinese OEM debuted its Honor Alpha Plan for human-centric AI, an AI ecosystem, and AGI during MWC 2025.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Honor is giving consumers a glimpse into what its strengthened partnership with Google Cloud will bring to the table.</p><p>In a press release, Honor highlighted a trio of major AI features inbound for its device during Google Cloud Next 2025. The company states its "close collaboration" with Google will foster the continuation of on-device and cloud-based AI features. To that end, Honor's Eric Fang, senior director of product planning, teased planned product and productivity features.</p><p>Fang states Honor's upcoming products, which are looking at a May 2025 release, will contain features that leverage <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-veo-2-becomes-widely-available-as-it-teases-gemini-2-5-flash">Google's Veo</a> video generation tech. The Chinese OEM has "co-developed experiences" to help facilitate better motion on its generated content and "enhanced realism." Meanwhile, Fang teased "advanced office tools" for consumers interested in Honor's next products in May with Gemini.</p><p>For the busy-bees, Honor says its newest features should help streamline workflows and provide users with intelligent assistance daily.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:750px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:80.00%;"><img id="WQts25oz7RASzN8RN2ZkfD" name="honor-google-cloud-next-2025-press-photo" alt="Honor announced a closer partnership with Google Cloud during a Next 2025 speech." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WQts25oz7RASzN8RN2ZkfD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="750" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Honor then drew attention to a couple of AI features co-developed with Google Cloud called AI Outpainting and AI Eraser. The former redefined post-processing function that leverages Google's Imagen software, so users can expand a photo up to "twice their original size." The feature appears alongside Honor's AiMAGE Suite, letting users "reframe and rotate" pictures after snapping.</p><p>The feature's goal is help users worry less about perfecting framing their shots. Fang adds, "The optimized generative fill ensures the expanded images are seamlessly integrated, even in complex scenes like buildings and landscapes."</p><p>Elsewhere, Honor reiterates AI Eraser — which many Pixel owners will recognize. This function erases unwanted content from photos while leveraging on-device AI software to "realistically" fill in the gap with content that fits. These two AI features, alongside AI Upscale, rolled out with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/the-honor-400-lite-5g-is-iphone-copying-gone-too-far">Honor 400 Lite</a> in Europe earlier in April.

<p>Honor set down a more AI-focused path for its devices earlier this year when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-alpha-plan-mwc-2025-tease">teased what users would see</a> at MWC 2025. Promptly in March, the OEM revealed its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honor-unveils-global-ai-strategy-with-usd-ten-billion">Alpha Plan</a>, a three-step strategy centered around intelligent phones. That's not all, as Honor also honed in on an AI ecosystem and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) to "open human potential boundaries and co-create a new paradigm for civilization."</p><p>Its announcement during MWC 2025 brought our initial glimpse of its AiMAGE Suite. Honor stated the suite piggybacks off an AI kernel to run device-cloud AI software for the sake of enhancing the clarity of photos. Through its partnership with Google Cloud and Qualcomm Technologies, Honor is positioning itself to introduce AI features that can reserve restaurant tables for its consumers through third-party sources.</p><p>Honor informed users that its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/honors-latest-ai-features-want-to-fight-deep-fake-videos-and-eye-strain">DeepFake Detection software</a> would make its way to flagship models and foldables in international markets.</p>

While this leak doesn't talk much about the base and Pro variants, it suggests that the Pixel 10 Pro XL could see a $100 price increase, while the Pixel 10 Pro Fold could see a $300 reduction in price.</p><p>With every flagship device, Google tries to improve its features and overall experience with its premium phones. These advancements would require the company to invest more in Research and Development (R&D), marketing, etc, which could impact the whole pricing game. Before we get into that, it's helpful to understand Google's pricing strategy over the years.</p>
<h2 id="google-pixel-s-pricing-trends-over-the-years-2">Google Pixel's pricing trends over the years</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZqxAdJriP3PzU3PbjVMbzK" name="Google-Pixel-pricing-history" alt="Google Pixel Prices over the years" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZqxAdJriP3PzU3PbjVMbzK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/6096/google-smartphone-prices/">Statista</a>)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Historically, the first-gen base Google Pixel was priced at $649, and the company bumped the price of the device two years later when it released the Pixel 3 at $799, the reason being that the Pixel 3 got an upgraded processor, dual front cameras, wireless charging, and more.</p><p>Later, Google shifted its strategy and decreased the cost of its<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-5-looks-back-basics-model-we-can-get-excited-about"> Pixel 5</a>, to $699—$100 less than its previous model. This phone was released during the pandemic, a time when consumers were very reluctant to buy a new device due to economic uncertainty. Google felt that a lower price point could favor the tech giant over other players in the market.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>I don’t think there are any special considerations or features that Pixel or any other phone maker needs to make to justify any added costs that come from tariffs.</p><figcaption><cite>Jitesh Ubrani</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>The next two generations of the base model also saw a 100$ dip in pricing, after that, it picked up with the Pixel 8 which costs $699, while the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9 </a>now sits at $799 with a $100 price hike.</p><p>According to Jitesh Ubrani, research manager for IDC's Worldwide Mobile Device Trackers, companies don't need to justify why they increase pricing, which comes with added tariffs or manufacturing.</p><p>"Many companies have already gone on record stating that tariffs are going to lead to price increases and Google won’t be treated any differently," he explained. However, it's important to note that as of now, Trump has recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">exempted</a> electronics from any reciprocal tariffs.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-10.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL angled view" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ppx2XnXUjksHgLDqz4RePJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you look at the Pro model's pricing it has remained consistent over the past few generations. Initially, Google used the "XL" term variant, and later with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/pixel-6-first-phone-im-excited-about-long-time">Pixel 6</a>, the variant was rebranded as the "Pro" model.</p><p>By maintaining a consistent price point, the company wanted to make premium features more accessible, pushing for wider adoption. It also allowed Google to keep up with competition, giving consumers more predictability, which made it easier for them to decide on buying a phone even before launch.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE" name="google-pixel-9-pro-pixel-9-pro-xl-7.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL in tree" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5qjmyvhuj5Y9BbVDENCrpE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>That said, Google wanted to do something different with the Pixel 9 series. To remain relevant and on par with its competitors, it launched three distinct models — it added the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-vs-pixel-9-pro">Pixel 9 Pro </a>to the lineup, bringing a smaller version of the Pro XL.</p><p>While the only difference between the above two variants could be the size, Ubrani adds that "the customer segment between the Pro and Pro XL likely has a lot of overlap to begin with."</p><p>Further explaining that the Pixel 10 Pro XL might see a 100$ hike in price, Ubrani notes that this could likely be because the variant is produced in smaller quantities, the company could be trying to make up for the higher production costs with the increased pricing.</p>
<h2 id="price-hike-and-its-impact-on-consumers-2">Price hike and its impact on consumers</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7TBXngN82WckdZx2MEU2ZJ" name="Android Central Best of 2024" alt="Android Central's best of 2024 phone and accessories selection" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TBXngN82WckdZx2MEU2ZJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When a company announces a price increase, generally, consumers will likely weigh the pros and cons before spending on the new device, comparing whether the features and specs offered are worth the extra expense or not. And whether they feel that a $100 price increase on the Pixel 10 Pro XL is justified,  just for its larger size.</p><p>However, Ubrani notes that shifts in pricing don't depend only on one feature, but it's more of an overall experience that dictates the increase in prices, and despite fluctuations in smartphone prices, a significant number of users wouldn't notice or care about it. This is due to the dominance of financing and or trade-in offers, which lessen the blow to their pockets brought by the rising costs of these devices.</p><p>Ubrani elaborates that shifts in consumer mindset have been driving these price increases. "Over the past few years, we have seen an influx of buy now, pay later schemes or trade-in offers, which have made it easier for the consumer to digest the increase in phone prices."</p><p>Moreover, in an unstable economic climate brought in by the tariffs or other geopolitical factors, Google "can easily shift blame away from itself and towards the political uncertainties," he added.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3FGYqBKJBN3vqWm7LtVoeC" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-6.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold in leaves" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3FGYqBKJBN3vqWm7LtVoeC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<figure><blockquote><p>This is perhaps the most interesting rumor right now about Pixel pricing. By lowering prices on the fold, Google can perhaps kickstart adoption.</p><figcaption><cite>Jitesh Ubrani</cite></figcaption></blockquote></figure>
<p>Along with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a>, came a premium foldable—<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-hands-on"> Pixel 9 Pro Fold </a>which costs around $1,799, which seems reasonable since foldables <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/phones/google-pixel-phones/google-pixel-10-fold-price-just-leaked-and-it-could-be-a-tipping-point-for-foldable-phones">typically</a> sit between $1,600 - $1,800 and can go upwards of $2,000 or more based on storage configurations.</p><p>Per the recent rumor, Google could allegedly drop the price of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold to $1,600. Such a move could be industry-changing as these top-tier devices are typically quite expensive. Ubrani feels that lowering the price point of the fold could help Google kickstart the adoption of this device.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.00%;"><img id="qyZ8vKm3vXNMGK4A5T7mee" name="Foldables-market-2024-25" alt="Line graph indicating foldable sales in 2024-25" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qyZ8vKm3vXNMGK4A5T7mee.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="868" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Counterpoint)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>"It may also help Google push up their average selling prices across the lineup a bit further, and assuming the design stays the same as the previous version, then Google can pass off some of the savings in R&D to end users," Ubrani added.</p><p>If one major company like Google makes this move, it could trigger other top players in the foldable scene like Samsung, OnePlus, and Huawei to decrease the cost of their foldables as well. This price adjustment could help improve the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.displaysupplychain.com/press-release/foldable-smartphone-market-stalls-in-2024-and-2025">already slumping foldable market</a>.</p><p>But it remains to be seen if Google will end up reducing the cost of its foldable just so it can increase its footprint in the foldable market. However, this is still a rumor, and whether or not the tech giant could go ahead with this will ultimately depend on other factors like manufacturing costs, competitive pricing, and overall market strategy.</p>

It covers phones, tablets, and everything in between.</p></div></div>
<p>I'm a little late in the game, but I finally got my hands on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy S24 FE</a> in late March so I could do some additional testing. I enjoy camera deep dives and display analysis for Android Central Labs, and while I fully expected this to be a run-of-the-mill Samsung release, the display really surprised me.</p><p>But it's not the color accuracy or some other "normal" display metric that impressed me. It's the High Brightness Mode (HBM). This special mode exists on all modern phones and typically turns on when the automatic brightness sensor detects something as bright as sunlight. But the Galaxy S24 FE's does something different from every other Samsung phone I've tested: it switches to DC dimming, unlocking the full brightness potential of the display.</p><p>Typically, all Samsung Galaxy phones with AMOLED screens use <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-pwm-display-flicker-tips-and-tricks">PWM dimming</a> at all brightness levels, withholding the display's true maximum brightness level. Not only that, but PWM dimming makes people like me feel awful within just a few minutes, hurting my eyes and giving me a headache. That gives the S24 FE's HBM a unique advantage that other Samsung phones don't have, and it makes me wonder why Samsung doesn't use it more often.</p>

<p>My normal display testing procedure involves a light meter to determine brightness levels and flickering potential, a microscope to see the subpixel arrangement and if the display dithers, and a flashlight to force High Brightness Mode so I can separately measure how a display behaves in the sun.</p><p>It was during this flashlight test — where I turn on the torch on a smartphone and hold it near the top of the display — where I found the S24 FE's special mode kick in. Theoretically, we could make Samsung flagships more eye-friendly by forcing High Brightness Mode on all the time and then using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dev.rewhex.screendimmer">a screen dimmer app</a> to reduce the brightness a different way, but we have to figure out how to force HBM all the time in the first place.</p><p>I checked all my usual sources on Reddit, Telegram, and even among other groups of tech journalists and no one seemed to know how other than what I had already done. It's not exactly viable to walk around holding a flashlight up to your phone, so there had to be another way.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>High Brightness Mode is something that only kicks in when a bright light source (like the sun) is shining on the display.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>Searching the Google Play Store for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=force%20high%20brightness%20mode&c=apps">apps that do the job</a> returns lots of results. I spent money on several apps but none of them worked. Google has changed a lot on the backend of Android in recent years and system-level functions like HBM aren't typically accessible to apps without root access, so this was a dead-end.</p><p>So I turned to ADB, the command line solution for all your Android modification needs. I dialed down into /sys/class/backlight/panel and found the max_brightness setting I was looking for. You can force HBM on some Android phones by using a command like "echo 1 >> /sys/class/backlight/panel/max_brightness" to change this setting to 1, which means "enabled."</p><p>Unfortunately, I got a "permission denied" response, which meant I had to have root access to do this. Rooting a Samsung phone is bad news, as it trips Knox security and requires all kinds of tomfoolery to get things working properly again so, yet again, this was a dead-end.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>High Brightness Mode often doubles the display's peak brightness, unleashing its full potential.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>So then I got more desperate. What could possibly trick a sensor into thinking it's in the sun? I tried applying a piece of foil to the screen, but that didn't work. Light sensors are passive acceptors of light, not producers, but I hoped the foil would cause some kind of loop by reflecting the display and causing it to think it was under brighter lighting conditions. Oh well.</p><p>Maybe taping an LED to the screen and covering it would work? Sure, this was a potential solution but it not only requires some kind of external power supply for the LED, but it's obviously not a full-time solution as it's both bulky and trashy looking.</p><p>No, the only real solution is for Samsung to allow users to enable High Brightness Mode manually, something we'd have to petition en-masse to achieve.</p>
<h2 id="high-brightness-full-potential-2">High brightness, full potential</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="DYRStxqKGJHqHJ9LaccASf" name="s24-fe-s24-ultra-s25-ultra-HBM" alt="Comparing High Brightness Mode brightness dips between the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, S24 Ultra, and S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DYRStxqKGJHqHJ9LaccASf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy S24 FE's high brightness mode is the only AMOLED-powered Samsung Galaxy phone I have in my posession that switches away from PWM dimming to DC dimming. If you're not familiar with PWM dimming, here's the quick gist.</p><p>AMOLED has the ability to quickly turn on and off its pixels, delivering better motion resolution with little to no ghosting, unlike some LCD panels. But AMOLED also has a problem: reducing voltage can sometimes introduce lower color accuracy and random noise patterns. Engineers have cleverly borrowed pulse width modulation (PWM) from other types of electronics — like fans and pumps — which turns the voltage off and on to "regulate" the amount sent to the component.</p><p>On the display side, this essentially turns your phone's display into a strobe light. Normally, you can't see this strobing because it's done so quickly. Instead, your eyes perceive the display as brighter or dimmer depending on how long the display stays off during this flickering behavior.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="xPRhavT5H37Zw7aSuG5oKZ" name="samsung-galaxy-s24-fe-brightness-comparison" alt="Comparing maximum brightness modes on the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE, including PWM rates" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xPRhavT5H37Zw7aSuG5oKZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But while this behavior ensures better color accuracy and smoother details in some circumstances, it also introduces <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/late-2024-led-flicker-research-smartphones">negative health effects</a> and artificially limits the maximum brightness of your phone's display. Flagship Samsung phones like the Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra never reach their actual maximum brightness potential because they use PWM dimming at all times, even during high brightness mode.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>DC-like dimming doesn't just unlock the display's full brightness potential, it also makes it more eye-friendly for people sensitive to flickering.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>You can see this illustrated in the image above. On the left side, you'll see what Samsung calls "100% brightness" with the "extra brightness" option enabled. It's pretty obvious the display isn't actually outputting "100%" brightness as the thick black lines detected with a 1/6400 camera shutter speed show how long the display stays off during the PWM dimming cycle. Clearly, "100%" in this case is an arbitrary number crafted by Samsung rather than the actual maximum output of the display.</p><p>The Galaxy S24 FE on the right is using High Brightness Mode, triggered by me holding a flashlight up to the top of the display for a few seconds. This recreates sunlight conditions and kicks the display up to its <em>actual</em> maximum brightness which, based on my measurements, is <strong>double the brightness level</strong> of "100%" brightness.</p><p>During this special high brightness mode, the display stays on most of the time and doesn't use the harsh PWM flickering cycle it typically uses at all other brightness levels. This dimming method is known as "DC-like" dimming on OLEDs because it more closely follows how a traditional lightbulb or LCD dims itself, which is substantially more eye-friendly than the artificial methods Samsung typically employs.</p>

<figure><blockquote><p>Samsung devices are commonly about being everything to everybody, and it's time Samsung delivers on that promise with its displays.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>It's actually quite surprising that Samsung doesn't give users full access to the different brightness modes available, including different dimming options, given the company's penchant for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/good-lock-one-ui-7-update-is-great">letting users fully customize</a> their phones.</p><p>Instead, Samsung continues to limit its displays in bizarre ways. Not only do you only have access to about half the potential brightness of your display — or less on the Ultra models — but you're forced to use harmful low-Hz PWM dimming on most Samsung phones.</p><p>Samsung, it's time to give users the full range of choices they want on their displays. That "extra brightness" setting should mean enabling High Brightness Mode, not some arbitrary number you come up with. Users should be allowed to choose the dimming method that works for them, not just the one you decide on an arbitrary basis. Samsung devices are commonly about being everything to everybody, and it's time Samsung delivers on that promise with its displays.</p>

<p>I got the USB-C version of the AirPods Max, and I was excited about plugging these into my gaming machine and using them as my daily driver. However, that wasn't possible as they wouldn't connect via USB-C — until now. Apple has started delivering the update to unlock 24-bit/48 kHz lossless audio via USB-C (you'll need to update to build 7E101), and it makes the AirPods Max so much better.</p><p>Now that I'm finally able to connect the headset to Windows, I wanted to see how good they actually are, so I paired the AirPods Max against my audio setup, which includes an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/audeze-mm-500-review">Audeze MM-500</a> that's hooked up to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/fiio-k19-review">Fiio K19 DAC</a>. Although the MM-500 are aimed at mastering, they have a vibrant sound that lends itself well to gaming and casual listening, and I've been using the headphones for over a year. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Audeze-MM-500-Professional-Over-Ear-Headphones/dp/B0B837YJSY">MM-500 retailing for $1,699</a> and the Fiio K19 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/FiiO-K19-ES9039SPRO-Desktop-31-Band/dp/B0D1Y6M3W6">coming in at $1,364</a>, the two products cost more than six times as much as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Headphones-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized/dp/B0DGJC52FP">$479 AirPods Max</a>. <br><br>As is the case with all Apple products, the AirPods Max have tight integration with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone</a>, iPad, and macOS devices. While there's no mention of Windows, I was able to connect the headphones to my Windows 11 gaming machine without any issues via the provided USB-C to USB-C cable. Windows detected the AirPods Max as headphones, and I was able to use the 24-bit/48 kHz mode to take full advantage of the audio potential.</p>

<p>I immediately put the AirPods Max to the test, launching Roon and listening to some of my favorite albums. The headphones held up better than I imagined, and were thoroughly enjoyable to use. That said, they didn't quite measure up to the open-backed MM-500; Audeze's headphones delivered a significantly cleaner sound with a rumbling low-end, crystal-clear mids, and detailed treble. The Max have a good low-end, but the recessed mids makes vocals sound a tad artificial, and you don't get the same engaging soundstage.</p>

<p>That was always going to be the case considering the use case of either headset, and even $349 closed-back products like the Beyerdynamic DT 1770 Pro sound much better. But where AirPods Max win out is the sheer versatility; they can be used in a wide variety of settings that just isn't feasible with the MM-500 or the DT 1770 Pro.</p>

<p>The MM-500 has been sitting on my desk this past year, while I took the AirPods Max with me on flights, paired it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> and used it to watch movies and TV shows, and used it while working out. The biggest bonus is the ANC; the AirPods Max have the best noise isolation of any headphones I used, and that's immediately evident even from switching from the Sony WH-1000XM5. <br><br>While they are heavier than most Bluetooth headphones, they don't have anywhere close to the same heft as the MM-500, and the mesh headband does a great job distributing the weight while providing good ventilation. They also have a cleaner design, and the blue variant I'm using looks pretty stylish. They also have just the right amount of clamping force, and don't exert too much pressure — a key consideration for prolonged use.</p>

<p>What I like the most about the lossless audio update is that I can plug in the AirPods Max to my iPad Pro; I dabble in music production, and the ability to plug in the headset is highly convenient. Don't get me wrong; they did a decent enough job over Bluetooth, but they sound better when plugged in, and there's no latency whatsoever. <br><br>If anything, my main issue with the AirPods Max is the case; it does little to safeguard the mesh headband, and I constantly worry about it getting damaged whilst in my bag (though not so much to actually buy a hard shell case). Outside of that, the AirPods Max have been fantastic in daily use, and the ability to plug them to my Windows machine and use lossless audio makes these a standout choice.</p>

<ul><li>Identity Check was spotted on a OnePlus 13 running the Android 16 beta.</li><li>The feature is expected to arrive on more Android phones with the Android 16 update coming later this year.</li><li>It requires a change to Android's biometric prompt code, which can't be completed without a full update.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Identity Check is a useful Android feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your devices when they're outside of trusted location, and there's a chance it could arrive on more supported phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>. As of now, Identity Check only works on select Google Pixel and Samsung Galaxy devices.</p><p>However, it was recently spotted on a OnePlus 13 running the Android 16 beta, hinting that Identity Check will be more widely available soon (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-identity-check-3544525/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). After upgrading to Android 16, the Identity Check option became available in the <strong>Settings > Google > Theft Protection</strong>, where features like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-adds-anti-theft-security-features-like-theft-detection-lock">Theft Detection Lock and Offline Device Lock</a> are also found on supported devices.</p><p>When enabled, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-enable-identity-check">Identity Check</a> requires biometric authentication to view or modify certain sensitive parts on your Android smartphone. A fingerprint or face unlock is required for the following actions when your device is outside of a trusted location:</p>
<ul><li>Accessing saved passkeys and app passwords</li><li>Changing PIN, pattern, or password, and turning off Find My</li></ul>
<p>For these actions, biometric authentication is mandatory outside of trusted locations with Identity Check enabled — a password, PIN, or pattern won't work as an alternative. This is intended to prevent people from hijacking your Google account or other online accounts in the event your phone is lost or stolen, even if the bad actor knows your password.</p>

<p>Android expert Mishaal Rahman reports that the delay in bringing Identity Check to other Android phones is because the feature requires a full OS upgrade. This is because Identity Check eliminates the PIN/password/pattern fallback, which is part of biometric prompt code that can't be changed with a basic update. As such, other Android phones can receive Identity Check by upgrading to Android 16 or with a manual upgrade.</p><p>For instance, Samsung added Identity Check with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">One UI 7</a>, which released later than most manufacturers' Android 15-based upgrades. Google added it with Android 15 QPR1 for Pixel phones. All other Android manufacturers can create an update with Identity Check, now fully supported in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15-qpr1-beta-3-1-rolls-out-ahead-of-expected-december-launch">Android 15 QPR1</a>, or simply wait for Android 16 to roll out.</p><p>Since the Android 16 upgrade will automatically include Identity Check, this is how most users of Android phones that aren't a Pixel or Galaxy will likely get the feature. It isn't expected to be enabled by default, and will support any phone with class three biometric hardware.</p>

It used to give out gift cards on Black Friday while keeping the Quest 2 and 3 at full price, and the Quest 3 512GB hasn't fallen below $499 since its 2023 launch. That context should make it clear how rare this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-3S-128GB-All-One/dp/B0DDK1WM9K"><strong>$30 discount on the Meta Quest 3S 128GB ($269)</strong></a> is!</p><p>Meta did discount the Quest 3S 256GB in January, but that still cost $350.

After April 30, you'll have to pay the full $50 for this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/batman-arkham-shadow-review">fantastic AAA title</a> that lives up to the hype as one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">best Meta Quest games</a> ever.</p>

<p>If you buy the Quest 3S <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s">from Meta directly</a>, you can save $30 on the headset <em>and</em> another $20 on the official Carrying Case.</p><p>Of course, I can also point you to a "free" Meta Quest 3S deal from Verizon, if $269 sounds like too much.</p><p>Upgrade your home internet to Verizon 5G Home Plus, and the carrier will give you a free Meta Quest 3S 128GB (or 43-inch Samsung TV) to go with your plan if you use it for at least six months. Depending on how much you spend on internet now — and whether you prefer 5G or cable — getting the free Quest 3S could be the cherry on top of better service.</p>

When it does, buyers will soon realize that the Honor 400 Lite 5G is an attempt at creating a carbon copy of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro</a> at a fraction of the price, down to the dedicated camera button and unmistakable rear camera housing.</p><p>While certain Android phones try to copy the iPhone all the time, this is arguably the most egregious example we've ever seen.</p><p>The idea companies of "copying" or "stealing" designs or features isn't always a problem. If brands notice what is working for their competitors, borrowing what works and ditching what doesn't, the entire market grows.</p><p>For instance, multiple Android brands upped their software support guarantee after Google's seven-year promise debuted. Samsung and OnePlus borrowed Apple's titanium frame idea for some of their handsets. In the end, it's a good thing. Now, people have phones that will run newer Android versions longer and are made out of strong and light materials.</p><p>It's not like Apple doesn't steal features from Android phones, either — Live Voicemail in iOS is a direct ripoff of Pixel's Call Screen, and Offline Maps just came to iOS recently despite being available on Android since 2012.</p><p>With that being said, it's hard not to look at the design of the Honor Magic 400 Lite 5G and cringe. There's something about this particular iPhone lookalike that feels shameless, and it has me wondering why Android brands don't try to find their own identity.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.93%;"><img id="ZpKXyJJxd9UA45vhuavVQC" name="Honor-400-Lite-" alt="The Honor 400 Lite 5G in a press photo." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZpKXyJJxd9UA45vhuavVQC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1500" height="1109" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Honor)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few things about the Honor 400 Lite 5G that feel particularly corny, but the biggest one is the rear camera housing. It has an almost-identical shape to the one you'll find on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-vs-iphone-16-pro">iPhone 16 Pro</a> and Pro Max, minus Honor's triangular accents. Aside from the fact that the cameras are clearly positioned to mimic the iPhone camera layout, the real problem here is the 400 Lite 5G's flash.</p><p>That's right — if you look closely, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-honor-phones">Honor</a> 400 Lite 5G is using a dual-camera system. It appears to be intended to look like a triple-camera layout from afar, just like the iPhone 16 Pro. But in reality the third "lens" is just the flash. It's hard to think of a reason to design the flash in this way unless the goal was to make the 400 Lite 5G look more premium than it actually is.</p><p>Then, there's the camera button, which is an obvious Camera Control ripoff. On its own, Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-iphone-16s-camera-control-button-is-actually-cool-i-want-it-on-android-phones">borrowing the Camera Control button isn't a horrible move</a>. Like the Action button, the Camera Control button is one iPhone feature I think more Android phones should copy.</p>

<p>It's the <em>way</em> Honor implemented the dedicated camera button that makes the 400 Lite 5G feel like a cheap knockoff. The button appears to be placed in the exact same place as the iPhone 16 Pro equivalent, and is similarly recessed. This is all true despite the fact that iPhone 16 Pro users — including myself — seem to agree that the Camera Control button is poorly placed. Honor could've improved on this button, and instead it merely copied it.</p><p>It doesn't help that Honor is calling the AI Camera Button "innovative" and "unique" in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250411857642/en/HONOR-400-Lite-5G-Launches-with-108MP-AI-Camera-and-Unique-AI-Camera-Button" target="_blank">press release</a>, which sounds borderline insulting to potential buyers who know they've seen this exact thing before on the iPhone. Even the incorporation of AI and Google Lens matches up with Visual Intelligence on an iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>Android Central reached out to both Honor and Apple for comment but did not immediately hear back. We will update this article with more information.</p>
<h2 id="honor-s-400-lite-5g-takes-a-step-backward-2">Honor's 400 Lite 5G takes a step backward</h2>
<p>Put simply, this is a regression for the Honor 400 Lite 5G. The overall design, camera arrangement, Dynamic Island-like camera cutout, and AI Camera Button all feel shamelessly <em>inspired</em> by the iPhone 16 Pro.</p><p>The new design of the Honor 400 Lite 5G is worse when you consider what we lost — a unique design of Honor <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">budget and midrange phones</a>. Compared to both the Honor 300 series and the Honor 200 Lite that this phone replaces, I much prefer the older models.</p>

<p>Instead, we have yet another iPhone lookalike. While I commend <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones">Honor</a> for being the first Android manufacturer to incorporate a Camera Control-esque button on their smartphone, it should've done so without sacrificing its uniqueness.</p>

<hr>
<p>New reports pile on the in-house chip rumors for Xiaomi as the company allegedly makes a big move to secure that future.</p><p>The report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ithome.com/0/845/431.htm">ITHome</a> (Chinese) cites supposed sources that claim Xiaomi has "internally" announced the start of a "chip platform department"(via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2025/04/15/xiaomi-establishes-dedicated-chip-platform-department-to-advance-its-in-house-chip-ambitions/">Gizmochina</a>). The OEM is looking to reduce its reliance on outside sources for chips for its future devices. As such, Xiaomi allegedly tapped Qin Muyun, with history as Qualcomm's former senior director of product marketing to lead the department.</p><p>There isn't much left to chew through as Xiaomi hasn't announced the existence of its chip platform department officially to the public.</p><p>Reports add Qin Muyun will report to Xiaomi's Li Jun, the general manager of its product department.</p><p>The post by Gizmochina reiterates recent leaks about Xiaomi's first alleged in-house chip, which could pack flagship specs — at least in one area. The publication claims the chip could feature a Cortex X925 core at 3.2GHz, which is the same one found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400 SoC</a>. The other cores are rumored to come from a past-generation, leading some to believe Xiaomi may skip its flagships with its first chip.</p>

<p>Reports about Xiaomi's growing interest in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-pursues-in-house-developed-phone-chip-report">manufacturing in-house chips</a> surfaced in November. The Chinese OEM's close relationship with Qualcomm was highlighted; however, Xiaomi is more interested in becoming "self-sufficient" instead. MediaTek is another company Xiaomi would like to cut back from. While the company has actively worked with Qualcomm for SoCs, it states it's implemented additions atop the brand's chips for its consumers.</p><p>One such addition involved upgrades to improve power management capabilities and "graphic enhancements."</p><p>This was a long-time aspiration for Xiaomi's Chairman and CEO Lei Jun, who stated in October the company would invest roughly 30 billion yuan (~$4.1 billion) in 2025 for in-house chips. Rumors state could enter mass production sometime this year.</p><p>Xiaomi also faces the possibility of leaning on TSMC, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-made-by-tsmc-in-the-works">like Google's did</a> when it broke away from Samsung. The true power of Xiaomi's future custom chip is unknown. Moreover, where we could see it first appear is unclear, though it may happen in late 2025 if not 2026.</p>

If my wife and I ever wanted to listen to music at the same time, I'd either have to take my phone offline completely, or one of us just wouldn't listen to music at all. This isn't the first time it has happened either, but if I have anything to say about it, it'll be the last.</p><p>It all started back in November when I accepted a free 6-month trial to one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google Gemini</a> advanced programs. This particular one included a YouTube Premium subscription as part of its model, which Google believes will help incentivize users to pay a little extra to get a lot of value. The problem is that I already had a YouTube Premium family subscription.</p><p>Worse yet, even some YouTube <em>videos</em> would cause my account to error out like this, making it beyond irritating to try to play the music I was paying for. Google was powerless to fix it because of one reason or another, ensuring my winter was filled with Silent Nights in more than one way until that blasted trial ended <em><strong>six months later</strong></em>.</p>
<h2 id="falling-on-deaf-ears-2">Falling on deaf ears</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="N5NeCiKTvsaGz6X4UWB5jf" name="youtube-music-premium-trial-overlap" alt="Overlapping YouTube Premium and trial accounts in the YouTube Music app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N5NeCiKTvsaGz6X4UWB5jf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>At first, it took me a while to figure out what happened. Out of nowhere, I started getting these "playback paused because your account is being used in another location" errors in YouTube Music. That can't be possible, I thought; I have a family plan and nowhere near the maximum number of people on it!</p><p>Simultaneously, I also noticed a new "upgrade" button in the bottom right corner of my YouTube Music app. I assumed maybe it was a ploy by Google to get me to subscribe to one of its more expensive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google One</a> plans or something similar, but it turns out this button appeared because <em>my account</em> had been flagged as a trial account.</p><p>Of course, this made no sense. I already had a family premium account, as evidenced by the photo above, yet a second trial was stacked on top and marked as the primary subscription for the account. So I did what any good paying customer would do: I asked for the manager.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="osyVGRPvc4ZtTqJPCaAXnf" name="youtube-music-premium-trial-upgrade-02" alt="An upgrade button on the bottom of the YouTube Music app that's only present when a trial is active on an account" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osyVGRPvc4ZtTqJPCaAXnf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>YouTube Music support ran me through some steps I was hopeful would work. I was directed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/googleone/answer/9056360?sjid=11775026802180788269-NC">cancel my paid Google One plan</a> and let the trial take precedence, offloading the subscription cost from my budget for a while. That sounded great, but it didn't work.</p><p>Next, they had me <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://one.google.com/settings">disable family sharing</a> on my Google One account to see if that would trigger a system-side permissions dialog or something similar, assuming that the problem was first caused by the trial not including family plan permissions. No dice. Even re-enabling family sharing didn't fix it.</p><p>At this point, support identified the stacked trial account as the underlying problem but said there's nothing they could do about it. Apparently, Google support doesn't have the power to alter subscriptions or cancel trials; only the user can.</p>
<figure><blockquote><p>Google was powerless to fix the problem I had accidentally made by accepting a free trial, and that's unacceptable.</p></blockquote></figure>
<p>But the biggest problem, of course, is that <em>there's no way to cancel a trial</em> once it has begun. Again, YouTube support confirmed this awful design, and my press contacts later confirmed it. The only thing I could do was wait until April 11, and I had 5 months to go by the time this was fully figured out.</p><p>So here I am on the other side of April 11, <strong>confirming</strong> that this was, in fact, the issue the entire time. Over the last three days, my wife and I have purposefully tested out all sorts of ways to play back music on multiple devices, and we never received a playback error. Everything worked as it should! Huzzah!</p><p>The moral of the story is this: watch out when you accept a free trial. Sometimes, a free trial can make you aware of some amazing value you didn't know existed, or even get you linked up with a service you can't wait to pay for. Other times, it might just ruin your day and keep it ruined for months. Don't be like me, just stay away from those stupid Google One and Gemini trials if you already pay for these services. They'll do nothing but cause problems.</p>

This meant that your search results came from <em>google.ng</em> if you were in Nigeria, for example. This allowed the company to curate its results better to (hopefully) ensure they were more relevant.</p>
<p>Google has been working on ways to improve this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/making-search-results-more-local-and-relevant/" target="_blank">since 2017</a>, and it thinks it has reached the point where ccTLD redirects are no longer needed and all searches are in the process of being "un-re-directed" back to plain old google.com.</p><p>The company says you might need to re-enter some of your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-search-quick-settings-web-redesign">search preferences</a> once this happens for you, but promises that the results will be the same as you're used to seeing. The difference is what's going on up in the browser's address bar.</p>

<p>Yep, this is dry, boring news that most people either don't care about or just don't understand. But it does tell me one thing — hiding the full web address in your browser's bar — something I have hated seeing since it started being a thing — was probably the right call. It seems that the geniuses at tech companies are once again smarter than Jerry is.</p><p>Case in point: I, and plenty of other <del>paranoid</del> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-phone-security">security-conscious</a> people like me, have long told you that it's very important to check the URL of any website you've visited to make sure it is legit. Seeing google.co.kr (South Korea) or google.co.br (Brazil) would be an immediate red flag to someone who isn't super tech savvy, but knew why they needed to make sure they were at the right place. You went to Google and searched for something, so you would assume that the results would come from Google, not "Google.something else."</p>

<p>This is a trap a lot of people writing about tech, as well as people who understand how it works, can fall into. It's easy to assume that anyone would know why this is happening and that it was OK, and that's just wrong. Plenty of well-adjusted "normal" people do not care about this kind of thing. They use their phone or laptop because they enjoy it, never caring to go any deeper.</p><p>When a company like Apple or Google does something to dumb down the tech experience, they are not thinking about people who write for a tech publication or people who regularly read them. They are thinking about the vast majority of people who have no interest in how the fudge is made.</p><p>I'm still going to hate it every time, and you probably will, too. But companies like Google won't care. Maybe they shouldn't after all.</p>

<ul><li>Google is moving to the google.com domain for Search around the world.</li><li>Previously, Google used country-coded domains for regions outside the U.S.</li><li>The experience of using Google Search won't change, as Google has been using physical location to localize Search since 2017.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google has long used country-coded domains for non-U.S. regions, like google.co.uk for the United Kingdom or google.ng for Nigeria. For a while, these country-specific URLs were crucial in providing locally-relevant results in response to user queries.</p><p>However, since 2017, Google has been using your real-time location to provide relevant results — making the country codes redundant. As such, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/country-code-top-level-domains/" target="_blank">announced</a> today, April 15 that it is phasing out country code top-level domain names (ccTLD).</p><p>Beginning now, Google will be moving country-specific <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-app-android-ai-mode-search-bar-test">Search</a> domains to the main google.com URL. The process will be part of a gradual rollout lasting "over the coming months."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="H668jKUNrYyRWCJvQL4z3D" name="google-SGE-hero.jpg" alt="Google generative AI in Search" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H668jKUNrYyRWCJvQL4z3D.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The change is intended to streamline the experience of using Google Search regardless of your country or location, per the company. Search itself isn't changing, but as part of the switch, users may have to enter some of their preferences again for the new domain.</p><p>As has been the case since 2017, Google will use your physical location to localize your search results. For instance, if you're living in the U.S., you will get the Search experience for France if you travel to Paris. When you go back, you'll automatically be switched to the U.S. experience again.</p><p>"It’s important to note that while this update will change what people see in their browser address bar, it won’t affect the way Search works, nor will it change how we handle obligations under national laws," the company said in the blog post.</p>

<ul><li>A 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 model has appeared with an FCC listing.</li><li>OnePlus will likely use the Oppo Watch X2 Mini as the template for its smaller OnePlus Watch 3.</li><li>This watch should mirror the Watch 3 performance and sensors, but with a 1.32-inch display.</li><li>We also fear it should have a higher-than-average price due to tariffs.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>OnePlus only just launched its Watch 3 in the U.S., and now it appears it'll waste no time launching a smaller model based on the Oppo Watch X2 Mini.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-watch-43mm-fcc-certification/">91Mobiles</a> spotted an FCC certification for a 43mm OnePlus Watch with the model number OPWE242. It measures 48.03 x 43.14mm, which is taller but slimmer than the 46.6 x 47.6mm <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, and will have a 345mAh capacity. The FCC figures also show the rotating crown.</p><p>The Oppo Watch X2 Mini was announced last week with the exact same 345mAh capacity and an estimated 3-day battery life. It sports a 1.32-inch AMOLED display with 60Hz refresh rate and 2,200 nits of brightness.</p><p>Aside from the larger 1.5-inch display and 631mAh capacity, the 47mm Watch 3 and this Oppo watch have identical Snapdragon W5 and BES2800 MCU chips, 2GB/32GB memory, health sensors, IP68 resistance, and display quality.</p><p>That's why it's fair to assume that this 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 will match the Watch X2 Mini specs — though the U.S. version isn't likely to share its eSIM support.</p>

<p>In fact, X leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/yabhishekhd/status/1910361558842028328">Abhishek Yadav</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/health-fitness/smartwatches/oneplus-watch-3-mini-could-be-a-43mm-smartwatch-but-wild-tariff-inflation-could-dampen-its-appeal">Techradar</a>) suggested last week that the "Oppo Watch X2 Mini will launch as a rebadged OnePlus Watch 3 Mini in India and globally."</p><p>Earlier this year, Dr. Leo Zhang, OnePlus's head of R&D for Health, promised that they were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-promises-to-fix-two-key-watch-3-downsides-this-year">"working on" a smaller OnePlus Watch 3</a> because the current version "remains heavy for a small wrist." But we weren't expecting OnePlus and Oppo to deliver this mini-watch so quickly.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/oppo_watch_x2_mini-13787.php">GSMArena</a> reports that the Oppo Watch X2 Mini will weigh 37.8g without the 18mm strap, while the Watch 3 weighs 49.7g and uses a 22mm strap. The weight difference should be significant.</p>

<p>We don't know if this 43mm model will be called "OnePlus Watch 3 Mini" or if the "OnePlus Watch 3" will simply come in two sizes. It's also possible it could be called the OnePlus Watch 3R, as the successor to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>.</p><p>Whatever it's called, this model isn't actually that "mini" — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7 40mm</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3">Pixel Watch 3 41mm</a> weigh 7–9g less — but it uses that extra weight for about 40mAh of extra capacity. Samsung and Google's watches are rated to last 1–2 days; we're excited to see if this new OnePlus Watch 3 can truly last three days on Wear OS.</p><p>At 345mAh, this watch has 286mAh less capacity than the 47mm Watch 3 model, which lasts five days. If OnePlus successfully delivers three days in a smaller package, it'll pressure other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> brands to deliver better battery life, too.</p><p>Truly, the only question is price. The Oppo model costs CNY 1,799, or about $249 converted. But <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">OnePlus bumped its Watch 3 price from $330 to $500</a> without explanation. Tariff concerns are the most likely reason, whether or not Chinese smartwatches are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/donald-trump-exempts-phones-chips-from-new-tariffs">exempted from tariffs</a>.</p><p>If this watch gets its own 50% price boost, it would put the 43mm OnePlus Watch 3 at about $375, which is pricey but not too far from the $350 Pixel Watch 3. If the price creeps any higher, it could impact how many people choose to buy one, even if it's one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android smartwatches</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is supposedly working on another expansion of Gemini's capabilities on Android, which might look familiar.</p><p>In an APK teardown of a recent Google app version, tipster AssembleDebug and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-gemini-scheduled-actions-apk-teardown-3544727/">Android Authority</a> located the early stages of "Scheduled Actions." The feature was working properly; however, the tipster was able to unearth the basics of Scheduled Actions, which seems to focus on automated tasks. The code mentions "cards," which likely refers to what users will see when setting up a task for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to complete.</p><p>Within that comes a little more understanding, like "List of scheduled actions," "Completed," and "Paused."</p><p>Aside from barebones code, the tipster found that Google's early development is placing access to Scheduled Actions in your Account management page. The feature is listed alongside other "More from Gemini" choices. For now, the feature appears blank, only stating the cards for what you've scheduled will "appear here."</p>
<h2 id="where-google-might-go-2">Where Google might go</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX" name="ask-gemini-samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-3" alt="Ask Gemini prompt on Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7LqxohqmsJjLRxM4pqNaUX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gemini's Scheduled Actions are still shrouded in uncertainty, but there are a couple of directions this could go: the Tasks route or the ChatGPT way. If it's the former, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-dedicated-website-goes-live">then it's a little simple</a>. Tasks have remained a core way for Android users (if desired) to keep a reliable reminder of what needs to get done. Users can set the time, date, and a description for the tasks. Additionally, there's its cadence, whether it repeats or not.</p><p>It might seem odd if Google goes in this direction, considering users can link their Tasks app to Gemini and work it that way.</p><p>The publication speculates the company could be developing a ChatGPT-inspired feature that resembles its "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-scheduled-tasks-beta-rollout">Scheduled Tasks</a>." This entered beta in January, which gave testers a chance to leverage the AI's capabilities for reminders and more interesting tasks. ChatGPT could search the internet for news, summarize it, and deliver it to you at a specific time every day.</p><p>During the beta, OpenAI said the feature uses GPT-4o, which limits it to 10 tasks at a time. There's a chance — given the similar name — that Google is looking to move in on OpenAI's experimental feature (after OpenAI did it to Tasks). Regardless, it's still pretty early, so things could always change on Gemini's side.</p>

<hr>
<p>Joining Google's slew of April System updates is a security feature for Android devices that remain locked for a prolonged time.</p><p>The company recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">updated the April portion</a> of its Play Services update changelog, which mentions a new security/privacy update for Android (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/android-auto-restart-security/">9to5Google</a>). Google says the update, specifically for phones, brings an "automatic restart" function for devices that have remained locked for "three consecutive days." More importantly, the update's changelog lacks the specifics for this feature.</p><p>It seems this feature should arrive for the majority of Android devices, but time will tell as it slowly rolls out.</p><p>The publication dives deeper, stating this automatic reboot after three days will return the device to a BFU state, otherwise known as Before First Unlock. Designed to bolster your security, the BFU state encrypts your information. This state is also what many users experience when restarting their device manually and seeing "Unlock for all features" on the lock screen.</p><p>Rolling out with v25.14 of Play Services, Google says this security feature is joined by a few phone utility updates. Users are in for improvements to the data transfer experience when setting up a new device and general bug fixes. Current speculation suggests v25.14 will hit Android devices in the next couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Google's initial batch of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-releases-april-2025-android-system-updates-with-battery-life-improvements">April Play Store and Services updates</a> landed last week for Android phones, TV, Wear, and more. A highlight of that update was the battery improvements the company rolled out for the majority of Android devices, this includes PCs and Wear OS devices, as well as phones. While these may see a little more life battery-wise, the patch refined connectivity across Android devices for more stability.</p><p>Google rolled out a small update for its "Ask a question" feature in the Play Store, enabling it to provide information for videos.</p><p>Last week also held the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">April 2025 security update</a> for Pixels. Google was once again looking to fix a few lingering camera issues Pixel owners have reported for the 6 and 7 series. What's more, April's patch finally fixes a brightness drop/fluctuation issue <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-owners-report-march-security-patch-problems">many Pixel owners suffered</a> following the March feature drop.</p><p>Following the major update, users attempting to view content on streaming services (Netflix, Prime Video, etc.) reported their Pixel's screen would dim and brighten on its own at strange intervals. With the patch slowly making its rounds, those affected should soon find relief.</p>

<hr>
<p>Google is expanding access to its "photorealistic" video generator, Veo 2, today (Apr. 15) for Gemini users and Whisk testers.</p><p>Powered by Google's Veo 2 video generation model, its press release states its abilities are now arriving for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-is-gemini-advanced-worth-buying">Gemini Advanced</a> users globally. The company touts its AI model's ability to "translate text-based prompts into dynamic videos." Integrating with Gemini, Google says users can create videos ranging from short stories to visual concepts and "specific scenes." The feature relies heavily on the user's description, so those getting involved are encouraged to be as detailed as possible with Veo 2.</p><p>As it hits Gemini Advanced, users can select Veo 2's capabilities in the drop-down menu. After inputting your text description, the model will create a short, eight-second clip. The file will be provided in MP4 format with a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p><p>Users can take their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-veo-2-becomes-widely-available-as-it-teases-gemini-2-5-flash">Veo 2</a> generated videos and share them. For mobile, Google directs users to the new "Share" button, which will let you upload your eight-second clip to YouTube Shorts and TikTok.</p><p>As this rolls out for Gemini Advanced users, Google states it's taking the safety of this video generator seriously and will continue to listen to user feedback. More importantly, safeguards are in place to ensure users cannot generate content that violates its policies. All videos generated in Veo 2 are marked with SynthID, giving awareness to all others that the content shown has been AI-generated.</p><p>Gemini Advanced users will also find a "monthly limit" on the number of videos you can have Veo 2 create. While the magic number wasn't stated, Google says Gemini will let you know when you're approaching your limit.</p>

<p>Veo 2 is also arriving in Google's current AI experiment, Whisk. The model's arrival introduces "Whisk Animate," to help users better visualize their ideas through AI generation. While Whisk testers are used to working with images, Google's Veo 2 update lets you take those photos and give them life — if life was an eight-second clip. Users should find vivid and bold colors in these short clips.</p><p>Whisk Animate, courtesy of Veo 2 is rolling out today (Apr. 15). Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google/fx/tools/whisk">give it a try</a>; however, it is restricted to global  Google One AI Premium subscribers.</p><p>Last December, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-whisk-image-video-generation-updates">the company introduced</a> new updates for its Veo 2 and Imagen 3 models. That announcement also held the grand introduction of Whisk, an experimental AI test for Labs users. The model's tagline is "Prompt less, Play More," which is highlighted by Whisk's ability to opt to forgo text descriptions by providing images to fit its three requirements: subject, scene, and style.</p><p>Whisk will "consider" everything in those images to create a brand-new product for whatever you have in mind. At the time, Google highlighted that its AI could get crucial details wrong, like hair, skin tone, and the like. However, Whisk contains a "Review & Edit" button that users can utilize to push the AI to get things right.</p>

The camera housing, whether a full bar on older Pixels or the newer oval shape, is immediately recognizable. That's why when Google ditched the iconic camera bar on the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>, it made waves. Some people love the move, but many more seem to hate it.</p><p>The company originally gave Android Central a few reasons it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/why-google-pixel-9a-ditched-camera-bar">decided to make the Pixel 9a nearly flat</a> at the camera bar's expense. Improved thermal performance, a larger batter capacity, and the need to give the Pixel 9a its own personality were at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Now, Google has more to say on the change in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-9a-new-design-camera/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p>"We wanted to have a physical interpretation that would match the personality of the device," said Soniya Jobanputra, a Pixel product manager.</p><p>Contrary to what you might think after seeing the Pixel 9a online or in photos, the camera bump isn't flush — it's referred to as a "dome" by the company. The design is said to mimic a water droplet, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> design. However, industrial designer Yomi Matsuoka notes that "if you put a case on it, there’s no bump at all."</p>

<p>It turns out that the Pixel 9a wasn't guaranteed to ditch the camera bar, or the more recent camera oval. It tested a few of them in experiments that "focused on [the camera bump's] overall form and appearance as well as certain shapes’ ability to withstand drops and impact." Eventually, the company settled on the Pixel 9a camera bump design we have today.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5" name="Google-Pixel-9a-Iris-2" alt="The Google Pixel 9a in Iris on a rock fixture." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/asxeqoV8jCKM9gVDtwZwx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>People aren't thrilled with the Pixel 9a's design, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/1iz9bnd/thoughts_on_the_pixel_9a/">multiple social media posts</a>. One user described their take on the phone, saying it "kinda looks like a colored brick with a weird camera shape." As someone with a Pixel 9a review unit, I'm qualified to say that take isn't exactly wrong. What's unusual about the public reception to the Pixel 9a's design is that Google seemingly gave customers exactly what they asked for.</p><p>The idea of removing the camera bump in favor of adding more battery has been around seemingly since the dawn of smartphones. More specifically, since phones universally accepted the idea of non-removal batteries and large camera bumps protruding from their rear casing. If you don't believe me, one Redditor pondered whether phones should just get thicker instead of sporting camera bumps six years ago on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/cbwbd1/more_battery_instead_of_camera_bump/" target="_blank">Google Pixel subreddit</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones/comments/cbwbd1/more_battery_instead_of_camera_bump">More battery instead of camera bump?</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pixel_phones">r/pixel_phones</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>This specific thread isn't an outlier, either. Multiple times per year, the concept of making phones thicker to incorporate more features and longer battery life trends on social media.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2836px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.67%;"><img id="tPuTm2zgQ34TyPkVZ7jXib" name="Google-Thicker-Phone-Searches" alt="Reddit threads about people wanting thicker phones." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tPuTm2zgQ34TyPkVZ7jXib.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2836" height="1210" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This time, Google actually listened. It made the Pixel 9a thicker, added more battery life, and swapped out camera sensors. The phone measures 8.9mm, has a giant 5,100mAh battery, and has an almost-flat design. On paper, the Pixel 9a — with multi-day battery life <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/i-spent-weeks-with-the-google-pixel-9a-and-the-pixel-9-you-should-buy-this-one">and a utilitarian design</a> — should've impressed enthusiasts who have been clamoring for this kind of thing for the better part of a decade.</p><p>The takeaway here isn't that the Pixel 9a design is perfect, because it's absolutely not perfect. It's boring and lacks the character that made Pixel phones popular in the first place. However, the design satisfies a long list of requests by smartphone buyers made for years, and that proves consumers don't always know that they want.</p>

<p>ESR is a good egg, with a versatile and affordable series of wireless chargers. I was big a fan of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/esr-qi2-car-charger">ESR Qi2 wireless car charger</a> because it was one of the first such accessories designed for Android and iOS users alike.</p><p>Now, ESR has released a similar <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads">wireless charger</a> with the magnetic Qi2 specification onboard. This time, it's a positively tiny charging pad with a built-in USB-C cable. The ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger comes in black and white and usually retails for $19.99, but you can grab it on sale for just $16.99 or less pretty often.</p>

<h2 id="all-the-right-specs-2">All the right specs</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4096px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="siHWeac3o9FwNBLfcLHsc3" name="ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger" alt="ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/siHWeac3o9FwNBLfcLHsc3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4096" height="2304" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>ESR's HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger has all the perfect specs you'd want from any wireless charging pad. It's ideal for a household that has Android and iOS devices that support wireless charging. Since Qi2 is based on MagSafe, you don't have to worry about cross-platform support of this feature either.</p><p>The built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">USB Type-C cable</a> is of the nylon braided variety. Mearing a lengthy 5-foot long, it's a super-durable cable that's going to withstand the test of time. Nylon-braided cables snag less, and they are less likely to break even if you have bets nibbling on them.</p><p>In fact, ESR guarantees up to 6,000 bends unbroken as per their testing.</p>

<p>This is the "mini" version of ESR's regular HaloLock Wireless Charger, which explains why it's so pocket-friendly by design. ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger hardly weighs anything and fits anywhere with ease.</p><p>You get Qi2 15W wireless charging speed on the ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger, making it suitable for phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>.</p><p>The magnets are reinforced to be even stronger than ESR's other magnetic accessories, promising 1,200g of magnetic strength. Magnetism allows the little pad to snap on and off in a jiffy.</p><p>The little clip-shaped kickstand on the back makes full use of this magnetic power. It's like having a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phones">MagSafe stand for your phone</a> latch on and off whenever you need it, so you can continue binge-watching your favorite YouTuber or Netflix shows as your device charges wirelessly and stays propped up.</p>
<hr>
<p>Between all the cheap wireless chargers available on Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers, it can be intimidating to settle on a single one. You don't really need anything more powerful than this 15W Qi2 charging pad.</p><p>Not to mention, the price is a big draw here too. The ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger is always going on sale too, sweetening the deal further.</p><p>If you're on the hunt for an affordable wireless charger that performs satisfactorily with both Android and iOS ecosystems, this is the perfect thing to buy.</p>

<hr>
<p>Vivo has confirmed that it is launching the X200 Ultra on April 21. As expected, the company's big 2025 flagship is built to impress, packing some serious photo firepower, including a wild 200MP periscope telephoto lens and an extra 200mm super-zoom to back it up.</p><p>Vivo announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/1809745371/Pm7tXsT57" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that it is bringing a whole lineup of new devices, including the X200s, X200 Ultra, Pad 5 Pro, Pad SE, and the new Watch 5 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Official-Vivo-X200-Ultra-launch-date-confirmed-alongside-first-press-photo.994298.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). These new launches will join the Vivo X200 squad from last October, which already includes the X200, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">X200 Pro</a>, and the compact Pro Mini.</p><p>Just like the rumors said, the X200 Ultra is packing Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite chip. On top of that, Vivo is throwing in its own custom VS1 and V3+ chips to handle all the behind-the-scenes magic for photos and videos.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:529px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:55.20%;"><img id="MAvXTb6VBLRwtk5qHFf3Gf" name="Vivo-X200-Ultra-camera" alt="Vivo X200 Ultra camera bump" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MAvXTb6VBLRwtk5qHFf3Gf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="529" height="292" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Vivo / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="screen-game-strong-2">Screen game strong</h2>
<p>Up front, the X200 Ultra sports a 2K Zeiss Master Color display with circular polarized light tech. Vivo says it’s built to be easier on the eyes, especially for long screen time. The brand hasn't spilled the exact screen size yet, but rumor has it we’re looking at a 6.82-inch panel.</p><p>The Vivo X200 Ultra is packing the same 200MP Samsung HP9 periscope cam from the X100 Ultra, but this time with a wider aperture for better low-light shots. It’s also geared up for crisp 4K video at 120fps, thanks to a duo of dedicated imaging chips doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes.</p>
<h2 id="that-thicc-camera-bump-2">That thicc camera bump</h2>
<p>A recently leaked hands-on video gave us an early peek at the Vivo X200 Ultra, and the camera bump absolutely dwarfs the modest module on the X200s.</p><p>Apparently, Vivo is cramming in two big 1/1.28-inch sensors for the 35mm main and 14mm ultrawide lenses, plus a telephoto lens with next-level low-light skills that’s pushing the limits of what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">camera smartphones</a> can do.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5145127924796589" target="_blank">separate leak</a>, tipster Digital Chat Station dropped some fresh X200 Ultra details on Weibo, including the expected color options. Vivo’s upcoming flagship is said to come in black, bold vine red, and white colorways.</p><p>Vivo itself teased a silver version of the X200 Ultra, showing off a back design with subtle vertical stripes for a bit of extra flair.</p>

The latest delay has to do with a bug that prevented Galaxy S24 users from unlocking their phones. While it looks like the issue was predominantly affecting units in Samsung's home market, the manufacturer paused the global rollout just to be on the safe side. <br><br>It's frustrating that Samsung is continuing to run into issues on the stable One UI 7 build, considering the brand ran a lengthy four-month beta testing program that was meant to iron out these problems. I understand the need to be cautious with these things — particularly if it affects something as basic as unlocking a phone — but Samsung should have done a better job addressing these issues well before it got to the stable release. <br><br>I reached out to Samsung for a statement regarding the delay, and the brand noted that the "rollout schedule is being updated to ensure the best possible experience." In typical Samsung fashion, it didn't answer what caused the delay, when the update might start going out to phones again, and what it is doing to prevent any additional roadblocks.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PsbrZGWp8h36efwhhm6VX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Thankfully, there are no issues on devices where One UI 7 comes pre-installed. The Galaxy S25, S25+, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">S25 Ultra</a>, and A56 debuted with the Android 15-based build, and having used the software on the A56 extensively, I didn't run into any bugs or crashes. It's clear that all the lingering issues have to do with upgrading phones running One UI 6 and older to the latest iteration of the software. <br><br>As to why that's the case, Samsung made considerable changes to One UI 7; as I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-7-review">outlined in my review</a>, the update is packed with new features, including a cleaner visual design, vertical app drawer, split notification pane, overhauled camera interface, better image and video editing features, changes to battery management, security updates, and a suite of new AI additions. <br><br>While Samsung used a point release last year to integrate some of these changes — debuting One UI 6.1.1 down the line — it is bundling all the new features into a single release with One UI 7, and that may have also contributed to the extended beta testing program and incessant delays with the stable rollout.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="udemdt54kCKAfAbBPVCra6" name="Samsung One UI 7" alt="Samsung One UI 7 interface on Galaxy A56" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/udemdt54kCKAfAbBPVCra6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Samsung wouldn't confirm when it would resume rolling out One UI 7 to Galaxy S24 devices globally, nor would it say when users in India might receive the update. While the update started going out to phones in South Korea, U.S., U.K., and select western markets, Samsung India didn't even announce plans to deliver One UI 7 to customers using its flagships in the country yet. <br><br>In a similar vein, there's no telling when Samsung's older mid-range phones might get the update — with global Galaxy S24 units and Z Fold 6 yet to make the switch, it will be a considerable wait before Samsung's 2024 and older devices make the move to One UI 7. While I like the update as such, the constant delays and bugs is reminiscent of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oxygenos-12-oneplus-identity">OxygenOS 12 debacle</a> — albeit with greater consequences.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12">Android 12</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-12l-availability">Android 12L</a> have officially reached end-of-life status, and won't receive any more updates or security patches from Google. The last official security update for Android 12 and 12L was the March 2025 release, as devices running these operating systems did not receive the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-april-security-update-screen-flicker-camera-fixes">latest April 2025 security patch</a>. Now, the company has confirmed that this isn't a fluke, officially ending support for Android 12 and 12L as of March 31, 2025 (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-12-end-of-life-3544499/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Google supports Android operating systems for many years after they have been replaced. Typically, there is a large percentage of devices still running older operating systems, sometimes because they can't be upgraded. In this instance, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share" target="_blank">Statcounter</a> estimates that over 12% of Android devices worldwide are still running either Android 12 or 12L.</p><p>These devices have been receiving the latest patches from the Android Security Bulletin through security patch backports for years, but that support window has now come to an end. This is typical for Google support, as it maintained current security patches for more than three years after Android 12 and 12L officially rolled out.</p>

<p>Regardless, support for Android 12 and 12L ending means that older Android phones will almost certainly be stuck on older security patches, without the latest fixes. The list of phones no longer supported now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-s10-review">Samsung Galaxy S10 series</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pixel-3a-review">Google Pixel 3a series</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/oneplus-7-review">OnePlus 7 series</a>.</p><p>OEMs still have the option of manually backporting security patches on the Android Security Bulletin to their devices, but it remains to be seen if any will do so.</p><p>Without the latest security patches, Android 12 and 12L devices immediately become security risks. To keep these devices in use, users will need to find a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/lineageos-22-1-based-on-android-15-is-already-available-for-over-100-devices">custom Android ROM capable of receiving the latest patches</a>.</p>

<ul><li>9to5Google has spotted code showing how Gemini will work on Wear OS.</li><li>You'll summon Gemini with the side button or the "Hey Google" wake word, just like Assistant.</li><li>Gemini will have a similar Wear OS Tile and settings as Assistant, too.</li><li>Last month, Google announced that Gemini would come soon to smartwatches and other devices.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google will soon bring Gemini support to Wear OS watches, replacing the current Google Assistant. But so far, it's hard to say if Gemini will bring substantial new features or just add a fresh coat of paint to the same Assistant tricks.</p><p>In March, Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">announced its full transition to Gemini</a>: After replacing Assistant on Android phones, it would bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> to tablets, Android Auto, headphones, Nest speakers, Google TV, and (of course) smartwatches, with more details in the "next few months."</p><p>Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/gemini-wear-os-update/">9to5Google</a> has decompiled Google APKs in version 1.18.x of the Assistant app, revealing how Gemini will work compared to Assistant. So far, it looks like a "straightforward app update" rather than a substantial change.</p><p>The site found code strings with the text "Gemini is now on your watch" and "Get started with Gemini: Speak naturally and get more done with a personal AI assistant on your watch."</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="6DFxd4FoARrheoJkr39VzZ" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-3-assistant-response-gemini" alt="A Google Assistant response describing Gemini according to Wikipedia." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6DFxd4FoARrheoJkr39VzZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">It'll be hard to fit these in-depth Gemini answers on a 1.3-inch display! </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Pulling up Gemini will be the same as using Assistant; you'll either use the "Hey Google" wake word or hold down the side button, then use your Wi-Fi connection to send your questions Google's way.</p><p>Likewise, 9to5Google's Abner Li reports that At a Glance, Location and Match Voice settings, and pinned actions in the Wear OS tile are all unchanged with Gemini on Wear OS.</p><p>Gemini will “do things like set alarms and timers, message your contacts, and more,” which are all current Assistant functions.</p><p>There <em>is</em> a new "Gemini can make mistakes" disclaimer, something you typically see when using Gemini on your Android phone. While Assistant usually responds to questions with "According to X" or featured snippets from Google Search, Gemini on Wear OS should use LLM-generated responses.</p><p>It'll be interesting to see if Gemini for Wear OS tries to make its LLM responses more concise to better fit on small displays or stay long-winded for the sake of accuracy and usefulness. We'll also have to see if using Gemini takes any longer to respond than Assistant because of cloud processing, and if this has an effect on battery life.</p><p>But in terms of "commands," it should be more of the same.</p>

<p>Gemini on Wear OS should be fairly limited in terms of new on-device commands like you typically see on phones with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-is-making-gemini-nano-available-for-all-android-apps">Gemini Nano</a>.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a> has a Tensor G4 flagship chip, but its on-device AI is restricted because Google "only" had 8GB of RAM to work with. Compare that to a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> with 2GB of RAM and years-old Arm Cortex cores, and it's clear why Gemini on Wear OS wouldn't magically outperform Assistant's capabilities with a name change.</p><p>It's possible that we'll see better communication between your Pixel Watch and other apps via Gemini extensions, but I don't know if we'll get true Gemini Live-style conversations on a watch anytime soon — at least not without killing the battery.</p><p>We can <em>hope</em> at least that we'll see better Gemini tricks on future Pixel Watch hardware, since we're fairly certain Qualcomm will make a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Wear OS chip</a> this year with "more on-device AI capability."</p><p>But for now, Google needs to prioritize making Gemini work on current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">Android watches</a> with limited hardware, before it tries to surprise us with unique AI smarts on the Pixel Watch 4 with Wear OS 6.</p>

<ul><li>Android 15 now requires 32GB of onboard storage, enforcing this requirement by leveraging GMS licensing.</li><li>Technically, phones with less than 32GB of storage can still run AOSP builds of Android 15.</li><li>Phones with 3GB of memory or fewer are now required to use Android Go Edition.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Android's base-level system requirements are quite low compared to the premium capabilities of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">best phones</a> on the market. However, they do increase from time to time, and Android 15 includes new storage and tweaked RAM requirements for devices. As discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-15-minimum-storage-requirement-3543169/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, Google now requires devices to ship with 32GB of storage to run (or upgrade to) <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>.</p><p>The increased requirement has to do with increasing sizes of Android OS updates, as well as individual app sizes. By the time you install Android on a phone with 16GB of RAM and download a few apps, you're out of storage. As such, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> is the last version that can run on low-end devices with only 16GB of storage. While uncommon, Android phones with 16GB of storage do exist, particularly on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">ultra-budget phones with expandable storage</a>.</p><p>As always, the new 32GB requirement must have 75% of its total capacity allocated to the main Android data partition, which includes the OS itself plus apps and files. Technically, budget Android phones can run Android 15 with less than 32GB of storage using the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).</p><p>With that being said, critical Google services — like GMS — can be withheld from devices that don't comply with these requirements, severely impacting usability. For instance, a Google Mobile Services license is required to offer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-services">Google Play Services</a>, and crucially, the Google Play Store for apps.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="zkdoggnQWXa33EDViG7YSK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review-4" alt="Android 15 logo on the Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zkdoggnQWXa33EDViG7YSK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The 32GB requirement for Android 15 is up from 16GB for Android 14. It's the first time Google has raised Android system requirements since Android 13, which was the first to require 16GB. Before that, Android 12 only needed 8GB to run. All of these versions necessitated that 75% of the capacity be allocated to the main data partition.</p><p>Aside from the new storage requirements, Vulkan 1.3 graphics is required for chipsets running Android 15. The same goes for ANGLE libraries, unless the device is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-go">Android Go Edition</a> — a version of Android specifically optimized for lower-end hardware. This comes as Google recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16s-vulkan-standard-is-great-but-adpf-might-be-the-real-miracle">made Vulkan the official graphics API for Android</a>.</p><p>The changes also require devices with 3GB of memory or less to use Android Go Edition, up from 2GB. The baseline requirement of 2GB memory for GMS licensing is unchanged.</p><p>Starting with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-16">Android 16</a>, ANGLE libraries must be enabled by default on devices. It's unclear whether the next version of Android will include any other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/when-will-my-phone-get-android-16">new hardware requirements</a>.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Legendary director James Cameron had a transformative, heavenly experience when he put on a Quest headset to watch VR films. And based on behind-the-scenes demos with unreleased Meta Quest headsets that he "can't talk about," he thinks things will get even more exciting in the "next few years."</p><p>The question is whether the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Meta Quest 4</a> can truly become the next home for Hollywood directors, as Cameron hopes.</p><p>On the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/qOdjM14QW0s">Boz to the Future podcast</a>, Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth interviewed Cameron, whose company, Lightstorm Vision, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/james-cameron-lightstorm-vision-partnership/">partnered with Meta</a> to make "world-class 3D entertainment experiences spanning live sports and concerts, feature films, and TV series featuring big-name IP on Meta Quest."</p><p>The episode ranges from the benefits of AI for VFX to a technical history of filmmaking, but Cameron also spoke at length about why VR is the definitive way to experience his films — and tried to talk about mysterious future Quests before Boz stopped him.</p>
<div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOdjM14QW0s?start=1395" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>
<p>"Brightness is a big deal in theaters," Cameron explains, but he finds it "heartbreaking" that "99% of theaters" don't capture the calibrated color and dynamic range that he wants, so his films look "dim and dull."</p><p>But with a Quest 3 or any other XR headset, because they create a "discrete left-eye right-eye image," you immediately get a brighter, curated experience. The headset's subjective scale and FoV lets you "feel like you're in a theater," but without the downsides.</p><p>"A door opened for me," Cameron said about his first next-gen headset experience. "It was like the heavens parted, light shone down. There was an angel choir singing. It's like, 'ah'! This is how people can see the movie the way I created it to be seen!"</p>

<p>Cameron said he was looking at "some Avatar 3 material" on a headset that morning, and thought, "Wow, this looks great. This looks at least as good as Dolby Laser Vision Cinema, which is the <em>ne plus ultra</em> in an actual group theater."</p><p>At the end of the talk, Cameron discussed how big streamers like Netflix spent huge money on big filmmakers, then refused to greenlight their films to focus on uncreative procedural shows. So he hopes that the "HMD world" will attract filmmakers away from streaming platforms.</p><p>3D VR filmmaking could "blow open over the next few years with some of the new devices you've shared with me," Cameron told Bosworth. He asked if he could "talk about" these mystery Quest prototypes, but when Boz shut that down, Cameron simply said, "It's going to be very f***ing cool."</p><p>"We hope to build a bigger audience that reinvigorates people's willingness to invest" in VR filmmaking, Bosworth responded.</p><p>The filmmaker concluded the podcast by suggesting listeners "follow Meta for the next couple years," and that everything (aside from Avatar 3) that Cameron is doing is related to Meta because "I'm a 3D guy and [Meta is] the best channel."</p>

<p>In the early days of the VR renaissance, the Tribeca Film Festival had a Virtual Arcade where Hollywood filmmakers streamed 3D films on Oculus Rifts. I attended every year, interviewing Hollywood producers about why VR filmmaking had so much untapped potential compared to traditional films.</p><p>I saw <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/here-be-dragons-tribeca-the-protectors-7776">Hillary Clinton speak to Kathryn Bigelow</a> about her VR anti-poaching documentary, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/bourne-identity-director-takes-on-vr-with-new-film-invisible">spoke to Bourne director Doug Liman</a> about his VR TV series, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.wareable.com/vr/best-vr-films-games-tribeca-film-festival-2018">spoke to Her Story creator Sam Barlow</a> about merging games and films through the VR medium. It was an exciting time, when VR films and games felt equally important.</p><p>While VR filmmaking still exists, the interest (and funding) has faded. Big brands like Google and Oculus (later Meta) shut down their in-house studios, and most directors left VR behind as a fad while Quest primarily became a space for gaming and fitness.</p><p>There's a reason why Boz said they need to "reinvigorate people's willingness to invest" in VR films. They're still made today, but they're often niche, free tie-in experiences for other content — not a space for long-form content where you can earn your money back.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2933px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="GAbK3utmxRfZQdzveGxwHU" name="The-peoples-house-vr-film" alt="A still of VR film "The People's House" showing former president Obama giving a tour of the White House." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GAbK3utmxRfZQdzveGxwHU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2933" height="1650" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">This VR documentary had former president Obama giving a tour of the White House's West Wing and private residences.

<p>Today, you can watch 3D movies on Apple Vision Pro — like Cameron's Avatar — but there's a difference between an extra dimension on 2D films and films shot with 180º or 360º cameras that immerse you in a space and let you choose where to look.</p><p>I suspect Cameron's Meta work will also focus more on stereoscopic 3D content rather than spatial content, but I'm happy to be proven wrong. If you haven't watched true VR films before, believe me when I say that the most powerful ones will stay in your brain years later, as well as you might remember going somewhere in real life.</p><p>But will other Hollywood directors follow suit? It all depends on whether or not the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-4">Quest 4</a> really is so "f***ing cool" that it becomes more popular for streaming, not just gaming.</p>

<p>At GDC 2025, Meta's head of game publishing Chris Pruett talked about how Meta's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/gdc-2025-oculus-publishing-head-challenges-meta-criticism-on-quest-store-profitability">target audience has shifted</a> from elite gamers to teens who love meme games like Gorilla Tag. But they now believe that "mainstream adults," or "30-something dads," will be the next "major player" on Quest headsets in 2026 and 2027.</p><p>To target this demographic, they want to make the next Quest headset a "really high-end TV" for non-gamers to use as a TV replacement. So I suspected at the time that the Quest 4 would get a major resolution boost, closer to what the Apple Vision Pro offers.</p><p><em>This</em> is probably what Cameron wanted to talk about. Meta let him try a future headset prototype with good-enough resolution for high-res, 3D films, and Cameron wants to port his next 3D films a few inches from your eyes with the brightness and clarity that you don't always get in a theater.</p><p>And this explains why Meta wants to invest in this partnership now. Making films and TV shows takes time, especially 3D ones! If it wants to have content for the Quest 4 in a couple of years, it makes sense that they'd start now.</p><p>I don't know if Cameron will be able to convince any of his Hollywood peers to jump on the VR train. But his presence alone has me excited for what kind of immersive 3D films we'll see on Quest headsets in the future.</p>

<p><em><strong>Sarah asks:</strong></em></p><p><em><strong>I just bought a new Samsung and it already has apps for mail, calendar, contacts, and other things installed. Is it OK to use these or should I install Google's versions from the app store? </strong></em></p>
<p>Hi Sarah! Congrats on the new phone. It's always fun using one once the setting-up part is over, and it sounds like you're going through that part right now. I think this is the very worst part of buying a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">new Android phone</a>, and having a bunch of apps preinstalled is part of the reason why. Phone makers really need to "borrow" Apple's way of making a full backup, which you can restore if you want to.</p><p>Anyhoo, the quick answer to your question is that it's perfectly fine to use the apps that are already there, though some of them <em>might</em> be worth changing. Let's dive a little deeper to learn why I think this way.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4004px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="i7E3q4FJcfqW2HYVLwYG4S" name="Google-Messages-Voice-Message-Transcript.jpg" alt="A Voice Message Transcript on Google Messages" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i7E3q4FJcfqW2HYVLwYG4S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4004" height="2252" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first thing to know is that companies like Samsung use tools built into Android to connect apps to your Google account, the same as Google's various app development teams do. Apps like contacts or calendar tie into Google's cloud, where everything is stored, and they connect automatically once you've set them up.</p><p>The real differences are in the UI (user interface). Some companies add a bit of extra flourish to the look with colors or icons, and you might even find different features between different companies' apps. And that can make a big difference.</p><p>It's also worth noting that some of those apps are actually from Google because they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-gms-and-why-does-my-phone-need-it">must be pre-installed on every "official" Android-powered phone</a>. Apps like Photos or Chrome are from Google, no matter which company made your phone.</p>
<p>With all that said, there are three apps from Google you should install or keep installed:</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-google-chrome-tips-and-tricks"><strong>Google Chrome</strong></a> is not the best browser for your Android phone but there are times when you need to use it because so many websites on the internet are specifically made to run best in Chrome. Other browsers share the same base as Chrome (called Chromium), be still, stuff gets broken sometimes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-messages-will-soon-use-color-to-differentiate-rcs-and-sms-mms-users"><strong>Google Messages</strong></a> may not have all the features you'll find in a messaging app from another company, but it gets updates to Android's messaging platform as soon as they are ready. I would suggest you use this for text messaging with people who aren't using something like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-is-letting-you-chat-with-your-pictures-thanks-to-gemini"><strong>Google Photos</strong></a> is a must-have for everyone with an Android phone. The interface is kind of confusing and goofy, but keeping a cloud backup of everything you thought was important enough to take a picture of is awesome. Make sure you set it up to do it, even if you use a different app to look at things on your phone itself.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/gemini-gains-more-google-assistant-features"><strong>Google Gemini/Assistant</strong></a> is simply better than anything from the company that made your phone, no matter which company that is. If you want to use AI stuff, take the time to get it set up.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="y8WW6c4nL6HjxMyYbqix43" name="Samsung-Internet-hero.jpg" alt="Samsung Internet welcome screen on mobile" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y8WW6c4nL6HjxMyYbqix43.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are some other apps that you might want to use that don't come from Google, too. Some don't really matter; use whichever contacts and calendar app you like, for example, because they all do the same thing, even though they may look and feel a little different.</p><p><strong>Use another internet browser</strong>. You mentioned you bought a Samsung, so using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-internet-browser-app-update-to-bring-gestures">Samsung's web browser</a> is a fine idea. You get the benefit of extensions, a better UI, and more features and tools. You still have Chrome to fall back on if things seem like they are broken, but a third-party browser can offer a much better experience most of the time.</p><p><strong>Use another messenger if you can</strong>. I suggest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp">WhatsApp</a> because it's so popular. There isn't anything wrong with Google Messages, but it's still tied to your phone service, and other apps are much more popular, especially outside of North America. Find out which one most of your friends and family are using and install it.</p><p><strong>Use any file browser not made by Google</strong>. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/files-by-google-smart-search-features">Google's all suck</a>, there's no gentle way to say it. Some are more advanced than others, but I find Samsung's to be fine, and it should already be installed.</p><p><strong>Spotify/Apple Music/Tidal</strong> or another online music service might be worth looking into. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music-bad-product-desperate-need-improvement">YouTube Music</a> works fine, but the UI is a mess, and the discovery feeds are garbage sometimes.</p>
<p>You'll see lots of recommendations from other folks online, and it's often worth checking them out. Some are for more advanced users, like manual camera apps, while others offer a great experience for casual users. Most of them are free, so check the permissions, install them, and give them a go — you can always uninstall them later.</p><p>Half the fun of having a smartphone is finding cool new things you can do with it, so never be afraid to experiment!</p>

<hr>
<p>Following Google's recent AI test, the company is reportedly working on an improved Search bar to help users get involved.</p><p>Found in the main Google app by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/google-ai-mode-search-bar/">9to5Google</a>, the company is seemingly working on bringing a dedicated AI Mode button within the Search bar. The button (a magnifying glass) will be encased in a ring of Google's classic assortment of colors. This option is held completely separate from the app's primary Search function, the bar itself.</p><p>Tapping the icon produces a separate menu from the Search bar. Typially, users are taken to a list of "trending searches" on Google, as well as the ability to search what they want. However, for AI Mode, users tapping this new button will receive a short sub-menu with the feature's writing field.</p><p>Inside the field, at the bottom, users will find options to attach an image or to take a photo.</p><p>The company is also giving users a look at a few suggested actions that it can provide insight for. Due to AI Mode's entrance in the Search bar, the publication notes that the Lens and voice icons have disappeared. Google has seemingly placed them beneath the Search bar, which means the other buttons for the Translator and more have been moved elsewhere.</p>

<p>Nothing is for sure with this slight change, as it seems Google is testing this new location. It's also not quite as widespread.</p><p>Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tests-experimental-ai-mode">AI Mode</a> is a relatively new feature that debuted in early March. The feature is designed to feel like AI Overviews 2.0. At its core, the company stated AI Mode will seek to assist users with understanding "complex topics" by producing results that incorporate highly advanced reasoning and thinking. AI Mode is also said to deliver answers to more nuanced questions "in one go," rather than forcing users to dig through additional search results.</p><p>A short demonstration showed how AI Mode can answer a question briefly, giving appropriate links, while also going deeper with longer explanations.</p><p>The mode shortly arrived in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-mode-is-now-giving-early-access-to-select-users">early access for select users</a> a couple of days after. Meanwhile, Google also announced that it would integrate Gemini into AI Mode, bringing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/googles-ai-mode-gets-geminis-multimodal-powers">multimodal capabilities</a> to this new feature. Simply put, Google said this upgrade will ensure AI Mode can deliver comprehensive answers to complex questions in one go.</p>

<ul><li>The OnePlus 13T has leaked yet again, this time revealing the rear design of the small flagship.</li><li>Unlike other OnePlus phones, the OnePlus 13T appears to have a squircle camera housing positioned asymmetrically.</li><li>The phone also supposedly has excellent 50/50 weight balance.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13T, a smaller and more compact version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a>, is set to arrive later this month. Official teasers and unofficial leaks are rolling in, with the latest one coming from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/6048569942/PnbS6in4F" target="_blank">Digital Chat Station on Weibo</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/oneplus-13t-design-balance-leak/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>). The reputable leaker shared an image of the OnePlus 13T with a back design that's a departure from the rest of the OnePlus 13 series.</p><p>OnePlus phones, for multiple generations, have sported a large circular rear camera housing centered on the back. With the OnePlus 13T, that's changing. The "mini" phone appears to feature a squircle camera bump on the back with two camera lenses and a flash. It looks most similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold's</a> rear camera bump, which is also a squircle positioned near the topmost left corner.</p><p>The leaked image appears to show a matte finish in a black or space gray-esque colorway. It's officially called "Cloud Ink Black," per Digital Chat Station. However, it's important to note that these finish names are translated to English, so the actual terms may vary. "Morning Mist Gray" and "Heartbeat Pink" are also tipped to be available as OnePlus 13T colorways.</p>

<p>The OnePlus 13T has been officially teased for weeks now, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-teases-its-upcoming-13t-as-a-part-of-an-april-fools-prank">a major reveal happening on April Fool's Day</a>. It is set to launch later this month, according to leaks, but availability and pricing is unclear. With the ongoing tariff situation in the U.S., which shockingly drove up the price of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, there's more uncertainty than usual.</p>

It works like this: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/google-pixel-9a/"><strong>buy the phone and add a line with the Unlimited Welcome, Unlimited Plus, or Unlimited Ultimate plan and you'll get $499.99 in promo credits over 36 months</strong></a>.

<p>After being delayed for a few weeks because of a "component quality issue", the Google Pixel 9a was finally released on April 10th with considerably less fanfare than you'd expect from a mainstream device launch. Still, the rollout may have been disappointing, but the device itself is not, coming complete with an outstanding 5,100mAh battery (larger than the regular Pixel 9), Tensor G4 chipset, and vivid 6.3-inch pOLED display. Pair those specs with all the latest Gemini AI features and seven years of software updates and you're looking at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a> that punches well above its weight. </p><p>Unlike some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon deals</a>, this offer is compelling because it doesn't require a trade-in, nor does it force you to sign up for the most expensive data plans to receive the savings. Unlimited Welcome, for instance, is one of Verizon's most affordable options, giving users unlimited talk, text, and data on the carrier's vast 5G network. The plan starts at $65 per month for a single line, but you can drop the price considerably when you add multiple lines (as low as $30 per month for four lines). </p><p>Sure, if you're looking for a trade-in deal or prefer to buy phones unlocked, by all means look elsewhere. But if you're ready to update your wireless service and you're in the market for a new Pixel device, this is one of the best Android deals on the web today. </p>

<ul><li>Rumors of an "early preview" for Samsung's One UI 8 have surfaced, alleging some changes users may see.</li><li>The first involves the potential expansion of One UI 7's Now Brief to older devices, like Samsung's 2024 foldables.</li><li>Other changes involved slight design tweaks to the Gallery and Files Manager apps.</li><li>Rumors claim Samsung has already entered "deep testing" for One UI 8 on the Galaxy S25 as the company tries to keep pace with Google's early Android 16.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Early interest for Samsung's next One UI version mounts as leaks purport feature expansions and redesigns.</p><p>X tipster <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1911737881703358968">Tarun Vats</a> highlighted a few alleged One UI 8 leaks discovered by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.smartprix.com/bytes/samsung-one-ui-8-first-look-android-16-foundation-with-familiar-design-exclusive/">SmartPrix</a>. The publication's supposed "early preview" brought word that One UI 7's Now Brief will "no longer be a Galaxy S25 exclusive," per Vats on X. The post states the "current build" for One UI 8 contains this feature, and it's apparent availability for other "high-end models," like the Galaxy Z Flip 6, Fold 6, and more.</p><p>The snapshots suggest Now Brief will continue to incorporate a range of Samsung's apps for personalized suggestions. The leaked photo shows apps like Smart Home, battery status, YouTube Shorts, and Digital Wellbeing, among others.</p>
<h2 id="slight-reworks-2">Slight Reworks</h2>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">One UI 8 - Gallery First look ‼️ pic.twitter.com/SzzEg8xXxR<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1911736868728693116">April 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Aside from a feature expansion, the publication's supposed hands-on suggests Samsung is working on a few "visual tweaks." For now, these changes were spotted in the Gallery and Files Manager apps. Regarding the former, the early build shows a blurred, transparent design for the Gallery's sub-menu. Additionally, the provided icons are no longer simple icons laid atop a gray background.</p><p>It seems Samsung will give these icons their own bubbles on the top row while giving pill-shaped icons to options like Shared Albums, Clean Out, Trash, and Settings.</p><p>The Files Manager is altering its main view. The post claims users could see its categories stacked in more rectangular boxes instead of square. Moreover, beneath that, Samsung's early test showed a slightly refined "recently added" section. The Files Manager may state how many files you've recently added in a simple carousel for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<p>Interestingly, this isn't the first time we've heard about the Now Brief potentially <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/older-samsung-galaxy-phones-foldables-one-ui-7-now-brief-code-spotted">arriving for older phones and foldables</a>. A tipster discovered remnants of its code available in the One UI 7 beta code for the Galaxy S24, as well as code for the Flip 6 and Fold 6. While there's hope, we need to remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-one-ui-7-ai-hardware-limitations-interview-highlight">Samsung's interview</a> with its EVP and head of Framework R&D, Sally, who said owners of past-gen devices shouldn't expect every One UI 7 feature.</p><p>Aside from that, rumors have claimed Samsung may jump from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-one-ui-8-sooner-after-one-ui-7-rumors">One UI 7 right into One UI 8</a>, considering how much sooner Android 16 is arriving. Those speculations were seemingly bolstered as Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s25-caught-testing-samsungs-upcoming-one-ui-8-android-16-update">was supposedly caught</a> with a One UI 8 test build for the Galaxy S25. Evidence of this build was reportedly spotted on Samsung's internal servers for the latest smartphone.</p><p>Samsung itself <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-beta-team-highlights-one-ui-8-testing-rumors">spoke about this topic</a> in March, saying users shouldn't get too excited. The company stated what users are hearing whispers about likely involve early test builds (which we've seen repeatedly) and only indicate the "early stages" of development. As of now, there's no clue when One UI 8 could arrive; however, Google is planning to rollout Android 16 in Q2 2025.</p>

<hr>
<p>Netflix appears to be finding a few more ways to make its subscribers engaged with the streaming platform as it is going to incorporate a new search strategy, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com./news/articles/2025-04-11/netflix-tests-new-ai-search-engine-to-recommend-shows-movies">Bloomberg reports</a>.</p><p>The streaming giant is currently testing an OpenAI-powered search engine to help users find TV shows and movies by using specific terms, notes Bloomberg. It can also include terms based on the user's current mood, for which they can get recommendations with the use of new search technology.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="N2asewEyu7LkDZ4ieyMZsf" name="Netflix-close-up-TV-logo.jpeg" alt="Netflix app on TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N2asewEyu7LkDZ4ieyMZsf.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>For some iOS devices for users in Australia and New Zealand, the tool is said to be already live for testing, and it is likely to expand to even more markets, including the U.S. “It’s early days for the feature and we’re really in a learn and listen phase for this beta,” Netflix spokesperson MoMo Zhou recently confirmed to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/647518/netflix-openai-search-beta-test-ios">The Verge</a>.</p><p>Currently, Netflix allows users to search by genres, actors' names, year, and the streaming platform has been using AI and machine learning for its recommendations that users already see, which is based on users' watch history and liked content. The new tech appears to be a step up as it adds an extra and more precise layer to already existing search and could give consumers a lot more options on what they want to watch.</p>
<p>Netflix has been on the verge of adding new features for its subscribers for quite some time now. For instance, recently, the platform has added live programming and games, which included the fight between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson, and NFL games during the 2024 Christmas too. The company is expected to add even more this year.</p><p>In other Netflix news early this year, the streaming giant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/netflix-q4-2024-record-revenue-price-hike-report">noted</a> that its Q4, 2024 report has outperformed the previous quarter with the revenue growing by 16% YoY (year over year), the operating income rising by 52% YoY, and by the end of 2024, the company settled with 302 million subscribers.</p>

Why do I think this? Well, let's break it down.</p><p>Here at Android Central, we're constantly gathering all of the most reputable rumors and insider leaks to determine when and if a new device is going to drop, and we have a pretty outstanding track record (if I may say so myself).</p><p>There's also a bit of common sense involved in this case, as Samsung typically hosts two announcement events each year: one in winter and one during the summer months. In other words, if past years are any indication, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a> will arrive in July or August.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="LnM5qCzbhvm9LQNgLsJdBe" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-15.jpg" alt="Back of Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 in-hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LnM5qCzbhvm9LQNgLsJdBe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While nothing is confirmed just yet, months of <strong>rumors and leaks have suggested that we'll get a first look at the Galaxy Z Fold 7 during a Samsung Unpacked event this July</strong>. Similar to past years, we expect the premium foldable phone to be unveiled alongside the clamshell-style Galaxy Z Flip 7 and — most likely — the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8.</p><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 will be following last year's Galaxy Z Fold 6, a powerful yet somewhat underwhelming device that bore a steep starting price of $1,899.99. It's quite likely that the 2025 version of the phone will boast a similar price tag, but early signs suggest that we may enjoy some meaningful upgrades to make up for the investment.</p><p>For example, the new foldable phone is expected to feature the same incredible Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset that powers the Galaxy S25 series, plus we're almost certain to get that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-may-finally-bring-this-much-needed-upgrade-to-the-galaxy-z-fold-7">"creaseless" display showcased during MWC 2025</a>. That's pretty much the ultimate goal for producers of foldable phones, and if Samsung finally pulls it off, it's a big deal.</p><p>Still, a phone that costs nearly $2,000 feels a little out-of-touch in this day and age, and the steep price tags continue to be the biggest barrier to entry for most folks interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phones</a>. Fortunately, Samsung is sure to offer some preorder discounts that will soften the blow once the phone is unveiled.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h3>
<h2 id="when-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-launch-2">When will the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 launch?</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 7 is expected to be announced at a Samsung Unpacked event in July or August. After the initial reveal, it usually takes a couple of weeks before the phone actually hits store shelves. For example, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 was announced on July 10th, 2024, and released on July 24th, while the Z Fold 5 was announced on July 26th, 2023, with an August 11th street date.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-7.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/55ZQmVwWJDrUhztCxVy7Vo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2 id="how-much-will-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-cost-2">How much will the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cost?</h2>
<p>Samsung's Z Fold series is notoriously expensive. 2024's Z Fold 6, for instance, hit store shelves with a whopping starting price of $1,899 for the 256GB version, while the 1TB configuration maxed out at a steep $2,259.</p><p>If I had to guess, I'd expect that the Z Fold 7 will have a starting price of <em>at least</em> $1,899, but the rumored spec boost — which includes upgrades like the Snapdragon 8 Elite and a new creaseless display panel — might raise the price even further. That being said, you never know: the Galaxy S25 series was revealed just a few months ago with the same price tags as its predecessor, which was honestly refreshing for such a high-profile flagship.</p><p>Needless to say, the announcement of the device is sure to be accompanied by a ton of preorder deals, so that should help lessen the blow.</p>
<h2 id="will-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-drop-in-price-2">Will the Galaxy Z Fold 6 drop in price?</h2>
<p>Now that the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is (probably) just around the corner, many Android fans are wondering if it's a good time to buy last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. While it's hard to know for sure, I can say that the Z Fold 6 has been receiving some pretty impressive discounts over the past few months, dropping to as low as $1,119.99 during major sale events. The problem is that Z Fold 6 stock is sure to diminish quickly once the new phone arrives, so playing the waiting game can be a bit risky.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="U7ci7G9gqtLnMu6gFp796X" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-18.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with fountain behind" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U7ci7G9gqtLnMu6gFp796X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Galaxy Z Fold 5 from 2023, for instance, is almost impossible to find new and unlocked at retailers like Amazon today, and the one third-party seller that has the phone in stock as of writing is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Streaming/dp/B0C63H2MDL/"><strong>trying to ditch it for over $1,300.</strong></a> In other words, if you prefer unlocked phones, don't feel like you need to wait for the Z Fold 7 to buy its predecessor.</p><p><strong>What I </strong><em><strong>would </strong></em><strong>do, however, is plan to buy the Galaxy Z Fold 6 during a major sale event, such as Prime Day</strong>. That Amazon sale is likely to come just a week or two before Samsung Unpacked, and it might present the perfect opportunity to purchase the Z Fold 6 before its new sibling arrives.</p><p>Furthermore, if you're able to process a trade-in or upgrade your wireless service, you may want to wait and see what Z Fold 7 preorder deals go live once the phone gets announced. Knowing how Samsung handles its newest devices, I wouldn't be surprised if these early offers put the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-deals">best Galaxy Z Fold 6 deals</a> to shame.</p>

However, the Korean OEM gave us no reason for pausing the firmware's rollout.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-117">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>One UI 7 rollout seizes globally as Samsung tackles a 'serious bug,' according to prominent tipster IceUniverse.</li><li>Samsung hasn't put out an official statement about the matter as yet, but several people have spotted the firmware being pulled out of OTA servers.</li><li>We currently have no information on when the rollout is set to begin again.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung users' happiness knew no bounds as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/stable-one-ui-7-rolls-out-to-users-both-in-the-us-and-european-regions">One UI 7 finally started </a>rolling out last week. But this feeling was very short-lived. The Korean OEM seems to have stalled the rollout of its stable One UI 7, which became available to people in the U.S. only four days ago.</p><p>According to a new leak that surfaced on Sunday (April 13), avid Tipster IceUniverse took to X (prev. Twitter) to give their followers some bad news. In the post, they stated that after the firmware was pushed in Korea on April 10, the company seemed to have identified a "serious bug," which led to the company suspending One UI 7's rollout globally.</p><p>IceUniverse also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1911651452713648568">stated</a> that the bug is causing some Korean Galaxy S24 users to see issues with unlocking their devices once they updated to the new firmware.</p><p>Looks like the One UI 7 Saga continues, this is the first time that Samsung delayed the rollout of its firmware and after pushing out several Beta versions and testing it out for months on end, the firmware finally reached devices in Korea on April 7, and Samsung jotted down a global roll-out program that reached other countries by the end of May.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sudden!After the Korean Galaxy S24 series firmware was pushed, a serious bug was found, which led to the suspension of the push plan in all other countries, including China.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1911616077756580142">April 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>The first ones to see this software update pop up on their phones are those with either the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Galaxy S24 </a>series or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/one-ui-7-finally-gives-the-galaxy-z-fold-6-a-taste-of-that-pixel-fold-trick">Galaxy Z Fold 6 </a>and<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-6-hands-on"> Z Flip 6,</a> much like how the rollout happened in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/samsung-finally-starts-rolling-out-stable-one-ui-7-for-galaxy-s24-series">Korea</a>.</p><p>But now, according to another tipster TarunVats, the firmware build has been nowhere to be seen on OTA servers since this weekend. He also states that Samsung took down the One UI 7 update scheduled for Vietnam from its newsroom web app.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Galaxy Fam!!It's official—the worldwide One UI 7 rollout is paused.The Galaxy S24 series and Z Fold/Flip6 (now US models) have had their updates pulled.

<p>Samsung has yet to put out an official statement on the situation, however, as of now, we have no timeline as to when the One UI 7 will be available for download again. However, according to AC staff who have this build on their phones, they've experienced no issues whatsoever since the update last week. "New expandable widgets, new notification behavior, etc all seem to be fine," said AC's Jeremy Kaplan, who owns a Galaxy S24 Ultra.</p><p>Lastly, other devices that were set to see the One UI 7 build later this month and in May, might see a delay in rollout as well. This includes the Galaxy Z Fold 4/ Flip 4/ 3, Galaxy S23 series, S23 FE, A34, A35, S22/ S21 series, and the Tab S9/S8 series.</p><p>While we have no information on additional issues this bug could be causing, it seems like a major hiccup in the whole firmware rollout process. Android Central has reached out to Samsung about this and we will update this article once we have more information.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-122">What you need to know</h2>

<hr>
<p>Samsung today pulled the wraps off its latest rugged devices: the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro and Tab Active 5 Pro. Built with frontline teams and enterprise use in mind, these rugged devices keep the durability Samsung has been known for, but now with even more power to handle whatever the job throws their way.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro stands out with its tough build, boasting IP68 water and dust resistance, MIL-STD-810H military-grade durability, and Gorilla Glass Victus+ protecting the screen. It’s a solid upgrade over last year’s XCover 7 and officially takes the baton from the XCover 6 Pro that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-xcover-6-pro-announcement">dropped three years ago</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tough-meets-smart-2">Tough meets smart</h2>
<p>Aside from being tough, the XCover 7 Pro is also smart where it counts. Samsung threw in some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> tricks usually reserved for its flagships, like Google's Circle to Search and the Object Eraser.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro levels up with the Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 chip, giving it way more muscle than the regular XCover 7’s Dimensity 6100+. It even edges out the older XCover 6 Pro’s Snapdragon 778G.</p>

<p>It rocks a brighter 6.6-inch display and a 4,350mAh battery. But what really sets it apart is its customization options, going way beyond regular phones. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-rugged-android-phones">rugged phone</a> boasts customizable physical buttons and pogo pin connectors for extra accessories and charging.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro packs a bit more juice, bumping up from 4,050mAh to 4,350mAh. Plus, the battery is removable, making it a great option for long shifts or extended use in the field.</p><p>Don't sleep on the Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro either. The tablet is rocking the same Snapdragon powerhouse as the XCover 7 Pro behind its 10.1-inch screen. But this tablet takes power management even further, thanks to its ability to run without an internal battery when docked. Additionally, you can swap out battery packs without shutting it down.</p>

<p>The Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro brings the same tough design features as the XCover 7 Pro, including an IP68 rating for water and dust resistance. Even the S-Pen stylus gets the same rugged treatment, so it’s ready for whatever harsh environments you throw at it.</p>
<h2 id="sunlight-no-problem-2">Sunlight? No problem</h2>
<p>Both the Galaxy XCover 7 Pro and Tab Active 5 Pro come with Vision Booster, so you can actually see your screen in bright sunlight. The Tab Active 5 Pro kicks it up a notch, pushing the brightness to 600 nits, way up from the 480 nits in the last model.</p><p>When it comes to updates, you're set for the long haul: seven years of OS and security updates. That’s a major upgrade from the usual four OS revisions and five years of security.</p><p>The Galaxy XCover 7 Pro will be available for purchase starting May 8, while Samsung expects the Galaxy Tab Active 5 Pro to drop in early June.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>OPPO is crushing it in 2025; the debut of the Find X8 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">X8 Pro</a> allowed the brand to build decent momentum going into the year, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a> showcased just what's possible with foldables. OPPO is building on that with the introduction of the Find X8 Ultra, its best phone yet. Last year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x7-ultra-review">Find X7 Ultra</a> was one of my favorite phones, and it was only bested by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x100-ultra-long-term-review">Vivo's X100 Ultra</a> when it came to photos and videos, so I was keen on taking a look at what OPPO is doing this year. <br><br>The Find X8 Ultra has a new design that's in line with the standard X8 and X8 Pro, and while the overall aesthetic doesn't quite stand out quite as much as previous years, it's great to hold and use. Thankfully, the phone retains the quartet of 50MP cameras at the back, and you get a 1-inch main sensor that takes outstanding photos and videos. <br><br>There are the usual upgrades in other areas, and I like that the phone has a 6100mAh battery; it lasts longer than just about every other device I tested in 2025, and is on par with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> in this regard. While there's obviously a lot to like, the Find X8 Ultra has the same foibles as its predecessor; the phone is limited to China as of writing, and there are no plans to bring it to global markets.</p>

<p>OPPO unveiled the Find X8 Ultra at a launch event in Xi'An, China, on April 10. I was invited to attend the event, but I wasn't able to go due to a visa rejection (which is incredibly annoying). Anyway, the device is now available in China, where it is sold in three storage configurations: the base 12GB/256GB model costs ¥6,499 CNY ($891), the 16GB/512GB edition is ¥6,999 CNY ($959), and the 16GB/1TB model is ¥7,999 CNY ($1,096). <br><br>The 1TB model is the only one that gets satellite messaging, and as I'm using the 16GB/512GB edition of the device, I wasn't able to test the feature. The Find X8 Ultra was joined by the Find X8s+ and Find X8s, with both devices offering incremental updates to the Find X8 and X8 Pro. <br><br>Annoyingly, the Find X8 Ultra won't be available outside China, and in a statement to Android Central, OPPO said: "The Find X8 Ultra is planned for release only in mainland China. However, many of the technologies featured in this device will be incorporated into future OPPO products, which will be available in more regions."</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-design"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Design</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kZBGdwgaEMJZgBFuZFQu5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO always delivered standout designs with Find X models, but it is taking a conservative approach this time around. The Find X8 Ultra has a similar aesthetic as the X8 and X8 Pro, and it misses out on some of the design flair of previous generations. The Find X7 Ultra was one of the best-looking phones of 2024 thanks to a gorgeous dual-tone leather and glass design, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x6-pro-review">Find X6 Pro</a> also had a distinctive design.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jdHsBUtNV8aHJcvXUFfM5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jdHsBUtNV8aHJcvXUFfM5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the X8 Ultra misses out on some of that flamboyance, it has the same great build quality. Most phones now use flat sides — ostensibly to deliver bigger batteries and increased longevity — and the X8 Ultra is no different. Thankfully, the sides are beveled, and that makes holding and using the device that much more comfortable. Coming in at 226g, it has a good heft and doesn't feel unwieldy in the least, and OPPO did a good job with the weight distribution.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g7rDxYtz3wyG6kqTCndK5F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, it is thinner than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a>, but you don't notice it that much because of the sheer size of the camera island at the back. Like previous years, the oversized camera dominates attention at the back, and the quartet of lenses are arranged symmetrically. I got the white model, and it has a matte texture that's good to hold — all while minimizing smudges.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="VbLRDFXE3NDv7MoKsbrp3F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VbLRDFXE3NDv7MoKsbrp3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The phone is clearly built to last; I didn't use it with a case, and after two weeks of testing and several tumbles, there's no visible damage or scratches whatsoever. You also get IP68 and IP69 ingress protection, and I didn't see any issues using the device in a sauna.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="SxwD6DH2azkB2mzHAC3HAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SxwD6DH2azkB2mzHAC3HAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>OPPO also switched to an ultrasonic module this time, and it is fantastic; it is fast to authenticate and doesn't have any issues even if you use the sensor with wet fingers. The location is ideal — unlike previous years — so I was able to use my thumb to unlock the device without any hassle.</p>
<p>A notable addition is a dedicated button on the right that serves as a shutter button. Pressing it twice launches the camera, and you get to shoot with a single press, with a slide along the button to adjust the zoom level. The button sits flush with the mid-frame, and while it is a decent enough addition, I didn't use it quite as much — just like Camera Control on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="fb8UWDhP3AVUSu8vUUfo3F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fb8UWDhP3AVUSu8vUUfo3F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another new inclusion is the Shortcut Button, with the alert slider making its way to a multifunction button. The feature is identical to the Action Button on an iPhone, and it allows you to toggle DND, launch the flashlight, take notes, memos, and so on. The menu to configure the button is also identical to iOS, and some originality in this area would have been better.</p>

<p>I'm not going to talk about the panel too much, as there isn't much that's new. The Find X8 Ultra uses a similar-sized 6.82-inch AMOLED as previous years, and it has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 and 120Hz dynamic refresh that goes down to 1Hz. The main difference is that the panel is fully flat, and it has uniform bezels of 1.4mm on all sides.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AV99w9fQuHTtWpZT2ibb8F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AV99w9fQuHTtWpZT2ibb8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The panel has standout colors and contrast levels, and I had no problems in this regard. It gets bright in outdoor use, and only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-9-pro-xl-two-months-later">Pixel 9 Pro XL</a> outmatched the device in overall brightness. Stereo sound is loud and detailed, and gaming is enjoyable on the device. With 2160Hz PWM dimming as standard, it's easy on the eyes too.</p>
<p>ColorOS has decent customizability when it comes to always-on styles, and you get a decent set of choices in tailoring the device to your tastes. While the overall brightness is lower at 2500 nits, the phone gets brighter in real-world use, and that's what you actually need.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="NJU3VbyzWVmApR2bqkKQAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NJU3VbyzWVmApR2bqkKQAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>While the regular Find X8 Pro used the Dimensity 9400, the Find X8 Ultra goes back to Qualcomm silicon. There is no difference in daily use between the two, but the X8 Ultra tends to get hotter. This isn't just limited to the X8 Ultra — all phones I used powered by Qualcomm silicon this year had issues with overheating.</p>
<p>That said, the Find X8 Ultra is one of the fastest phones you can buy today. I didn't see any slowdowns whatsoever, and even demanding games ran without breaking a sweat. Having used over a dozen devices powered by this silicon, it's clear to me that there's more than adequate headroom; now we just need console-quality games to test the caliber of the hardware.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kjvmfeaBZbFUX5CH6hZVAF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kjvmfeaBZbFUX5CH6hZVAF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As I'm using the Chinese edition of the phone, I ran into issues with connectivity in general. Calls tended to be glitchy (those on the other end couldn't hear me), and OPPO has hard-coded DNS as standard, so if you use a custom DNS, you'll need to go into the settings and use a static IP and manually change your DNS server.</p>
<p>Other than that, there are no issues. The vibration motor is among the best on Android, delivering granular feedback when navigating the interface and using the keyboard. While it doesn't have Bluetooth 6.0 like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, that's about the only limitation I can think of, and it has one of the best hardware packages of any device in 2025.</p>

<p>One of the biggest changes this year is the introduction of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbide batteries</a>, and the X8 Ultra uses the tech to good effect. The phone has a much bigger 6100mAh battery, and it lasts a day and a half comfortably. In two weeks of heavy use, I didn't have to charge the phone before the end of the night, and more often than not, I just had to charge the phone once a day and a half. <br><br>There is no reason to worry about the battery, and aggressive memory management with Chinese ColorOS 15 makes the device last a little longer. Charging it takes just over 44 minutes thanks to 100W tech, and as an added bonus, it goes up to 50W over USB PD, so you don't need to use the bundled charger all the time.</p>

<p>OPPO knows how to deliver a strong camera package, and the Find X8 Ultra is one of the best phones I've used this year. It has a 1-inch 50MP Sony LYT-900 sensor (the same as last year), 50MP Samsung JN5 wide-angle, 50MP Sony LYT-700 tele lens with 3x zoom, and a secondary tele 50MP that uses the Sony LYT-600 imaging module going up to 6x. There's a 32MP camera at the front with autofocus. <br><br>The caliber of the imaging modules alone makes the Find X8 Ultra a real powerhouse, and the brand is leveraging Hasselblad's tuning to eke out magnificent shots. The interface itself is unchanged, and you can easily access the shooting modes and lenses via the viewfinder or the dedicated button on the right. <br><br>The device excels at taking videos, with all four cameras at the back able to shoot Dolby Vision footage at 4K60. That is a big deal in and of itself, but what's particularly great this year is that the device shoots Dolby Vision footage even when the ultra-steady stabilization mode is enabled.</p>

<p>Daylight photos have faultless detail and color vibrancy, and there isn't anything to criticize in this area. It's great that the X8 Ultra retains the 1-inch sensor; it allows the device to take better photos than just about any other phone today. I didn't see any problems in low-light conditions, with the phone consistently delivering vibrant shots with no visible noise. <br><br>But it's the auxiliary lenses that are truly noteworthy; you get four great cameras on the back of this phone, and the inclusion of two tele lenses makes things that much more interesting. The ability to get detailed shots at 6x and beyond is wonderful, and I got passable shots at up to 20x. <br><br>Basically, the Find X8 Ultra has one of the best camera packages I used until now. It does a better job than the Find X8 Pro, Xiaomi 15 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and holds its own against the Vivo X100 Ultra and X200 Pro. The only issue with the camera is that the device isn't launching globally, limiting its potential. While the brand says it will use these technologies in other products, it would have been great to see the Find X8 Ultra outside China.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="TLPvyJDh3vaU9mwAoxiP8F" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLPvyJDh3vaU9mwAoxiP8F.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Find X8 Ultra is available only in China, so it's using the Chinese version of the ColorOS skin based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a>. It is visually similar to the global model, but includes a ton of extras, including a local digital assistant dubbed Breeno. It is just as fluid in regular use, and the interface looks modern and has a cohesive design. That said, it ends up looking like iOS thanks to the changes introduced this year. <br><br>My biggest issue with the software is the sheer amount of bloatware that's pre-installed; it's definitely more than what's bundled with the global versions. Thankfully, most of the utilities can be uninstalled. There are the usual issues with push notifications and aggressive memory management, and it makes using the Find X8 Ultra a little annoying.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="eMYoheQtPJikLuJ66CrGBF" name="OPPO Find X8 Ultra" alt="OPPO Find X8 Ultra review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eMYoheQtPJikLuJ66CrGBF.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Continuing with the list of annoyances, ColorOS 15 has the worst DND of any Android phone; it clubs calls and messages into a single category, so there's no way to mute message notifications and not get calls. This is clearly set up by someone who doesn't make or receive any calls, because in regular use, it just doesn't make any sense. <br><br>Usually, I'll have to do at least some tweaking to get Google Mobile Services installed on a phone running a Chinese build, but that wasn't the case on this device. The Play Store APK is included, and it can be easily installed, and then you can log in to your Google account and install everything else. <br><br>Coming to updates, the Find X8 Ultra will get five years of Android updates along with six years of security updates, and that is in line with most Chinese devices. Honor is delivering seven years of Android updates to the Magic 7 Pro, but that device continues to be an outlier — at least in the context of Chinese manufacturers.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="cwJiDEBgFGyToxdoHHhsA7" name="Xiaomi 15 Ultra" alt="Xiaomi 15 Ultra back view against Indian artwork" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cwJiDEBgFGyToxdoHHhsA7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I really like the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the device has a standout camera package along with a great design and all the other extras. The best part is that the phone is available outside China — it is now on sale in India and the U.K. I prefer the color balance of the Find X8 Ultra over the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, but there's no arguing that Xiaomi has the better software package as it comes with the Play Store and all associated Google services out of the box. <br><br>I'm interested in seeing what Vivo does with the X200 Ultra, because that may just be the only device that can do better than the Find X8 Ultra; the device is slated to launch in May, so we don't have to wait too long to see what it delivers.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-oppo-find-x8-ultra-should-you-buy-it"><span>OPPO Find X8 Ultra: Should you buy it?</span></h2>

<p><strong>You should buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need the best camera package</li><li>You want a phone that takes stunning portrait shots</li><li>You need versatile cameras that shoot great videos</li><li>You want a battery that lasts a day and a half</li><li>You need all the extras</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if: </strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a phone with the Play Store pre-installed</li><li>You need the same number of software updates as your Pixel</li></ul>
<p>The only negative with the Find X8 Ultra has to do with the software; the Chinese version of ColorOS has too many inconsistencies to be usable outside the country — particularly if you want to use Google services. That's why it's annoying that the device won't be debuting in global markets; OPPO has to do better in this area, and launch its best products to a wider audience. <br><br>Other than that, there isn't anything to fault with the device. It has a great AMOLED panel, the best hardware currently available, standout battery life with the best charging tech in the industry, and the best cameras. The main 1-inch camera continues to be a delight to use in 2025, and the auxiliary lenses are among the best of any phone I used this year. <br><br>The Find X8 Ultra does a fantastic job with videos as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed using the phone. That said, I still wouldn't recommend it unless you've used a device with a Chinese interface in the past. If you don't mind the hassle of buying it via a reseller and missing out on after-sales service, then I'd suggest getting the phone solely because of the cameras.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-you-talking-about-jerry-2">What are you talking about, Jerry?</h2>
<p>In late February of this year, Apple announced that it "can no longer offer Advanced Data Protection in the United Kingdom to new users." the company gives us a good rundown on what this means <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122234" target="_blank">on its website</a> if you're more curious (you should be), but the jist of it is that the U.K. now requires Apple to provide access to encrypted iCloud data for anyone using it in the country. Rather than comply, Apple cut off millions of users.</p><p>It's important to note that this is only directed at Apple, at least for now. Google, Meta, Microsoft, and the rest of the big tech companies aren't affected. They <em>probably</em> will be soon enough.</p>
<p>This seems like a bad call and feels a little unfair to U.K. customers, but it's neither. In fact, you could say it's the opposite and Apple is doing what's best; this is what I happen to think, though I'm saying it as an outsider who doesn't live in the U.K. or use Apple products like iCloud.</p><p>Apple and its trillion-dollar trust fund are taking the fight to the courts and have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://investigatorypowerstribunal.org.uk/judgement/apple-inc-v-secretary-of-state-for-the-home-department/" target="_blank">officially filed a claim</a> against the British Home Department's Secretary of State.</p>

<p>Granting a backdoor to the government is a terrible idea, even though it may help in certain situations. Most importantly, Apple has long promised to never do it and is sticking to its guns for the time being.</p><p>It's also very important to note that the official U.S. response probably wasn't what you thought it might be. Officials in Washington don't like the idea of a backdoor for the U.K. government very much, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/26/tulsi-gabbard-uk-apple" target="_blank">stating it has</a> "grave concerns" about requiring a company to create a backdoor that would allow access to any American's encrypted data, calling it a violation of privacy and civil liberties. There was no cheering from D.C., surprisingly.</p>
<p>This should matter to you, even if you think that authorities should have a way to access encrypted data through proper channels. And I do understand why people feel that way and realize that serious crimes and acts of terror could be investigated, maybe even prevented, by doing it.</p>

<p>These high-profile cases can't be the litmus test, though. For every international drug cartel or terror cell disrupted because the "right" people could look at the "right" data, how many times will this privilege be abused?</p><p>A little old grandmother who lives in Georgia getting busted because she grows weed to help with her glaucoma is subject to the same scrutiny as the next Pablo Escobar is. That means <em><strong>you</strong></em> are, too. People doing the investigating are just people and will sometimes take the easy route. Digging through a full backup of all your phone data is pretty damn easy.</p><p>I have no idea if Apple will prevail, and can't even offer a prediction. What I do know is that if this stands, other companies in other countries will become targets of the same types of laws and, in the words of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, our civil liberties are subject to violation.</p>

However, China didn't back down either— it levied retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. as well.</p><p>We saw a gist of the trade war impact the most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a>, as its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch/oneplus-watch-3-releases-with-a-hefty-price-tag-in-the-us-and-we-dont-know-why">price went up</a> from $330 to $500 just this week. While we don't know the reason behind this price hike, many suspect that these tariffs were at play.</p><p>This trade war has got several people on edge, as China manufactures not just smartphones but also several other electronic components. And to be able to produce them in the U.S. domestically would take several years. So this move comes as a relief for many.</p><p>CNBC reports that devices that will be part of the exclusion will be semiconductors, solar cells, flat panel TV displays, flash drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives used for storing data.</p>

This time it laid off hundreds of employees from the Platforms and Devices unit on Thursday, April 10. This comes after the company has been pushing several employees to take voluntary exits for the past few months.</p><p>A source with direct knowledge of the situation said that people working within the Android platform, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser teams have been impacted by these layoffs.</p><p>In a statement to the publication, the tech giant said that since they combined the Android and Pixel teams last year, they've focused on, "becoming more nimble and operating more effectively." The Google spokesperson also stated that these cuts are in addition to the voluntary exit program the company offered to its employees in January.</p>

The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will allegedly get a $200 reduction in its price, bringing its price tag to $1,600 which is in line with a previous rumor we spotted earlier this month.</p><p>Next up is the A-series, or Google's budget devices. Android Headlines claims that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Pixel 10a</a> will be sold at the same $499 price point as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-9a-hands-on">Pixel 9a</a>. Furthermore, the company will reportedly stick to the same price until 2028 with the Pixel 12a.</p><p>However, these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt. In a separate Reddit post, someone from Android Headlines said that they've seen the pricing for Pixel 10, 11, 12, and 13 series, but “it’s all subject to change” and that “everything is a rumor until the company announces it lol.”</p>

<ul><li>Google Messages is taking a page out of iMessage's book, using color to denote RCS and SMS/MMS users.</li><li>Anyone using RCS chats, both on Android and iOS, will have their contact name colored in Material You pastels.</li><li>The Google Messages app will also place a small RCS badge to the right of contact names.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>While there are a number of visual cues to designate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS chats</a> from standard SMS/MMS messaging in the Google Messages conversation list, there aren't any before you create a new conversation. That could be changing in a future update, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-rcs-labels-3543811/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> found in an APK teardown of the Google Messages app.</p><p>In the beta version of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages app</a>, the site discovered small RCS badges beside the contact names of people who have enabled RCS when creating a new conversation. After tapping the <strong>Start chat</strong> button in Google Messages, the list of suggested contacts shows the RCS badge for RCS users and nothing for SMS/MMS users. The feature works for both RCS users on Android and iOS, which is notable.</p><p>The <strong>New conversation</strong> tab also changes the color of contact names that are using RCS. The color is changed from black to Material You pastels. These light shades are more clearly visible when using light mode compared to dark mode. This tweak bears a strong resemblance to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">how Apple handles messages</a>, using blue to denote iMessage users and green for everyone else.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1396px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:72.64%;"><img id="wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP" name="Google-Messages-RCS-Badges-Android-Authority" alt="The color codes and badges for RCS chats in Google Messages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqtVrYMrZs4EKuDQzJosKP.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1396" height="1014" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's also neat that if a contact has two numbers, you can individually see whether one or both numbers support RCS. The badges and color codes for RCS could be helpful in certain situations when you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-set-rcs-chat-samsung-phones">can only send an RCS chat</a>, like if mobile service is unavailable and you're relying on Wi-Fi.</p><p>Since this feature is working in the Google Messages app beta, it could come to the stable release soon. However, it's unclear when or if this feature will be officially released, as Google hasn't publicly announced it.</p>

The Google Pixel 8a is sticking around on the Google Store, but is still being sold at its full $499 retail price in the U.S. — the same price as the newer Pixel 9a (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/11/pixel-8a-discounted-everywhere-but-us-following-7a-google-store-removal/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>Google's Pixel phones usually remain available for purchase for a year after they've been replaced, so the Pixel 8a's availability isn't exactly a surprise. The same was true of the Pixel 7a and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-review">Pixel 6a</a> in years prior, but those models received discounts to make their value more competitive. So far, that hasn't been the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8a-review">Pixel 8a</a> following its replacement for the Pixel 9a.</p><p>The Google Pixel 8a is priced at $499 by Google, and third-party retailers aren't heavily discounting the older model either. Best Buy still lists new Pixel 8a devices at $499, whereas Amazon gives it a very slight discount at $487.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3388px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.42%;"><img id="Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn" name="Pixel-8a-Google-Store" alt="The Google Pixel 8a listing on the Google Store." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fo26idMcXD4hX75uNssTrn.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3388" height="1776" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The U.S. market appears to be the only region in which the Pixel 8a hasn't been officially discounted by Google. The smartphone now costs £399 (an £100 discount) in the U.K., and €449 in the E.U. (an €100 discount). It's possible the lack of a discount in the U.S. could be used to drive Pixel 9a sales, so that the Pixel 9a isn't competing with a discounted Pixel 8a.</p><p>As for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Pixel 7a</a>, its stock will likely dwindle now that it is no longer sold directly from Google. Currently, Best Buy does not appear to have any new Pixel 7a units available for purchase. Amazon is selling new Pixel 7a phones for $329, but it's unclear how long stock will last.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Polar has announced a new €9.99/month subscription that's very different from Garmin Connect+ but immediately invites comparisons because of the timing and outrage surrounding that service. The fact is, the number of fitness smartwatches that <em>don't</em> have a subscription is dwindling, and I'd be shocked if the remaining brands like COROS and Suunto don't decide to follow suit — not to mention Samsung.</p><p>Polar's "Fitness Program" doesn't lock key data behind a paywall like Fitbit Premium or Oura Membership. Even more so than Connect+, I'd call this subscription optional; your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-v3-review">Polar Vantage V3</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/polar-vantage-m3-gps-hr-accuracy-test">Vantage M3</a> will function the same way they did yesterday.</p><p>Instead, it's a training program linked directly to your Polar Flow data, in case you want a cheaper, native alternative to TrainingPeaks. It builds a months-long workout program tailored to your "fitness level, effort, and recovery," adapting automatically based on your progress and daily energy level.</p><p>I intend to test Polar Fitness for myself, but early signs point to it being very useful to athletes! Still, Polar (like Garmin) has always appealed to athletes who like the idea of a subscription-free watch, and the Fitness Program is pretty similar to the Garmin Coach training program that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a> owners get for free.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-connect-plus-in-depth-hands-on-much-more-than-an-ai-unfortunately">Garmin Connect+</a> is an eclectic bundle of premium features like customizable data charts, better live-tracking safety tools, new social badges, training videos for Garmin Coach, and live activities in the Connect app — all topped by semi-useful AI insights.</p><p>By contrast, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/fitness-program">Polar Fitness Program</a> is a straightforward, focused training guide that more closely aligns with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.garmin.com/en-US/garmin-technology/garmin-coach/garmin-run-coach/">Garmin Run Coach</a>. They both have workout video guidance, but the similarities end there.</p><p>Polar collects data like your training frequency, duration, intensity, and preferred training days, then combines it with your VO2 Max to create a training calendar of cardio and strength training workouts.</p><p>Each completed workout will net you stars, depending on how long you successfully stay in your target heart rate zones. And every four weeks, you'll get a badge based on how many stars you earned.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="CTWET4yLyN2RrcgPqvfkfP" name="Polar-Vantage-V3-fitspark-workout-suggestion.jpeg" alt=""Today's suggestion: Liberate your muscles" screen on the Polar Vantage V3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CTWET4yLyN2RrcgPqvfkfP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the official video guides to show proper form for strength and mobility exercises, most of this program comes down to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-training-load-focus-needs-one-obvious-fix">training load</a>, guiding athletes to hit a pyramid of HR zones with a foundation of low-HR cardio paired with some high aerobic and a peak of hard anaerobic.</p><p>Polar already has a free <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/smart-coaching/running-program">Running Program</a> with an adaptive workout plan to train for a specific race distance. This Fitness Program is more generalized for any type of athlete and focuses on improving your "cardiovascular health and endurance" whether or not you have a race ahead. That gives it more universal appeal, but it's still fair to point out that some Polar fans will wish this program was free, too — just like Garmin Coach.</p><p>On the other hand, it's for the best that Polar made its subscription so specialized, because that makes it less likely that it'll lump other premium features in with it — while <em>Garmin</em> could easily throw any cool new feature into Connect+.</p><p>That said, if Polar wants more people to subscribe, it could follow Garmin's lead and make the Fitness Program more generalized, adding AI, premium data graphs, and more.</p>
<h2 id="a-subscription-for-every-smartwatch-2">A subscription for every smartwatch</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2923px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="WLp83g35Kn66APtTaXDoZQ" name="Garmin-Connect-Plus-beta-hero-2" alt="A photo of the Garmin Connect app Home tab showing the new Connect+ Active Intelligence summary, which describes the quality and training effect of a recent three-mile track workout.

<p>Some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatches</a> have always had subscriptions, but that was the trade-off for buying a cheaper Fitbit or Amazfit; if you had to pay later for Fitbit Premium or Zepp Fitness, at least the upfront cost wasn't bad.</p><p>With brands like Garmin, Polar, Suunto, and COROS, athletes appreciated the subscription-free experience so much that they'd pay more than the market rate for one, knowing it'll last years without any hidden fees.</p><p>Then Garmin broke rank and made its subscription the new normal. I doubt Polar timed its subscription after Garmin's on purpose, but it does feel like every other Garmin-like brand is going to see subscriptions as an exciting new opportunity, no matter how much their users grumble. After all, if <em>everyone</em> is doing a subscription, people can't take their business elsewhere.</p><p>I also think more mainstream smartwatches will follow Garmin's lead. Samsung has been building up its AI insights with Energy Score last year and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/im-more-excited-about-galaxy-unpacked-samsung-health-features-than-galaxy-s25">Samsung Health Coach and vascular load</a> later in 2025. Everything is free for now, but I fully expect all these insights behind a $10/month paywall by next year.</p>

<p>Sure, you can flip it open like some sort of Star Trek communicator (you can also make Transformer noises when you open and close it), use it in flex mode like a laptop, or just do everything on the small front screen if you like. But that's not why I love them; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2024-is-the-best-pocketable-phone-and-its-on-sale-right-now">make a big phone small</a> when they're closed and that's freaking great.</p><p>I picked the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-review">Moto Razr</a> because it was cheap, but now the Z Flip 6 can be, too. Having more high-end but cheap phones to choose from is always great. <strong>Always</strong>.</p><p>The one thing I don't like about flippers is that when the battery is gone or you bust the screen, you're screwed. You'll never be able to fix it yourself, and getting it done might cost as much as buying a new one. My solution is to not drop it ever and let all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">battery saver smarts</a> in Android do their thing.</p><p>You're likely to have a phone to trade in, and Samsung is willing to give you too much money for it if you buy this one. I know the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Flip 7</a> is coming later in the year, but it's going to cost a lot more.</p><p>If you want to get yourself a really great phone that folds up so it's easy to tote around in your pocket, give this a look!</p>
