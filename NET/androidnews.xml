This time, prominent tipster Evan Blass posted renders of the alleged smartwatch lineup, giving us a good look at what to expect from this year's series.</p><p>Blass, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://evleaks.substack.com/">in his newsletter</a>, posted three images of the upcoming<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide"> Galaxy Watch 8 series</a>, showing off their design and potential colorways. Right off the bat, Blass says that the Korean OEM could launch this year's series as a trio consisting of the standard Galaxy Watch 8, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic, as well as the new Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025).</p><p>Last week, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak">similar images cropped up online</a> showing off the trio's design as well as some of its physical buttons. But this is the first time the new Ultra model is being referred to as the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025). Blass' renders imply that all three watches will sport a squircle design.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FvLpGPSHWpz6Y8KBst9mgE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sp7Ze5Cf8P4FtbL5UPELhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:720px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-series" alt="Evan Blass leaks renders of the upcoming Galaxy Watch 8 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bJCjpigBMSmS8ig9PW4LhE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="720" height="540" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>To start, the standard Galaxy Watch 8 could allegedly show up in a smoother, less noisy square-ish silver base topped by a circular dial. The Galaxy Watch 8's design sports a moderate black border/bezel around the face's circumference. The renders also show two physical buttons on one side.</p><p>The renders show the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in a rugged and thicker, silver and black colorway, sporting what looks like a rotating bezel. It gives us a clear look at two buttons on one side, flanking a smaller orange button, also rumored to be the "Quick" button, possibly giving users access to apps that they use often. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look">Previous leaks </a>suggest that the Classic variant will supposedly arrive in a single size (47mm), with a 1.5-inch display, and will have a 450mAh battery capacity.</p><p>As for the Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025), as the tipster calls it, it could show up in a deep blue colorway with a smoother silver bezel surrounding the dial. It remains unclear if this watch will have a rotating bezel, as it seems to have a much smoother outer bezel without the ridges. The renders show the watch will possess the same two physical buttons seen on the other two models and an additional smaller orange button on one side.</p><p>While these are still leaks and need to be taken with a grain of salt, the Galaxy Watch 8 series is expected to debut later this summer during Samsung's Unpacked, which<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york"> isn't too far away</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming smartwatch, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

But once specifically asked about <strong>augmented </strong>reality displays in glasses, the expert responses from Google, Meta, and others split into complicated, divergent visions of the future.</p><p>In panels like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1252">"What does it take to achieve mass market adoption of AR products?"</a>, speakers from Google, Meta, and Qualcomm hyperfixated on AI and questioned whether "AR glasses" even <em>need</em> a visual display.</p><p>They assured listeners that the world would inevitably adopt AR glasses, and even eventually "replace our phones" generations from now. But they had very different ideas on how they'd emulate smart glasses' success, given that those are more affordable and naturally stylish.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi" name="xreal-one-lenses-inside-02" alt="Xreal One smart display glasses showing a Windows desktop on its displays" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jgoHnWH37mMftq7oY5jhDi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>AR glasses today have a growing market as extended displays for gaming and streaming. Some of my favorite demos at AWE came from Viture and XREAL AR glasses, with substantially improved FoV and color since my last time trying AR glasses.</p><p>But that at-home entertainment niche aside, Big Tech wants AR glasses to serve as stylish, all-day companions for everyday consumers. That's a much taller order.</p><p>Here's everything I pieced together from AWE 2025 panels about how AR glasses will evolve over the next few years — including the ways that Meta and Google, in particular, see AR glasses' future very differently.</p><h2 id="ar-glasses-don-t-have-one-clear-blueprint-for-success-like-smart-glasses-2">AR glasses don't have one clear blueprint for success like smart glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aZXYMqr7g7kFJmWmfHJxMN" name="AWE-2025-smart-glasses-panel" alt="A stage with four XR panelists sitting in armchairs atop a stage at AWE 2025, with Long Beach artwork on the large screen behind them." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aZXYMqr7g7kFJmWmfHJxMN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Meta's Kelly Ingham, Lenovo's Jason McGuigan, and XREAL's Ralph Jodice at AWE 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During her panel "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1242">State of Smart Glasses and What's Around the Corner</a>," Meta VP of AR Devices Kelly Ingham addressed the obvious challenges facing AR glasses today.</p><p>"Displays are still heavy, right? How do you put a display in front of your eyes and have it be comfortable?" she asked rhetorically. "Is it monocular, or is it binocular? You add more weight, you add more cost."</p><p>XREAL's Ralph Jodice, whose company recently made <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-android-xr-glasses-project-aura-meta-orion-similar">Android XR-powered AR glasses</a>, noted that while they've successfully grown FoV from 30º to 57º in the last couple years and will soon hit 70º, their customers aren't satisfied. The main demand is "Make my FoV wider, make my glasses smaller," and doing both is an obvious "challenge."</p><p>Ingham concluded that there will be a "broad set of categories" for AR glasses, from 30-degree displays for notification windows to 70-degree displays for full-on entertainment, and from cloud-based AI through your phone to a "full computer on your head." There's no one set path to success.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="W6EgH5xGaqqG9hK55NxL9N" name="AWE-2025-AR-mass-market-panel" alt="A stage at AWE 2025 with a moderator at the podium and three XR executives from Google, Meta, and Qualcomm seated next to him on stage." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W6EgH5xGaqqG9hK55NxL9N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Bernard Kress, Meta's Edgar Auslander, and Qualcomm's Said Bakadir at AWE 2025 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Bernard Kress, Director of Google AR, made a similar point in the aforementioned <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://awexr.com/usa-2025/agenda/1252">panel</a> on mass market adoption of AR. He described a range of potential AR "market segments":</p><ul><li>Monocolor AR glasses with basic, subtle text function</li><li>Full-color single-display glasses like the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/my-demo-with-googles-ar-glasses-went-better-than-the-one-on-stage">Google AR prototype</a></li><li>Binocular, full FoV glasses like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-orion-hands-on">Meta Orion</a> or Snap Spectacles with higher power demands and "bigger form factors"</li><li>Affordable "smart goggles" like <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">XREAL One</a> that don't need to "look like regular glasses"</li><li>Full optical see-through (OST) headsets like the Hololens</li></ul><p>What Kress didn't say is that this nebulousness makes it very difficult to imagine AR glasses' future, because it's far too complicated for non-techies to understand.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">Smart glasses</a> also have a range of form factors. But most people will see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta glasses</a> as the template for smart glasses: built-in speakers and cameras, AI assistance, and phone connectivity in a "normal" glasses design.</p><p>We'll see a wider range of looks with the rumored <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">Oakley Meta glasses</a> or Android XR glasses <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr-glasses-coming-designed-by-gentle-monster-warby-parker">designed by Warby Parker and Gentle Monster</a>, but the core experience should be consistent and appealing to everyday folks.</p><h2 id="google-thinks-ar-needs-a-killer-app-first-to-succeed-2">Google thinks AR needs a killer app first to succeed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ" name="Android-XR-Maps-2" alt="A still from an Android XR example video of how the software will work on smart glasses, showing someone navigating city streets with Google Maps, with a map view holograph showing when to turn." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Qy5kKNMYZ5UfmAMFAXFqCZ.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>During the mass-market AR panel, the moderator asked Google's Kress and reps from Meta and Qualcomm, "Do smart glasses have to have a display to be AR?"</p><p>"I would say, 'Not necessarily,'" responded Edgar Auslander, a Senior Director at Meta. As long as your "reality is augmented," it could be audio, visual, or any other sensory changes. By that definition, Meta AI glasses are "AR glasses," which is questionable.</p><p>Kress took a different perspective. For him, AR glasses must have a display, but must also offer "something that cannot be replaced by audio." Multimodal AI — the killer app for smart glasses that analyzes what you see — might benefit from a display, but it already works without one.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59" name="Android-XR-demo-Google-io-2025-6" alt="Michael Hicks wearing Android XR prototype glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GUVm5y3P7RJDihk9ZwmH59.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Google's Android XR prototype glasses </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Kress, who worked on the original Google Glass, explained that once the novelty wore off, consumers had "no real use for it." That's why Glass transitioned to enterprise, where developers could get clear "return on investment (ROI)" in areas like automotive, avionics, surgery, and architecture.</p><p>So what will change with AR glasses now? Kress believes the visual component only becomes necessary when you can achieve "World Locking," where 6DoF tracking and a visual positioning system let glasses accurately point to a specific, physical element of your world. Right now, the Android XR UI can only hover in empty space.</p><p>You also need affordable, power-efficient microLEDs to display the data clearly and efficiently, Kress noted.

In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Faster-smoother-camera-timeline/ba-p/722288">community update</a>, Google states v3.33 of the app is rolling out now on Android and will address the laggy and, at times, low FPS experience that its camera timeline previously suffered. Specifically, Google says v3.33 "substantially improved" the framerate and loading performance for users.</p><p>Now, users scrolling through the camera timeline to view old events <em>should </em>find an easier, smoother time. The improvements made to scrubbing through the video's timeline should make it easier for users to spot anything of importance, as the old laggy experience might've made this difficult.</p><p>Google adds that this update cuts down on timeline loading times and "frozen" moments.</p><p>The Home app update also brings a "limited access member tier." In short, homeowners can "invite" people into their smart home ecosystem at a "level" that works for them.

What's immediately highlighted is the company's use of a 1-3-4 core architecture for the supposed Dimensity 9500 SoC. The listing claims the chip possesses a single core at 3.23GHz, which is surprising, but there may be a reason for this.</p><p>The Geekbench listing adds that the Dimensity 9500 contains three cores clocked at 3.03GHz and four cores at 2.23GHz.</p><p>After taking the platform's CL benchmark test, the chip allegedly received a score of 15,717.</p><p>Moreover, a comment on the tipster's thread on X highlights a new development: the existence of a Mali-G1-Ultra GPU. It appears that this GPU is from Arm; however, it's not the typical Immortatlis GPU we've seen consistently in recent history for SoCs.</p><h2 id="mediatek-s-next-flagship-2">MediaTek's next flagship</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dimensity 9500 pic.twitter.com/zOgxUdnLrH<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1934419737959882899">June 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>These rumored early specs for MediaTek's next flagship Dimensity are strange, especially considering <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">the Dimensity 9400's power</a>. The current generation's flagship features the same 1-3-4 core setup at 3.62GHz, 3.3GHz, and 2.4GHz, respectively. Moreover, it features a 12-core Immortalis-G925 GPU. We're still waiting to see more about this new graphics processor; the 9500 chip is supposedly rocking.</p><p>Though it's strange — the difference in power — the publication claims this is likely due to the early testing stage. More specifically, it says these lower clock speeds "clearly indicate it is not performing as per spec." In reality, it wouldn't make sense for MediaTek to release a "next-gen" flagship SoC that's weaker than last year's flagship. It would feel more like a mid-range chip in that case.</p><p>So, we'll most likely have to wait a little while longer before we see the true power of the Dimensity 9500, which the post claims will "trade blows" with Qualcomm's next Elite SoC.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that MediaTek launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> SoC earlier this year. This model takes things up a notch over the original 9400 chip. For its single core, the chip clocks in at 3.73GHz, so it seems MediaTek is really trying to push toward the 4GHz mark.</p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Spotted first by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/16/google-play-slide-buy/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, this “Slide to buy” feature is now live across the whole digital lineup, such as apps, books, movies, you name it.</p><p>This change appears to be rolling out wide with Play Store version 46.5.19-31.

This new slide move is Google's way of cutting down those oops moments for good.</p><p>With this change, now you have to swipe sideways to confirm before the usual password or fingerprint step kicks in. This new slide-to-buy gesture works the same whether you’re grabbing a one-off app or signing up for a subscription through the Play Store.</p><p>This swipe move is a solid upgrade, especially for people who’ve dialed back or turned off purchase checks. It’s a smart way to make buying stuff a whole lot less stressful, and honestly, we’re all here for it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Instead, the tech giant is tapping the telephoto lens to boost close-up shots even more, according to a fresh leak from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-tele-macro-camera" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>.</p><p>This move makes sense when you consider how each lens focuses—telephoto needs more space, while ultrawide gets real close. So, with the Pixel 10, Google is making it smart enough to pick the right lens on the fly depending on how near your subject is.</p><p>At present, Pixel phones mostly rely on the ultrawide lens for macro shots, thanks to some smart engineering tweaks like autofocus that help nail those close-up details. And from the looks of it, that setup isn’t going anywhere with the Pixel 10.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J" name="Google-Pixel-9-Pixel-9-Pro-all-colors.jpg" alt="Holding all the different colors of the Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/a3XUyNhNPt2FimnuKekd6J.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Shruti Shekar / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="telephoto-s-macro-perks-2">Telephoto’s macro perks</h2><p>Compared to ultrawide lenses, telephoto lenses have some nifty perks for macro shots. They give you a nice, creamy background blur thanks to a shallower depth of field, which is ideal for making your subject pop. Plus, they avoid the funky distortions ultrawide shooters sometimes bring when you get up close.</p><p>It’s still up in the air whether this new telephoto-powered macro feature will be available across the whole Pixel 10 lineup. But with the official reveal just a couple months out, we won’t be waiting long to find out.</p><p>On top of beefed-up macro shots, the Pixel 10 is also said to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-video-recording-upgrade">step up its video stabilization</a>.

To help businesses grow, the Meta-owned service is launching "Ads in Status." With this new feature, the post states its purpose is to "encourage" better/quicker communication between potential new customers and the business in question.</p><p>WhatsApp published a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://business.whatsapp.com/whatsapp-ads">business-focused page</a>, stating people who have created a Channel for their business can also utilize it.</p><p>The platform states the ads it provides were built with "privacy in mind."

However, WhatsApp reiterates its commitment to keeping your texts, calls, and statuses private through end-to-end encryption (E2EE).</p><p>Joining "Ads in Status" is WhatsApp's new "Promoted Channels" feature. As previously stated, the app will use some limited data on you to determine what content you <em>might </em>be interested in seeing/interacting with.

Now, if there's a channel making content you enjoy, WhatsApp is letting you (and them) offer support for "exclusive updates" for a monthly fee. These fees will likely be left up to the admin of the channel that's offering exclusive content for its subscribers.</p><p>These three updates were announced today (June 16), so they should've started rolling out already. However, it might take a little while, so just ensure WhatsApp is updated on your phone or tablet as the week continues.</p><p>Rolling out business-focused content updates isn't anything new for WhatsApp, as the platform <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/whatsapp-updates-app-e-commerce-features">brought in-app shopping capabilities</a> a while ago.

Shi says that this line of phones is a "performance powerhouse that offers endless endurance, allowing you to play and create all day and night."</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1996px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.51%;"><img id="39T9RoFij65crEykCYLi8D" name="OnePlus-Nord-5-series-launch" alt="OnePlus set to launch 5 new products soon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/39T9RoFij65crEykCYLi8D.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1996" height="1128" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1996px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.51%;"><img id="qoHc2vjs78PTxTXvhBhMND" name="OnePlus-Nord-5-series-launch" alt="OnePlus set to launch 5 new products soon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qoHc2vjs78PTxTXvhBhMND.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1996" height="1128" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As for what powers this phone, the OnePlus Nord 5 will come with Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 Mobile chipset, an advanced 7,300mm² CryoFlex Liquid Cooling System, as well as impressive camera specs, Shi added, without revealing much about its specs.</p><p>Images and teasers of the OnePlus Nord 5 series suggest a resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-quietly-launched-two-new-ace-5-series-phones-and-they-look-spectacular">OnePlus Ace 5 series</a>, which was launched in China exclusively for gamers. However, the phones could be tweaked based on the region they're launching in; for instance, the Ace 5 Ultra features a MediaTek Dimensity 9400+ chipset, but the Nord 5 is confirmed to come with a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 Mobile Platform.</p><p>Speaking about the device's colorways, Shi revealed one color for each phone, indicating that there may be additional colors. The OnePlus Nord 5 will launch in Dry Ice, and the OnePlus Nord CE 5 in Marble Mist, among other options.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1996px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.51%;"><img id="HL2rMxC7u5svs3z2de4qxC" name="OnePlus-Nord-5-series-launch" alt="OnePlus set to launch 5 new products soon" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HL2rMxC7u5svs3z2de4qxC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1996" height="1128" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, Shi revealed that a smaller version of the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-hands-on">OnePlus Watch 3</a> will also launch along with the Nord series lineup.

"We're delighted to bring this to them this summer.

"For gamers, the OnePlus Buds 4 also offer 47ms ultra-low latency in Game Mode, ensuring audio syncs perfectly with on-screen action for a competitive edge," Shi said.  The OnePlus Buds 4 will be available in two colour options: Zen Green and Storm Gray.</p><p>OnePlus is all set to launch the OnePlus Nord 5 series and the rest of its products on July 8 in the U.K. and Europe. However, there's no information on whether a global launch is in the books.  For those interested, OnePlus' <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.oneplus.com/uk/launch/2025-summer-launch-event">website</a> has a 'notify me' option to be alerted as soon as the products drop.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone also boasts a truly-stunning 6.8-inch OLED 120Hz display, while the IP69 water/dust resistance rating is so tough that you can actually run the phone through a dishwasher cycle without receiving any damage (I&apos;m not sure why you would, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/Pl5QVUadfbs"><strong>it&apos;s pretty cool nonetheless</strong></a>). </p><p>On the other hand, most of the OnePlus 13&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">AI features</a> require internet connectivity, and the six years of software support lag slightly behind the latest upgrade promises from Samsung and Google.

There will be four smartphone models in the Pixel 12 all codenamed after primates (with the exception of a folk creature) according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/133" target="_blank">Mystic Leaks on Telegram</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/16/pixel-12-codenames/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>).</p><p>The leaker claims the base-model Google Pixel 12 is codenamed <strong>Galago</strong>, the Pixel 12 Pro is codenamed <strong>Sasquatch</strong>, the Pixel 12 Pro XL is codenamed <strong>Silverback</strong>, and the Pixel 12 Pro Fold is codenamed <strong>Capuchin</strong>. The names could correlate, at least in part, to the models' respective sizes.</p><p>Galagos, for instance, are known for their small size. That's the alleged reference for the smallest Pixel 12 member, the base model. Meanwhile, silverback gorillas — the codename for the large Pixel 12 Pro XL — are known for being five-feet tall and weighing over 400 pounds on average.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9Wakyv6fZY8oCs4zMfap5X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Wakyv6fZY8oCs4zMfap5X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">A collection of Google Pixel phones updated to Android 16. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google has used families of animals for Pixel codenames dating back to the Pixel 6 series, which were all named after birds. Since then, we've seen references to cats, dogs, and reptiles. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-supposed-codenames-leaked">Google Pixel 10 series is said to be codenamed after horses</a>, and the next Pixel 11 generation is rumored to be codenamed after bears. Now, Mystic Leaks believes the further-out Pixel 12 lineup will be named after primates.</p><p>Of course, these codenames are strictly for internal development use. But like old-fashioned Android codenames, they serve as fun ways to track the progress of future Google Pixel hardware. For now, these references don't reveal much about the company's plan for its 2027 lineup of flagship Android smartphones.</p><p>It does seem to indicate that Google plans to keep the Pixel lineup roughly as-is in terms of offerings and sizes. If the company wanted to add a different-sized base model flagship, we might've seen five leaked codenames instead of four. The same could be true if Google planned to introduce a flip-style foldable to pair with the Google Pixel Fold series.</p><p>However, it's always possible that Google has tricks up its sleeve, so we can't rule anything out based on rumored codenames alone.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The aim is to help people sleep better.

Moreover, Galaxy Watch users, while wearing the smartwatch and running for 12 minutes, can immediately receive a performance analysis and a running level score.

It is said to be utilizing an industry-first feature to assess carotenoid levels in about five seconds, backed by an advanced, light-activated BioActive sensor.</p><p>All these insights supposedly reflect behavioral changes. The aim of the feature is to tackle radicals in the body caused by behavioral factors like alcohol consumption, smoking, for example. Antioxidants, on the other hand, will neutralize those free radicals in order to prevent chronic illness. Thus, the feature with the ability to measure carotenoid antioxidants helps Galaxy Watch users adopt healthier habits.</p><h2 id="galaxy-watch-5-series-and-above-2">Galaxy Watch 5 series and above</h2><p>These advanced features are available for Galaxy Watch users who are willing to try out the One UI 8 Watch beta.

Meta teased the new partnership on social media, creating a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.instagram.com/oakleymeta/">Instagram Oakley Meta account</a>, teasing that "the next evolution is coming on June 20."</p><p>We first heard about a potential Oakley Meta partnership <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/metas-xr-plans-reportedly-include-seeding-orion-to-devs-and-oakley-smart-glasses">back in January</a>. Leaks suggested a new pair of smart glasses was in development, dubbed "Supernova 2," a direct follow-up to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review">Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses</a>, which feature the code name "Supernova."</p><p>Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses feature a camera on the left side of the frame, while Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are rumored to feature a camera in the center.</p><p>Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are also rumored to use Oakley Sphaera frames. I created a mock-up above using Sphaera frames and an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://us.shop.xreal.com/products/xreal-eye">Xreal Eye camera</a> centered just under the nose bridge, similar to how Xreal positions it on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One</a> series smart glasses.</p><p>While we don't have official imagery of these new Oakley glasses just yet, this should give you an idea of how they might look.</p><h2 id="sportier-than-ray-bans-2">Sportier than Ray-Bans</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD" name="Engo-2-AR-glasses-close-up" alt="ENGO 2 AR glasses sitting on a deck at a front-left-facing angle." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9wuFy3ZbGPgC6aFVss9aD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pictured above are the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ar-running-glasses-arent-ready-yet-but-future-is-almost-here">ENGO 2 HUD</a> smart glasses, which look similar to many Oakley styles. ENGO 2 HUD features a small screen to help athletes keep track of stats without having to look down at a watch, but we don't expect Meta to pack a display into Oakley Meta Smart Glasses. Instead, it's far more likely that these Oakley frames will be designed for streaming and recording footage as their main function.</p><p>If Oakley Meta Smart Glasses are anything like the Ray-Ban Metas, they'll feature the battery and other electronics in the arms rather than on the nose bridge as ENGO did. While it's possible that Meta could outfit its new Oakley-branded smart glasses with fitness-focused extras like a heart rate monitor, we haven't seen credible rumors yet suggesting that as a possibility.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS" name="ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-charging-case" alt="Special edition transparent Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses with their black leather charging case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/osCcj5UBZceAcax3mf6NyS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We do expect Oakley Meta Smart Glasses to be a better fit for athletes than Ray-Ban Metas, though. Android Central's Michael Hicks recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">ran a marathon with Ray-Ban Metas</a> and found that, while the functionality was excellent, the fit wasn't quite right for running. Oakley Meta Smart Glasses should fix this with a design that's better suited for athletic activities, including running, cycling, and other sports.</p><p>We fully expect Meta to introduce a third generation of Ray-Ban Meta glasses later this year, as well, which are said <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-with-display-rumor">to include a display</a> in one of the lenses. But we probably won't see these until Meta Connect 2025 in mid-September.</p><p>For now, Oakley Meta Smart Glasses will be the first big commercial smart glasses announcement from Meta in 2025. Given that Ray-Ban Metas sold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-are-a-hit-and-its-now-planning-a-massive-production-ramp-up">2 million units and counting</a>, we're curious how Oakley Meta glasses will match up for popularity.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The rumors of the device have been swirling around for the past two years. While we have seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-flip-7-fe-leaked-minty-design-renders-specs-rumors">renders</a> of the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE earlier, it is interesting to see the device finally seeing the light of day, according to these recent certifications.</p><p>The expected specifications of the Galaxy Z Flip FE include a 6.7-inch foldable 120Hz screen coupled with a 3.4-inch cover screen. Underneath, the foldable device is expected to ship with an Exynos 2400e chipset paired with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of onboard storage. For optics, it could have a 50MP primary lens and a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens, and a 10MP shooter for selfies. It is likely to have One UI 8 (Android 16) on board and feature a 4000mAh battery.</p><p>Alongside the Galaxy Z Flip 7 FE, Samsung will also introduce the Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7, and the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> Galaxy Watch 8</a> series at the upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event, most likely <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-unpacked-could-take-place-in-new-york">happening in early July</a>.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The smallest charger I ever used is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/oppo-50w-mini-supervooc-charger">OPPO mini SuperVOOC</a> model; it is extremely thin and still manages to deliver 50W charging.

Most GaN chargers tend to be squarish, but the flatter profile clearly makes a difference in this regard. And like the best chargers, the UltraSlim utilizes GaN tech to good effect, delivering reliable USB PD charging in a diminutive size.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrtVu8zyLGNrNgkAQHiEqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Build quality is great, and I didn't see any issues in the month I used the charger.

Each port hits 45W over the USB PD 3.0 standard, and you get the usual charging profiles: 5V/3A, 9V/3A, 12V/3A, and 15V/3A. It does a good job with Samsung devices as well thanks to PPS, and because you get two ports, there's a total 70W power budget (35W max with each port) when both are in use. If you're using it with a phone and any accessory, it switches to 45W + 20W.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb" name="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W" alt="EZQuest UltraSlim 70W GaN charger review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZL2dNYYtMKJkeDAxxHZinb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you don't need more than two USB-C charging ports, the UltraSlim is a great travel charger; it's much smaller than its mainstream rivals, and 45W charging out of each port is ideal if you're using Pixel or Galaxy devices.

Right off the bat, you’ll see a big preview of your watch and its current face. Just below that, key information like battery level, last sync time, and connection status is front and center. There’s even a handy “Sync now” button tucked in the top-right corner for quick refreshes.</p><h2 id="familiar-but-cleaner-layout-2">Familiar, but cleaner layout</h2><p>Right under your Fitbit’s preview, you’ll see neatly organized cards for Watch Faces, Apps, and Tiles. These are straight out of the Pixel Watch app playbook. The layout has gained a fresh coat of paint, but don’t expect anything wild—those cards still lead to the same settings you’ve been using.</p><p>Even the main settings menu got a fresh coat of paint. On a Fitbit Sense 2, for instance, you’ll now spot organized sections like Notifications, Device Preferences, Google Services (Wallet and Maps), Fitbit Reminders & Alerts, Tips & Support, System, and Smart Features like Alexa and on-wrist calls.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2FeLBvxu5HsJnAGb3hqUPV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:383px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.54%;"><img id="7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7fK9mx3kFnWZV8fDMEjvRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="383" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:352px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:244.32%;"><img id="k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV" name="Fitbit-app-redesign" alt="visual overhaul for the Fitbit app's design settings menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k2TyReY5N7Ru3fMw9xQsRV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="352" height="860" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="material-3-expressive-makeover-incoming-2">Material 3 Expressive makeover incoming</h2><p>Outside of the device settings revamp, Google is also prepping the Fitbit app for a full Material 3 Expressive makeover.

It’s a simple touch, but it makes reading the settings way more intuitive.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="XMW4JmqpmJLjp2PUYCKi4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XMW4JmqpmJLjp2PUYCKi4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="W9VPwXMjZcfr3SLB3X8a4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/W9VPwXMjZcfr3SLB3X8a4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:385px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.42%;"><img id="PubhzNQCnBLG5GSsFegU4j" name="Pixel-Camera-settings-menu" alt="Material 3 Expressive redesign for the settings menu of Pixel Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PubhzNQCnBLG5GSsFegU4j.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="385" height="864" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="more-than-just-a-settings-refresh-2">More than just a Settings refresh</h2><p>Right now, the changes are mostly tucked away in the Settings menu, but this is just the start.

It appears the company is having yet another product up its sleeve dubbed the OnePlus Pad Lite.</p><p>The renders of a new upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-tablets">Android tablet</a> from the company have surfaced, which were shared by Steve Hemmerstoffer (aka OnLeaks) together with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oneplus-pad-lite-design-specifications-leaked-exclusive/">91mobiles</a>. The OnePlus Pad Lite is tailored for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-tablet">budget Android tablet</a> segment and touted to be the successor to the company's first budget tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go, launched in 2023.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good Morning #FutureSquad!

It includes a single rear camera at the back, and the front should have a 11-inch LCD display. It is expected to come in 1920 x 1080 resolution with a 90Hz refresh.</p><p>Underneath, the Pad Lite is likely to include a MediaTek Helio G100 chipset with 2.2GHz clock speeds paired with up to 6GB RAM and 128GB onboard storage — with more options available during the launch. The tablet is also touted with a 9340mAh battery capacity — a significant improvement over the predecessor, which had 8000mAh.</p><p>The tablet is believed to be coming with a 5MP rear camera next to a 5MP front-facing camera. However, the predecessor had offered 8MP cameras each. The expected dimensions comprise 254.9 x 166.5 x 7.4mm and weigh around 539 grams. Overall, the device should feel a bit taller, wider, and thinner than the previous iteration.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pEn3bEfRsiNFTE9oW4EdSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:819px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.26%;"><img id="wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-01" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wqs4sJ2dTwyNbKdHCPkZSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="819" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:85.71%;"><img id="9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ" name="OnePlus-Pad-Lite-renders-leak-02" alt="OnePlus Pad Lite renders leak" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Tdp6HQ7dF4mV9PT9Z4fSQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="700" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks via 91mobiles)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><h2 id="launch-still-unclear-2">Launch still unclear</h2><p>The OnePlus Pad Lite could be carrying an Aero Blue colorway with a folio cover accessory also complementary to the tablet's cover.

Instead, I found out the hard way what happens when you ignore Garmin's algorithm.</p><p>I spent May in a bit of a running slump, my mileage dipping about 40 miles from my monthly average. So I decided to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/you-need-a-fitness-reboot-this-summer-your-smartwatch-has-the-tools-you-need">rebound in June</a> with more steps and miles. I kicked things off with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/running-a-half-marathon-with-ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses">half marathon while wearing Ray-Ban Metas</a> on June 1, and then I decided that I could do another hard, hilly run on Global Running Day with a local running group.</p><p>By the end of my 7-mile run, I'd fallen behind the group and felt physically weak with a tight right hamstring. I checked my watch later and found I was right above my body's running tolerance.</p><p>But since I desperately wanted to rejuvenate my fitness efforts, I went out for a low-aerobic jog a couple of days later once my training readiness score had climbed up a bit. It was a mistake: Even if my heart and lungs felt fine, my hamstring all but gave out on me. I ended up limping home.

I also checked out their ultra-bright microLED display, the in-vogue tech for AR glasses and smartwatches.</p><p>But Kopin's most promising tech for consumers is its NeuralDisplay. It uses "traditional RGB pixels, image-sensing pixels, and advanced signal processing algorithms" to track your eye movement and neurological response in a functional VR display.</p><p>I saw the tech in action at AWE (and you can see a video example below). The Kopin engineer shone a flashlight into his eye, and the display immediately detected his pupil dilation and adjusted the brightness and contrast to prevent any discomfort.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipqm5IJNVSE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The version they showed off at AWE, built on OLED but compatible with microLED, can adjust the display's content automatically to match the user's gaze and simulate depth.</p><p>It can track data like the user's blinking rate to judge if the person is fatigued or enable foveated rendering, all without needing any SoC processing power. And in the case of military applications (or FPS games), this tech could determine that the user isn't looking in the direction of a threat and guide their gaze that way.</p><p>It's still an in-progress prototype that needs silicon improvements to enable better color accuracy and sensitivity. But CEO Michael Murray said that they proved wrong the naysayers who "said we couldn't pull it off," and that companies like Meta, Apple, and Anduril will be very interested in licensing their patent so that they can shed the weight of their eye-tracking cameras.

Hand tracking works pretty well on most recent headsets like the Quest and Vision Pro, but having a wearable controller adds more precision so you're not vainly struggling with missed camera inputs while trying to work.</p><p>Almost no one will end up using Sony's premium XYN headset; it's designed for "spatial content creation," meaning only enterprise users willing to drop nearly five grand to create CADs will need one. But it's still a promising sign of how immersive XR headsets are getting, and I love the flip-up display design for productivity.</p><h2 id="android-xr-smart-ring-controls-2">Android XR smart ring controls</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd" name="Android-XR-smart-ring-controls-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a Kiwear smart ring capable of gesture controls, using it to slice fruit in Fruit Ninja on a tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the Qualcomm show booth, they had a space for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250610859777/en/KiWear-Unveils-Smart-Ring-Input-Solution-for-AI-Glasses-in-Collaboration-with-Qualcomm-at-AWE-USA-2025">KiWear</a>, a smart ring reference design for gesture controls for AR, XR, and smart glasses. And it's surprisingly accurate and intuitive.</p><p>Connected to RayNeo X3 Pro glasses, the ring could control the display UI using simple finger movements or rotations around your finger. The IMU could differentiate between pinches away from or towards you for different functions, and the built-in PPG could display health data on the glasses.</p><p>You can also reach the ring out to tap virtual objects or use the ring touchpad to select or scroll. It even worked for accurate gaming controls when playing Fruit Ninja.</p><p>Given that Qualcomm announced that Android XR will support smart ring controls, I wonder if the next Samsung Galaxy Ring will be more specifically designed for XR controls to pair with Moohan and its smart glasses.

For example, color passthrough on the Quest 3 can be useful when you want to retain some awareness of your surroundings while you're flailing about playing Beat Saber. However, it does have its limitations.</p><p>If you're like me, you likely have your phone with you at all times and check it frequently. The problem with VR is that even with passthrough, it's not always easy to see what's on your screen. And if you're really like me, then you're probably blind as a bat but too stubborn to use your glasses with your VR headset, making the passthrough view even more challenging to use when trying to read text on your phone display.</p><p>Fortunately, Motorola has a solution for Quest 3 and Quest 3S owners that lets you use your phone on your VR headset. It can come in pretty handy, although it's not without its quirks, and not everyone will have access to it.</p><h2 id="what-is-smart-connect-2">What is Smart Connect?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-Smart-Connect-VR-headset" alt="VR Headset option in Motorola Smart Connect" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C5odHXQPDjZAMAfcMTmFx5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Motorola launched its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-motorola-smart-connect">Smart Connect app</a> on the Meta Quest 3 earlier this year as an easy way to stream and control your phone from within your headset.

You can select from just about any app on your phone to stream to the headset, and it'll open in a phone-like view. You can also use your phone to open any app on your VR headset by swiping up and sending it to Smart Connect.</p><p>What's great about this is that you can regularly scroll, view videos, and even send messages straight from your headset. You can also have up to three open and active apps in one window and easily move between them. You can also resize some apps by rotating or using the resize button up top, which can open certain apps like Gmail in a tablet-like view. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, and not every app will scale properly.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3363px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ" name="11964c1dcda851b9432c811baba04858" alt="Streaming multiple apps via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NN8FT4mAUSQ8tYz9vAuSCQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3363" height="1891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3020px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ" name="f8e0ca67dfb25cce9b33915afebfc6e9" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/J7pybhoqqFGohF9DoDRUAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3020" height="1698" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3054px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ" name="dfbb86b9b5ee5875ff54447f6b66f6cb" alt="Gmail via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HXAVrLntqcoM848oHGoqBQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3054" height="1718" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>For some apps, such as Instagram, you may be better off using the native Quest app, as it's more optimized for the VR display than the Smart Connect version.

For instance, with app streaming, while most apps you use are likely displayed vertically, horizontal apps (usually games) may have trouble and sometimes won't open at all. I find it helps to tap the expand button above the app to help things along, and usually it should work. However, this issue also extends to YouTube, for example, which doesn't scale properly in horizontal orientation unless you're in full-screen mode.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2938px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ" name="0d1de276a5fa28a0adcf102ebdf0d838" alt="YouTube via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JLeiYoxgpimo3nM65VwkAQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2938" height="1653" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3021px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q" name="accb70fead6d9e91cf4be2fa14531f8c" alt="A full-screen YouTube video via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rAFAF8gUukQNY62tj5Mq8Q.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3021" height="1699" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The keyboard experience is also pretty wonky and oftentimes confusing. It's a much more limited experience than the normal Quest keyboard, so you don't have options like swiping to type or word suggestions. That means, when you make a mistake, there's no easy way to correct it without going back or deleting.</p><p>The problem is, the keyboard view and what's on the app don't always sync up correctly. If I move the cursor back to correct a word on the keyboard view, the cursor in the app will stay in place and start deleting or adding words at the end of my sentence. So it'll look correct on the keyboard but not on the app. I can always move the cursor in the app to correct the word, but then it won't do the same on the keyboard view.</p><p>The only way I found I could get around the typing experience is to just use the Gboard's voice typing, which comes in clutch. However, this is only accessible in the app view, not on the Quest keyboard.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1801px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP" name="e6197be6ba13efe52bff9824a81dfd73" alt="Google Messages and Gboard voice typing via Smart Connect on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QViTVbTcpcv5GFyKzTdYwP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1801" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But perhaps my biggest problem is scaling.

To exit a full-screen app in this mode, swipe down from the top of the window until a bar appears, then click the <strong>X</strong> button.</p><p>It's not the most intuitive experience, and unfortunately, many of these issues have been carried over from the desktop version of Smart Connect.</p><h2 id="a-decent-start-2">A decent start</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ" name="12939c99808dacb222108051a33516b3" alt="Smart Connect app streaming while Beat Saber is paused on the Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sK7qxGYPAJaYrqr6dDFRBQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3650" height="2053" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate having to fully interrupt my VR immersion by removing the headset to check my phone.

Buttons need to be bigger, the keyboard experience needs some improvements, notifications should be more prevalent in <em>both</em> modes, and I would love to see more functions from the desktop version of Smart Connect, such as phone mirroring.</p><p>Still, this is a good start, and if you're the owner of a Quest 3 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-motorola-phones">Motorola phone</a>, you should give Smart Connect a try.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A bad water leak inside my home means I have to replace some of my electrical wiring and almost all of my cable internet equipment as well as the water heater. Since I'm using a well, there was no usage spike on the meter to warn me I had a problem so it's hard to tell how long this has gone on, but it made one hell of a mess. What a way to start a week.</p><p>I spent the time installing one coaxial cable to a dry spot so I could reconnect my internet service. I work from home and it's vital I have it because working at McDonald's is ... well ... terrible. I appreciate them allowing me to come in and spend the afternoon and they even gave me a free coffee. You'll find some good people in the country; what you won't find is adequate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/2021-needs-focus-rural-5g-help-save-my-terrible-broadband-experience">high-speed internet</a>.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Android & Chill</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n" name="android-n-chill.JPG" caption="" alt="Android Central mascot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6okfEqHJFPcbznZSbSNW3n.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">One of the web's longest-running tech columns, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-and-chill">Android & Chill</a> is your Saturday discussion of Android, Google, and all things tech.</p></div></div><p>I have the "choice" of one internet provider. Ignore what you hear about competition laws and rules because they have never mattered here. My internet provider needs to replace some of their equipment (just a glorified coaxial connector) attached to my home. They will be able to do it on Wednesday. Until then, I'm left on my own. It's not the provider's fault that water damaged everything. I also understand they can't send a technician out into the woods to service one person if they're busy. My understanding doesn't help my situation.</p><p>Where all this becomes a problem is cellular coverage. Remember all the promises of nationwide wireless broadband and how it was coming thanks to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/mobile-broadband-5g-still-needs-fixing">miracle of 5G</a>? It was a lie. I do have cell service at my house but it's not nearly fast enough to be useful for anyone who works from home. As for the "choice" of wireless providers? Mine is T-Mobile or one of several MVNOs that use T-Mobile's infrastructure. I even drove into town and grabbed a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-home-internet-review">Home Internet kit</a> because someone thought it might be fast enough, but it's not.</p><p>I choose to live here because I like it here. But it's high time everyone realizes that rural communities have been told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/t-mobile-and-other-carriers-still-havent-covered-rural-areas-regardless-what-they-say">promise after promise</a> of how they would be brought into the 21st century with adequate information access and it never happens. Forget all the commercials and testimonials companies like to show you because all you <em>really</em> need to do is ask someone who lives it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:650px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.31%;"><img id="xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR" name="cell-tower.jpg" alt="5g cell tower" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xGqFpYcd7w9T5gqsuDbEBR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="650" height="366" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The worst thing is that there is no real solution to the problem outside of government-controlled broadband access. There aren't enough people here to justify new equipment or more cellular installations and corporations aren't going to lose money so I have better internet and more choice. I get that.</p><p>If you don't live in the U.S. or Canada you might not understand the situation: most of the people live in a small area in and around metropolitan areas. That means there are vast areas of space without enough people for companies to worry about. My provider (I'm not naming them because it's not their fault in the end) really doesn't care if it loses me or one of the few hundred others who live in my small community. They care about the apartments and city blocks filled with people who will happily pay their monthly fees to have service. That's who they <em>should</em> care about because they have no incentive to care otherwise. This is a problem that probably will never be fixed.</p><p>I'm not a Capitalist, Communist, Democrat, or a Republican. I care about what's best for my family. I don't want to see more government involvement when it comes to basic utilities and I have a good idea of what a federal broadband provider would end up turning into. There is room for government oversight in many areas — including broadband access — but restricted, censored, state-sponsored internet isn't the answer. There really is no answer other than me paying someone to cut down a bunch of trees and put <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/starlink-home-internet-review">a satellite dish on my roof</a>. I checked into that, too. End of July if I want it.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B" name="Starlink-lifestyle-lifestyle-16x9-01-08.jpg" alt="Starlink dishy" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SABvG9UwRnHW2a7UDSg49B.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4000" height="2250" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Chris Wedel/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's starting to feel like I need to make a choice. I can stay here where the air is clean, the neighbors are friendly enough to leave each other alone, and the fishing is to die for. Or I can pack up and leave, heading somewhere where my technology-focused career is better nurtured. I wish I could say to hell with it all and go back to wiring houses like I did when I was 20. Life was a lot easier and the money was good enough to pay my way through school. That can't happen because construction sites are notoriously wheelchair-unfriendly. I'm not sure what to do at this point; spending the day sitting in my chair at a sticky <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/mcdonalds-google-cloud-ask-pickles-partnership">McDonald's table</a> isn't my first choice though.</p><p>You <strong>can't</strong> do anything to help even if you want to help. I don't mean me and my situation, which will work itself out by the end of next week. But about the problem as a whole. But you do need to be aware of it and be a little skeptical the next time some agency or a company tells you how they're serving millions more people across rural America. The real problems are where there aren't millions of people in the first place, but there are enough people that need someone to give a damn.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The camera is at the heart of this transformation,” the company explained.</p><p>“More than just a tool for capturing images, coupled with enhanced AI-powered features, the Galaxy camera is now part of the intuitive interface that turns what users see into understanding and action.”</p><p>The company also adds that these cameras will easily adapt to the users' needs and make capturing moments more personal and seamless, with the power of AI.</p><hr><h2 id="galaxy-watch-8-shows-renders-show-up-online-2">Galaxy Watch 8 shows renders show up online</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-base-model-render-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the base Galaxy Watch 8 suggests it will receive a simpler, cleaner squircle design with two physical buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-clean-simple-squircle-ultra-redesign-leak"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leaked-on-ebay"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 leaks keep getting better.  This week, leaked renders of the alleged watch showed up online, giving us a good idea of what the actual device might look like.</p><p>The renders suggested that the Galaxy Watch 8 would show up with a squircle design, as seen in previous leaks as well. The renders of the device show the wearable in a sleeker design, with white straps, a square-ish silver base, and its circular watch face on top. The Watch 8 is speculated to have only two physical buttons and come in two sizes.</p><p>Additionally, someone ended up uploading pictures of the alleged Galaxy Watch 8 Classic on eBay. In the listing, the smartwatch is seen with a leather strap, a circular (more squircle) design, with a prominent crown sitting between two buttons. The speakers are also seen on one side of the smartwatch. The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to show up with a steel or titanium finish.</p><hr><h2 id="the-week-of-outages-2">The week of outages</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD" name="Google-services.jpg" alt="Google apps in a single folder on the home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tuQYXxoSqvEvidENdSunFD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/theres-a-massive-chatgpt-outage-maybe-its-time-to-switch-over-to-gemini"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-spotify-amazon-and-more-hit-by-a-widespread-outage-impacting-thousands"><strong>here</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p>This week saw outages on several online platforms, beginning with ChatGPT on June 10, where users experienced a massive 12-hour outage.

They give you a lot for $129. Let’s talk about the hardware first! I’ll address the app in a bit.</p><p>The Liberty 5 are the successor to the Liberty 4 NC, but they do contain <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/soundcore-liberty-4-pro-review" target="_blank">elements of the Liberty 4 Pro</a>. Aesthetically, the first thing you’ll notice is that the case looks and slides like the Liberty 4 Pro, minus the in-case display and touch bar. Slide the lid up, and you get a pairing button inside.</p><p>Below that, on the lip of the bottom half, you’ll find a light bar that indicates battery and connection status but is difficult to see outdoors, even in overcast sunlight. The case charges via USB-C and Qi wireless connections and has a matte finish that resists fingerprints very well, in contrast to the fingerprint magnet that is the Liberty 4 Pro.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-buds.JPG" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 earbuds. out of their case" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BC9LnV2ZURSAzBWY9vhxNJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Pop the earbuds out of the case, and you’ll find the same stem-style buds found in the previous generation, along with the clicky stem-based controls. In my couple of weeks with the earbuds, those controls took a bit of getting used to, but once I did, they were reliable and didn’t give me any false triggering issues when adjusting or readjusting them during exercise.</p><p>With the Liberty 5 earbuds, you’ll have five additional ear tips to choose from (shown in the gallery above). I used the default ear tips (mediums), which worked fine. Adjusting the seal of the right ear with the small gave me a better fit, so I stuck with that configuration for the remainder of my review period.</p><p>I appreciate that the white ear tips have a barely visible marking on them, indicating the size, so if you want to switch, you immediately know what you had in and which option you may want to try next.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:827px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.43%;"><img id="nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-device-setup" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Google setup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nEnSUCJGxiVsxT3Rs2g5MK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="827" height="1856" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-home" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app home screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fxqaixe2f2r7sWrvXRKAKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-settings" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 Soundcore app, more settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMGS7TfwWFdhBJaFn2iyKK.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-ldac" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app Sound Mode settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/V2chFyqZGXuRRxRJJ8Wsv6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The app is highly customizable, featuring an 8-band EQ and 22 preset options, as well as the ability to create custom presets tailored to your hearing preferences.</p><p>There’s a gaming mode, the ability to switch between AAC and LDAC playback, and the option to adjust the strength of the ANC.

The 4 Pro presented a relatively balanced stereo image out of the box. The Liberty 5, on the other hand, are bass-heavy throughout most of the default sound profiles offered. If you’re a bass lover, this may not be bad, but it isn’t optimal and doesn’t present the full sonic image that the Liberty 5 can produce.</p><p>Overall, I’d characterize the default sound as having a very warm bottom in the upper bass with a lighter sub-bass punch. Mids are scooped, and highs are bright but compete with the amped lows.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-preference" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings Preference Test" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PifebBBT2Xbzn6R3UVtRAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-hearID" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings HearID" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DQNB6DjCdw4yYngUxkGADe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-EQ-8band" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings 8-band EQ" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtQzm529zYrvz6jN8fQCAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:224.44%;"><img id="yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-app-cancellation-levels" alt="Soundcore Liberty 5 app settings ANC levels customization" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yTxnMmi6qqwkhR7cwNbZAe.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="2424" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Once you’ve connected your Liberty 5 and you dive into the app, you’ll find two different sound options that allow you to better tailor the output: Preference Test and HearID Sound Test. Preference tailors sound based on perception, while HearID tailors sound based on your level of hearing loss, if any.</p><p>I prefer HearID over the Preference Test because it compensates for hearing loss across the audible frequency spectrum, so your EQ will be “true.” Once I updated my HearID test, something I hadn’t done in 12 months, and made a couple of small tweaks to the Preference Test settings, the sound quality was much more balanced and nuanced.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG" name="anker-soundcore-liberty-5-in-ear-alt" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 5 shown being worn by the reviewer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CSLnxtUF3PHSvsNH9EQRKG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With my sonic profile preferences sorted, I hit my DSF files and played one of my “go-tos” for testing nuance: Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Something.” The intro has backing vocals that get lost with less capably tuned earbuds and headphones, but the Liberty 5 reproduced those vocals and the nuance in that track with aplomb.</p><p>The same can be said for the high-bitrate PCM Marvin Gaye files I listened to. Looking at the Developer Options menu on my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>, confirming that I was streaming “Trouble Man” and “Ain’t Nothing Like The Real Thing,” using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained" target="_blank">LDAC at 32bits/96kHz</a>, the experience was very satisfying.</p><p>Gaye’s arrangements are orchestral and expertly mastered, imparting a beautiful sense of space and nuanced instrumentation that is robust in its basslines and highs. His vocals and falsetto are top-tier, so much of that can get lost with a lesser pair of earbuds. Not the case with these. His vocals are bright and full of texture, as are Tammi Terrell’s, and the combination of their voices on that duet, presented through these earbuds, is immersive and highly entertaining.</p><p>Every other genre I threw at the Liberty 5 was well represented. The Liberty 5 proves to be a capable pair of relatively inexpensive Bluetooth earbuds that are sonically proficient with everything from speed metal to hip-hop to film scores and soundtracks.</p><p>Mic quality is clear, but on some calls, it sounded like I was in a closet. In one of my Discord chats, I left a nearly three-minute voice message for the group and listened to it back.

My go-to choice right now is the Xiaomi Buds 5 Pro, but I've been using Bose's QuietComfort Ultra for close to a month now, and they've been incredible.</p><p>The QuietComfort Ultra aren't affordable by any measure; they <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-World-Class-Cancellation/dp/B0CD2FSRDD">retail for $299 on Amazon</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-true-wireless-noise-cancelling-in-ear-earbuds-lunar-blue/6589910.p?skuId=6589910">Best Buy</a>, and that's $100 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM5-Bluetooth-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B0C33XXS56">more than the Sony WF-1000XM5</a> (which are on sale from their $299 retail). Annoyingly, Bose's earbuds miss out on niceties like wireless charging, which is available on most $100 models these days. The case is on the bulkier side as well, and while it is still pocketable, I don't get why it's so much bigger than most other products in this category.</p><p>Thankfully, that's about the only drawback I've had with the QuietComfort Ultra; these earbuds combine a great fit with a fabulous bass-heavy sound signature, and they easily connect to two devices at once. The best part is that with Snapdragon Sound integration, you can unlock higher-quality streams — if you've got a phone that also has the requisite codecs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2hy7wUhkYg4ho5adkUnqwe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I used the QuietComfort Ultra with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> as the phone comes with Snapdragon Sound as well, and it was a good pairing.

The distinctive design with a bulbous shell makes the buds highly comfortable to wear, and while you don't get as secure a fit as the buds don't nestle into your ear cavity quite as much, I didn't have any problems doing chores around the house with these on.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue" name="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gboYghvM9ZtrNNT6irvMue.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Connectivity is via Bluetooth 5.3, and the earbuds have Google Fast Pair, so it was easy to connect to various devices.

This appearance was likely for its rumored chip, which the leak claims is MediaTek's Dimensity 9400 Plus SoC. Strangely, the publication reports the tablet scored "lower than smartphones" with MediaTek's flagship chip.</p><p>The Geekbench listing reportedly states the S11 Ultra achieved a score of 5,312 in its multi-core test and 1,420 in the single-core run.</p><p>There were some smaller specs posted in the listing, like the existence of Android 16 and 12GB of RAM. Still no word on its internal storage; however, there's a chance Samsung could pop 256GB in it to match that 12GB of RAM, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review">Tab S10 Ultra</a>.</p><h2 id="an-ultra-look-2">An Ultra Look</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR" name="samsung-galaxy-tab-s10-ultra-review-2" alt="Samsung Galaxy Tab S10 Ultra with Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZiF5VenkRAyDpiGd4oPaaR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra leaks bring new information forward while <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/galaxy-tab-s11-ultra-battery-specifications-leak">also switching up the narrative</a> on a key specification: its SoC of choice. In a previous leak, the tablet was rumored to receive MediaTek's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek-announces-dimensity-9400-flagship-chip">Dimensity 9400</a> SoC from late last year. This chip was the company's flagship response to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite. However, what this alleged Geekbench listing purports is the brand's updated (and upgraded) variant.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9400-plus-soc-launch">Dimensity 9400 Plus</a> offers a Big Core design with one Arm Cortex-X925 core at 3.73GHz. The company was adamant during its launch that this chip could "propel" users' experience with Android UX. What's more, the chip is paired with the 12-core Arm Immortalis-G925 GPU for "PC-like" graphical features on Android phones.</p><p>The SoC launched in April, and it seems Samsung could opt for this leveled-up version of MediaTek's flagship prowess.</p><p>Other Galaxy Tab S11 series rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab/samsung-galaxy-tab-s11-s10-lite-device-rumors">will drop the Plus model in 2025</a>, bringing back its base model, which was absent last year. While the base model could see a familiar 8,160mAh battery, the Ultra model might jump 500mAh to ~11,374mAh.</p><p>Speculation claims Samsung might hold onto its next flagship tablet series until after its summer Unpacked. This means we might not see them until the fall at the latest.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Tablet deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/ipad-tablets-ereaders/tablets/pcmcat209000050008.c?id=pcmcat209000050008"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=tablet"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/tablets-laptops-computers-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=tablet&crid=2HCFROTF588S1&sprefix=tablet%2Caps%2C159&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us/search/tablet"><u><strong>Dell</strong></u></a><strong></strong></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Google states this alternative overview is said to leverage the latest Gemini models for "quick, conversational" results for "certain" queries. Google remains confident that this feature (in testing) can help users understand information with convenience.</p><p>After searching, it seems Google's Audio Overviews in Search will appear as an option for users to receive. The post states testers will notice a "generate" button if the feature is available for that particular query.</p><p>If you opt into it, Audio Overviews will be housed in their own contained space within your results. Marked by a "Search Labs" experience label, the overview will inform users about what it entails. For example, users would see a "Listen to..." starter, followed by whatever the topic is you've searched for, like noise cancellation in headphones.</p><p>Following that is the Audio Overview itself, with a play button and how long Google's AI will be speaking about the subject. Similar to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-ai-overviews-year-later-research-report">Search's regular AI Overviews</a>, users will see citations detailing where the model got its information. There will be a small label highlighting the number of websites, as well as a horizontal, scrollable carousel of those sites.</p><h2 id="merging-the-google-ai-experience-2">Merging the Google AI Experience</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:580px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:103.45%;"><img id="YuE9VG5ZLZD4QUnkcSKLie" name="google-search-audio-overviews-test" alt="Google's AI Search Labs brings "Audio Overviews" to users, which displays its own section with a clickable audio file for bite-sized information from Gemini." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YuE9VG5ZLZD4QUnkcSKLie.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="580" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Since this is a Labs test, Google encourages users to offer feedback via its thumbs-up and thumbs-down buttons. Additionally, if this interests you, users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://labs.google.com/search/experiment/30">join the Search Labs experience</a> to begin trying it today (June 13).</p><p>Google's AI Overviews have continued to evolve; however, this alternative mirrors what was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/notebooklm-audio-overviews-radio-like-ai">given through NotebookLM</a>. In September, Google rolled out Audio Overviews to NotebookLM, a journal-based app that lets users go in-depth with their research/learning for better understanding. For this app, Audio Overviews utilized two AI "co-hosts" for a conversational, podcast-like creation.</p><p>One primary difference here is that NotebookLM's version leverages information contained within <em>your </em>documents. The AI tries its best to condense this information in a way that facilitates better understanding. Additionally, users can guide these AI toward specific talking points and even pose questions.</p><p>Google's version in this Search test seems restricted to the AI delivering its best version of condensed information for the user. There's a chance the company could bring similar NotebookLM features to Search, but that remains speculative for now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From the stand's blown-up render, it seems the Korean OEM has succeeded in trimming down the next book-style Fold. The device is partly open in this shot, giving us a look at each half, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6.</p><p>The foldable still retains its rounded corners on the right half of its frame. However, another point of interest is its hinge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:476px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:126.05%;"><img id="3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-promotional-thinner-photo" alt="A photo of Samsung's promotional standee for the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which appears much thinner than the Fold 6." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3HTwojuYbV4CaoxhyufQde.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="476" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Reddit)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The hinge, which can be responsible for giving a much larger size to the foldable, might've slimmed down slightly for this next iteration. With that, there's a chance that when folded, the Fold 7's displays will sit much closer together, especially toward the hinge. Typically, there's a bit of a gap there due to its functionality, but Samsung may cut this down even more than it did with its predecessor.</p><h2 id="a-foldable-summer-with-a-bigger-camera-bump-2">A Foldable Summer... with a bigger camera bump?</h2><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">galaxyfold</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge">r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>Aside from that, another GalaxyFold subreddit <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyFold/comments/1laduur/fold_7_camera_bump_is_huge/">post by a separate user</a> highlights a leaked look at an upcoming Galaxy Z Fold 7 case (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/06/13/galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-bump-leak/">9to5Google</a>). While this is a Thinborne case, the purpose of this photo is the camera bump and how large it seems to be. From the angled top view, things appear quite nominal. However, when shown the side view, the Fold 7's camera bump protrudes quite harshly from the back of the device.</p><p>There's something to note here: the Fold 7's triple camera array (in older leaked imagery) sits on an elevated island. Moreover, the leaked case's protection is likely ever-so-slightly higher than the island to protect the lenses when set down.</p><p>Either way, as the original poster notes, "The thickness of the camera bump is almost just as thick as the phone itself (in folded mode)."</p><p>Something a little more "concrete" to look at would be a recent leak from May, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/someone-got-their-hands-on-the-alleged-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-heres-the-first-look">as a user allegedly got their hands on</a> the Fold 7 early. Wrapped in plastic, the user took a photo of the device in question, showing off its triple camera array with black rings, similar to its past version, and the direction <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-hands-on">the Galaxy S25</a> has gone. It was unclear just how large Samsung's camera island for the Galaxy Z Fold 7 would be, but this latest leaked render from Reddit might've given us all we need to know.</p><p>More than that, rumors claim the Fold 7 is roughly 4.5mm when unfolded, which is a bit thinner than the Fold 6's ~5.6mm measurement.</p><p>The Fold 7 is also purported to provide a huge 200MP camera, finally moving away from 50MP. Considering the camera bump's supposed increase, these camera upgrades could be the culprit, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/pixel-design-lead-discusses-large-camera-visor">we've seen Google discuss before</a> with its Pixel 9.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Samsung’s upcoming foldables, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Phone deals: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/top-deals/cell-phone-deals/pcmcat1563302848653.c?id=pcmcat1563302848653"><u><strong>Best Buy</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/cell-phones/1105910?povid=web_globalnav_cellphones_shop_all"><u><strong>Walmart</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/shop/all-deals/cell-phone-deals/"><u><strong>Samsung</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=cell+phone&crid=19CKV7OMEPEMF&sprefix=cell+phone%2Caps%2C222&ref=nb_sb_noss_1"><u><strong>Amazon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Although "smarter" watches and wearables replaced the brand, founder Eric Migicovsky is bringing the concept back under a new company called Core Devices. Roughly a half-year <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/hell-yeah-theyre-bringing-pebble-watches-back">after Migicovsky first announced his plans</a>, the refreshed Core 2 Duo watch is about to start shipping to customers and a new app is on the way.</p><p>In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ericmigi.com/blog/core-2-duo-alphabeta-test-signup" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Migicovsky confirms that Core Devices has already built 200 units of the Core 2 Duo watch, and it's nearing mass production. The company is on track to ship all pre-orders for the Core 2 Duo in July and August, and some beta testers will get their orders early. The Core Time 2 is a bit further out from mass production and shipping, but Migicovsky says it's still on schedule, with engineering samples slated for next month.</p><p>As part of the "RePebble" project, Google generously open-sourced PebbleOS, helping make the entire endeavor possible. That doesn't just benefit buyers of new Core Devices products, but also existing Pebble users and at-home tinkerers. Anyone can play around with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://github.com/coredevices/pebbleos" target="_blank">PebbleOS on GitHub</a>. More importantly, Migicovsky's reboot may give new life to people who still have a working Pebble watch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2037px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K" name="pebble-core-duo-2-time-2-smartwatches-hero" alt="A rendering depicting Core Devices' new PebbleOS smartwatches: the Core 2 Duo and the Time 2." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8UnRaxseeEikjEUVcfHW9K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2037" height="1146" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Core Devices)</span></figcaption></figure><p>"You can join the test even if you didn’t pre-order a Core 2 Duo," Migicovsky writes, "if you have an old working Pebble Time (Steel/Round) or Pebble 2 watch, you can join the beta to help test the new iOS and Android mobile app."</p><p>"Our new app works with your old Pebble!"</p><p>Users can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forms.gle/iRK9MoW8v7th5RVHA" target="_blank">sign up for the beta test here</a>, but be warned, Migicovsky says this project is only for people willing to avoid public criticism and provide detailed reports and feedback. "This is actually going to be a lot of fun (for the right person)," he writes. "I just want to make sure we're on the same page."</p><p>For people with a Core 2 Duo pre-order, expect an email confirmation this month to work out the final shipping details for your order. That includes providing a shipping address and "to pay duties/tariffs/taxes for your country." As of now, it seems Core Devices' Pebble refresh is close to becoming a reality.</p><p>You can pre-order a Core Devices watch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.repebble.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature is wrapped in Google's recent stretch of June <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500">Google System Release patches</a>, specifically for its Play Services. The company details this as a "Safety & Emergency" update, stating Wear OS users will soon see alerts "when an earthquake is expected."</p><p>Rahman reiterates that Google's been working on this for a few months now, after a teardown surfaced a few details.</p><p>According to the post, these earthquake alerts on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS devices</a> will display the quake's "magnitude" and "estimated distance to the epicenter." Users should, of course, take this information seriously if it ever happens and take the appropriate action to ensure their safety. Moreover, it seems Google is putting a blanket over every Wear OS user, bringing this feature to more than just "high-risk" areas, as it has done before on Android.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google's Play Services update for June includes a few bug fixes related to its Wallet app and developer updates for "Account Management" in apps. Google's changelog announced this safety feature last week, but it appears to be rolling out very slowly.</p><h2 id="ahead-of-danger-2">Ahead of Danger</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj" name="Pixel-Watch-3-trekking-poles" alt="The Google Pixel Watch 3 sitting atop a pair of trekking poles, with the watch face including a step count of 11,800." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XG9XJmxDfFGvgxPD5c2bWj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google first launched its Earthquake Alerts System back in 2020 and expanded its access <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-earthquake-alerts-system-expands-greece-new-zealand">to more countries in 2021</a>. Essentially, the system turns your phone into a portable seismometer using its accelerometer to detect changes in the planet. The information your phone detects is sent to Google's servers, which are then "crowdsourced" with other Android phones to see if a quake is truly happening.</p><p>If confirmed, Google's system will alert all Android users within the quake's range to get to safety.

You could even make the purchase through Affirm to pay $30 per month for the phone-and-service bundle.

Both offers are exceptional, but having my phone bill covered for a year sounds too good to pass up. </p><p>The problem is that some folks may not want to commit to a single data plan for two years.

This is where we'll likely see the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7, Galaxy Watch 8, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/samsung-project-moohan-hands-on-apple-vision-pro-rival">Project Moohan</a> (likely) or a Galaxy Ring 2 (less likely). Needless to say, Unpacked is going to be packed to the gills.</p><p>I can't help but notice that Samsung's messaging to this point has largely been focused on the larger Galaxy foldable. It started with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-drops-a-swift-tease-for-a-potential-z-fold-ultra">teaser</a>, showcasing a silhouette of a book-style foldable, accompanied by a caption reading "Meet the next chapter of Ultra." Then, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-promises-sleek-durable-galaxy-z-series-incoming">blog post</a> was published that focuses on how the unknown device is "Thin, Light, and Built to Last."</p><p>The most recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-teases-ai-camera-with-situational-awareness-for-galaxy-z-fold-7-ultra">teaser</a> focuses on the camera system and how AI is expected to improve, arguably the most frustrating aspect of the previous model. Given the constant flow of features from Google, courtesy of tools like Gemini Live, I would expect this to be the case.</p><h2 id="the-lack-of-confidence-is-evident-2">The lack of confidence is evident</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-8.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 on cobblestone road" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2LxkjTPus64c9bXU2eztuB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>However, a recent report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.thelec.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=36892">The Elec</a> suggests Samsung has lowered its projected sales figures for both the Z Fold 7 and Z Flip 7. The report notes that in May alone, Samsung was expected to produce approximately 1.6 million units, with the Fold 7 accounting for 800,000 units. Now, that figure has reportedly been lowered to around 1.34 million devices, with the Fold 7 dropping to around 630,000 units.</p><p>Assuming the report is correct, which should always be taken with a grain of salt, I'm left wondering what's going on. For one, I don't recall the last time Samsung started building this much hype for its foldable phones ahead of an official announcement, at least not with this kind of cadence.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:60.00%;"><img id="bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-series-gif" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 7 teaser" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bWHFWV8EWSvYqs6RX48iLZ.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, why is Samsung trying to hype a product that it reportedly expects to fall short of its targets? The obvious answer is that Samsung could just be hoping to exceed expectations for the first time in years. But to me, something about the whole situation just doesn't sit right.</p><p>Could Samsung actually introduce a Galaxy Z Fold Ultra? I doubt it. There are numerous factors that work against this idea, particularly in the context of the ongoing trade and tariff dispute in the United States. Furthermore, the economic climate in this region is far too volatile, and an "Ultra" foldable would likely surpass the $2,000 mark, making it out of reach for many.</p><h2 id="falling-behind-2">Falling behind</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4" name="OPPO Find N5" alt="OPPO Find N5 next to Galaxy Z Fold 6" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7jwzkz8wDPWgfTrWxwfqq4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No matter what comes of the 2025 Galaxy Z Fold family, if it doesn't meet Samsung's expectations, they really only have themselves to blame. Although the software experience is as great as it gets compared to the competition, Samsung has fallen far behind in the design department.</p><p>Other foldable phones, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review" target="_blank">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review" target="_blank">Oppo Find N5</a>, and even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-magic-v3-long-term-review" target="_blank">Honor Magic V3,</a> make the Galaxy Z Fold 6 look a few years older than it actually is. Not to mention that both of those devices offer better camera hardware, bigger batteries, and less noticeable creases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-15.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold inner screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n2Z8YQi3u6AvPaiK8xDsFM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung is quick to point and laugh at Apple, but it's also one of the first to follow in Apple's footsteps. This is exactly what happened with the Fold lineup, as Samsung only made minor tweaks to the hardware, resulting in a phone that didn't look much different from the one before it.</p><p>Instead of being the industry leader it should be, Samsung sat back and coasted for too long, and the people responded with their wallets. Proof of that came <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-9-pro-fold-a-crowd-favorite-in-europe">via Counterpoint Research</a>, which reported that Samsung "saw a 24% drop in sales in Q1 this year."</p><h2 id="what-about-a-galaxy-fold-fe-2">What about a Galaxy Fold FE?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review-12.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 with Z Fold 5 and Fold 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bgGzMBiUX8b7cH9Tj5kZaM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there's the potential for Samsung to launch a cheaper Galaxy Z Fold FE to boost sales.

Samsung hasn't proven that it can make a foldable that keeps pace with the Oppo Find N5 or Pixel 9 Pro Fold. Software-wise, yes, the Fold 6 is the clear winner.

Recently, Nothing's CEO Carl Pei sat down with the folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/12/nothings-new-phone-3-will-be-available-for-general-sale-in-the-us/">TechCrunch</a> to discuss the phone's availability, specifically in the North American region.</p><p>Speaking to the publication, Pei pointed out that the company always had plans to bring the new flagship model to the U.S. "We have always said we are building for the long term, and now we’re ready to take that next step in the U.S. Phone (3) is not just another launch. It is a signal of where we are as a company," he added.</p><p>As for the availability of the device, the publication notes that, Phone 3 will support AT&T and T-Mobile coverage in the U.S. with multi-band support for 4G and 5G — broadening its carrier compatibility from its previous models. The Nothing Phone 3 will also be sold via the company's website and on Amazon.</p><p>Additionally, TechCrunch mentions, Nothing is partnering with Best Buy to sell its new flagship, along with its first-ever over-ear headphone model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-will-launch-its-first-over-the-ear-headphones-in-july-along-with-phone-3">Headphone 1</a>, that is set to launch on July 1 as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ" name="Nothing-phone-2a-with-phone-1-and-phone-2.jpg" alt="Holding the Nothing Phone (2a) with Nothing Phone (1) and Nothing Phone (2) in the background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MsFtAuSCJMHPvqVyYTVpQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Nothing's flagship phones have been somewhat difficult to obtain in the U.S. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phone-1-hands-on-preview-impressions" target="_blank">Phone 1</a> was not officially released for general sale in the U.S., but was made available through a "Beta Membership" program.

Pei replied, saying "100%," with the American flag emoji next to it.</p><p>Furthermore, the publication stated that the company saw a significant number of users switching from other brands to Nothing, which is why it plans to intensify efforts to attract even more North American customers. Pei added that the U.S. smartphone market is dominated by two players (likely Samsung and Apple), and that people are seeking a change from this norm.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Come to Play.Phone (3). 1 July, 18:00 BST. pic.twitter.com/9afIpKao1s<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1929870704968606029">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nothing phones are known for their distinctive design, including the customizable Glyph Interface and transparent elements, which set them apart from most other major smartphones on the market.

If you've got an eligible Pixel (Pixel 6 and above), you can install Android 16 right now, and while it is short on exciting new features — those are coming later this year — it brings plenty of usability changes.</p><p>With Android 16 behind us, Google is hard at work on Android 17. While we don't know what features will end up in the next iteration of Android, we can make several guesses — Google omitted features in the stable Android 16 build that showed up in the beta, and there's a good likelihood that these will end up in Android 17.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-codename"><span>Android 17 codename</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bhbnqR836Prgab3a3nfy8X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google doesn't have dessert codenames — that ended with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-10-review-one-year-later-oneui-oxygenos-miui-coloros">Android 10</a> — but it still uses internal codenames with Android releases. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> was Upside Down Cake, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-15">Android 15</a> was Vanilla Ice Cream, and with Android 16, Google switched back to Baklava, so if it maintains a consistent naming scheme, Android 17 will likely be something around C, so we could get cheesecake or chocolate bar.</p><p>These things leak well in advance, so we don't have to wait too long to know more about the codename or release details.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-features"><span>Android 17 features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X" name="Android 16" alt="Android 16 review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DiDNbkVmw8rcHpXSwjhu9X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We are well past the point where new Android versions get groundbreaking features; the goal with every new version update is to bring tweaks to security and privacy features, and deliver usability changes that make a difference in daily use. That said, Google just showcased a bold new design language with Android 16, dubbed Material 3 Expressive.</p><p>There's just one problem — Material 3 Expressive isn't launching until Q4 2025 on Pixels, and that means other devices will miss out on the UI overhaul at least until Android 17. That is if manufacturers like Samsung, OPPO, Vivo, and Xiaomi even bother to integrate the design aesthetic.</p><p>That wasn't the case with Material You on these devices; while these brands used some features like the dynamic color picker, they broadly retained their distinct visual styling in lieu of the vibrant hues of Google's design. While it would be great to see a Vivo phone with a UI similar to that of a Pixel, that just isn't going to be possible.</p><p>We should get a better idea of the features in the coming weeks, but Android 17 should get better protections against local internet access and factory reset. Google showcased these features this year, but they didn't make it to Android 16, so it's a good bet that they're going to debut next year.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-android-17-release-date"><span>Android 17 release date</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="kpwXQ7avAaS9vB9H8gVcVP" name="pixel-9-9-pro-xl-3.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL beside Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kpwXQ7avAaS9vB9H8gVcVP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google switched up its Android strategy with Android 16; instead of releasing the stable build at the end of Q3 or early Q4, it introduced the release in Q2. Ostensibly, this is to ensure that devices launching in the fall — including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> — debut with the latest Android build instead of getting the update later in the year.</p><p>In addition to that, Google is releasing a secondary Android update that will come out in Q4, dubbed the minor release. It's clear that this is the path the search giant is taking with Android in general, and we should see initial Android 17 builds sometime in the month of November 2025. That was the case last year with Android 16, and there's no reason to suggest Google would alter its timeline with Android 17.</p><p>Obviously, we're light on details regarding Android 17 at the moment, but that will change over the coming weeks as Google details its plans.</p> ]]></dc:content>

They cost $400 bundled with the Smart Tx transmitter, or $350 if you want to leave it out. Both should see price drops within 12 months, and JBL sometimes leaves certain legacy products in its inventory for longer periods. They come in black, blue, and mocha.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-what-s-good"><span>JBL Tour One M3: What's good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kSN5bfAsVRp2mQdLJZSk49" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-wearing" alt="Wearing the JBL Tour One M3 view from the side." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kSN5bfAsVRp2mQdLJZSk49.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Buying guides</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/summer-travel-guide-2025-headphones-earbuds"><strong>Best headphones to travel with</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones"><strong>Best wireless headphones</strong></a><strong></strong></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones"><strong>Best noise-cancelling headphones</strong></a><strong></strong></p></div></div><p>Headphones starting at $350-$400 need to be good at several things: sound, noise cancellation, comfort, personalization, and battery life, among others. The JBL Tour One M3 have the comfort part down pat. Wearing them for hours on multiple flights, I would never feel constrained or like I had to give my ears some air. The soft cushioning on both the ear cups and headband is JBL's staple at this point, but I’m happy to report they’ve been thoughtfully put together here.</p><p>The included case is also nicely designed with a large pouch on the other inner side to make room for the cables, though I had more success laying the Smart Tx transmitter in an open space next to the headphones (and keeping from losing it). The Tour One M3 fold flat to accommodate this, with the overall benefit being that they take up less room when traveling or commuting with them. That’s definitely one thing I can attest to on my travels.</p><p>There’s also an adaptability factor here that I think you might appreciate as well. The Smart Tx transmitter plays multiple roles and is very much a carryover from JBL’s premium wireless earbuds, like the Tour Pro 3, whose cases have built-in LCD screens. As a transmitter, the Smart Tx is easy to plug into an airliner’s entertainment screen to enjoy wireless playback.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MSRM9mEjBZeMhkBuxHJq29" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-Smart-Tx" alt="Smart Tx transmitter showing spatial audio settings for JBL Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MSRM9mEjBZeMhkBuxHJq29.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Using the included USB-C-to-3.5mm cable, I just plug the Smart Tx into the system, and it passes through all audio to the Tour One M3 headphones. I actually kind of laughed when I walked over to a nearby restroom and could still hear the show I was watching. The only downside is that I had to leave the transmitter dangling from the Aux-In port on the screen. It can also work with TVs and older stereo systems that don’t have Bluetooth connectivity, only without the benefit of having it within arm’s reach.</p><p>Previous Tour One models have 3.5mm inputs, except JBL removed it from the M3. That makes the transmitter more useful in cases where Bluetooth isn’t a built-in option. It also means, however, that you can’t use a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) with a 3.5mm input in case you want to give audio a boost that way — though you certainly can via USB-C, so it’s not a total loss.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="LuS3C4iiwh8xwzCUwHkYt8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-screenshots-1" alt="Screenshots showing JBL Headphones app with Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LuS3C4iiwh8xwzCUwHkYt8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, JBL approaches sound in a few different ways. By any standard, JBL’s Headphones app is one of the most comprehensive I’ve seen, largely due to the level of customization it offers. I recommend going through these options first because the Tour One M3 hit a different sonic stride when you do. The equalizer offers decent presets, along with the ability to create your own.</p><p>Personi-Fi is a hearing test that adjusts the overall sound profile to enhance the highs, mids, and lows based on the results, leading to what should be a noticeable difference. The catch is that you need to pay close attention in a quiet space while taking the test, as you must press and hold, releasing only when you stop hearing the beep. If you’re off too much on this, it can throw off the sound a fair bit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="AoCxEpFdjuzBiei5jyYwr8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-screenshots-2" alt="Screenshots showing audio customization for JBL Tour One M3." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AoCxEpFdjuzBiei5jyYwr8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>My first go round boosted treble way too high to my right ear, so I did it again and got a corrected result that sounds great. The beauty of this is that it’s so subjective; those with hearing loss can also benefit from personalized sound that suits them rather than a uniform sound signature all must accept.</p><p>The resulting sound profile applies regardless of what you’re listening to or the mode you use, whether it's an equalizer preset or Spatial Sound (fixed or head tracking). The one exception is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC hi-res Bluetooth codec</a>. Turn that on, and it disables both Personi-Fi and Spatial Sound. It also annoyingly forces the headphones to reboot.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="k8DBtwFnEqjSPrtRW7xv69" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-close-up" alt="Close-up view of the JBL Tour One M3 right earcup." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/k8DBtwFnEqjSPrtRW7xv69.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A further boost to the audio experience is surprisingly robust and effective active noise cancellation (ANC). It’s not that JBL has a bad reputation for snuffing out background noise; it’s just that the Tour One M3 feel like a major step forward in consistency. Wearing them on a long flight, I couldn’t hear much of anything around me, save for the faded cries of a nearby baby. The only time I knew the crew made an announcement was when my screen said so. Even in a busy street environment or at work, the ANC shines.</p><p>JBL also offers some custom choices, letting you decide the noise cancellation level and whether you want the onboard microphones to make the call based on surrounding noise through Adaptive ANC. While they won’t unseat Sony or Bose’s best, the Tour One M3 suddenly look like upstarts worthy of being in the conversation among them. Another significant reason is the comfortable fit and passive isolation that the cups provide.</p><div><blockquote><p>Smart Talk lets you determine how long audio volume lowers once you start talking.</p></blockquote></div><p>This makes it easier to immerse yourself in a show or movie as well. Video mode reduces the Bluetooth latency to an acceptable level for audio-video sync. It’s not perfect, mind you, but I didn’t really feel like it was off all that much, and stopped noticing after a while. Even Spatial Sound gives you the choice to switch between music, movies, and gaming to take advantage of the virtual surround effect.</p><p>Ambient Aware is also very effective, but I particularly like TalkThru as a means to keep some of the background noise down while still conversing with someone. Smart Talk lets you determine how long the audio volume lowers once you start talking. This way, you can briefly chat with someone without having to pause first. Wear sensors will automatically pause playback when you take them off (although with a slight delay), resuming again when you put them back on. Multipoint support also means you can keep them paired with two devices simultaneously.</p><div><blockquote><p>There are numerous modes and features that can immerse you or keep you engaged in a conversation.</p></blockquote></div><p>Phone calls are also solid — and again — what feels like a big step forward as well. Callers didn’t realize I was talking to them hands-free through headphones. In case you find it’s not enough, JBL offers a couple of boosting options for that, too.</p><p>Onboard controls are a hybrid of physical and touch buttons. Pressing the action button cycles between ANC and Ambient Aware (or both off, if you prefer), while a double-click toggles TalkThru on and off. Touch controls are on the right earcup, where a simple tap plays/pauses, a double tap skips a track, a triple tap repeats one, and holding activates your phone’s voice assistance. For calls, double taps answer incoming calls and end ongoing calls, while holding rejects an incoming call or toggles mute on or off. All of them work pretty seamlessly, though you have no way to customize them as you want.</p><p>Battery life is great, lasting over 50 hours without issue. Volume levels will affect that number, but that’s pretty much the over/under for these cans. All told, it’s some of the best battery life you’ll find at this price, beating out Sony and Bose by a huge margin.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-smart-tx-transmitter"><span>JBL Tour One M3: Smart Tx transmitter</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Ja66NQhR2m5d3eKv2KX69" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-Auracast" alt="Smart Tx transmitter for JBL Tour One M3 showing Auracast mode." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Ja66NQhR2m5d3eKv2KX69.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024"><strong>I finally tried Auracast, and it feels like Bluetooth's final form</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/ask-jerry-can-auracast-help-me"><strong>Ask Jerry: Can Auracast help me?</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/how-to-use-bluetooth-audio-sharing-on-google-pixel"><strong>How to use Bluetooth audio sharing on a Google Pixel phone</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Before I move on, I have to revisit the Smart Tx transmitter again because of what it represents. Much like the app, the device gives you a lot of control over the Tour One M3 and their features, directly from the touchscreen. However, its most significant value proposition is support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/i-tried-bluetooth-auracast-at-ifa-2024">Auracast</a>. While hardly a standard feature on Bluetooth audio devices today, it looks to be in the near future.</p><p>When active, it can transmit the signal to any other pair of headphones or earbuds supporting Auracast. You have the option to set up a four-digit passcode to ward off unwanted listeners, but the advantages are pretty numerous.</p><p>For instance, you and a loved one can watch the same content from the same single device wirelessly on a plane, or even utilize the excellent onboard microphones to chat with someone on a video call. Plugging into a TV offers a similar scenario, especially if you each prefer to listen at different volumes.</p><p>The catch remains broader compatibility for Auracast among everyday devices and in public spaces, but it’s something these headphones have over many others for now. It will definitely come in handy when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/samsung-and-gn-showcase-auracasts-potential-for-enhanced-hearing-accessibility">Auracast rolls out in more places</a> and on more devices.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-what-s-not-good"><span>JBL Tour One M3: What's not good</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mJQLCXqV8FZCg8wARLZ7z8" name="JBL-Tour-One-M3-buttons" alt="View of buttons and controls on JBL Tour One M3 earcups." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mJQLCXqV8FZCg8wARLZ7z8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This isn’t so much a criticism as it is a realization that JBL all but forces you to tinker with the sound profile right away. Your ears may feel different out of the box, though I’d bet that most will feel like something’s missing. Discovering what the Tour One M3 are truly capable of almost feels like unpacking a different pair after the fact.</p><p>That’s a saving grace because it would be a real shame if these, after doing so much right, faltered badly on that front. You may feel like the app is “busy” with all the settings and modes, but trust me, the customization is worth exploring. JBL clearly intends for these expensive cans to be versatile, so you might as well get your money’s worth by making them feel like they’re especially working for you.</p><div><blockquote><p>Despite its usefulness, the Smart Tx transmitter can be a divisive component to all this.</p></blockquote></div><p>That’s why the Smart Tx transmitter can be a divisive component to all this. It’s definitely nifty and cool to use, yet also small and potentially easy to misplace or lose. Additionally, it has its own battery, so you must be mindful of charging it as well. Sadly, it doesn’t have app support or storage, which would be great for storing offline music and keeping your phone away during a workout or run, for instance.</p><p>Auracast may also feel like something you don’t need, but I suspect you will feel differently once you experience it. Even without Auracast enabled, the transmitter is a handy tool to have for those situations. It’s just that you’re paying extra (money and attention) for the convenience.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-jbl-tour-one-m3-competition"><span>JBL Tour One M3: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1668px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="2bbZo3XvhmiB79ppk4EBtG" name="sony-wh-1000xm6-noise-cancelling-hero" alt="Sony's newest noise-cancelling headphones in silver, black, and blue." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2bbZo3XvhmiB79ppk4EBtG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1668" height="938" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sony)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I’ll readily admit I didn’t expect the JBL Tour One M3 to be this good.

Samsung skipped the Classic model last year, but it's rumored to be back for the Watch 8 series with a new design and better features. It should offer better battery life than the standard Watch 8, and the interactive bezel should prove useful when using the touchscreen is not an option.</p><p>OnePlus has an equally enticing option for less with the OnePlus Watch 3. It may be more affordable than the Watch 8 Classic, features a rotating crown with haptic feedback, and offers excellent software and impressive battery life.</p><p>If you have to decide between the rumored Galaxy Watch 8 Classic and OnePlus Watch 3, which smartwatch should you pick?

It's built extremely well and feels sturdy when you wear it. The watch case itself weighs almost 50g, so it's not the lightest on your wrist. OnePlus has given it good weather resistance with a 5ATM and IP68 ratings. You get rubber straps by default, but you can easily swap them out for any 22mm strap.</p><p>The display on the Watch 3 is incredible. It features a 1.5-inch LTPO AMOLED display with a 466 x 466 resolution and Sapphire Crystal protection. Brightness levels are also very good, reaching a peak value of up to 2,200 nits. In our review, we found the display to be one of the best aspects of the Watch 3, as it's bright enough for outdoor use and the DC-dimming doesn't create any annoying flickering for PWM-sensitive users. OnePlus has also reduced the thickness of the bezels on this iteration, which makes it nicer to use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8bfw7EPSxQXeXiJzaUP4a9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K2-scaled" alt="Two renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, one facing forward-right and the other back-left.

The Watch 8 Classic is expected to come in a single size, and this could be a 46mm or 47mm case. It should have the same AMOLED display size of 1.5 inches like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a>, along with a similar resolution of 480 x 480 pixels. Other expected specs include a brightness of at least 2,000 nits and a 60Hz refresh rate. This isn't wildly different from the OnePlus Watch 3, which means both could be evenly matched when it comes to display quality.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to feature a design similar to the Galaxy Watch Ultra, including the inclusion of a third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button" target="_blank">Quick Button</a>. Samsung's watch (and phone) designs have started to feel a bit boring lately, so this pivot to a squircle design for the casing could add some freshness and will certainly help set it apart from the crowd. It should have similar durability ratings as the OnePlus Watch 3 as well, with a 5ATM rating when submerged under fresh water and an IP68 rating.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-oneplus-watch-3-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB" name="oneplus-watch-3-bands-detached" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with the watch display on and the bands detached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WGZgTmZNP7HvmmkEasDfyB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The OnePlus Watch 3 costs $349.99 in the U.S., and it often goes on sale for a lower price. There's only one size and variant of the watch at the time of writing, which does not include LTE. Another feature that's present but doesn't work in North America is ECG.</p><p>The Watch 3 has a dual-processor system inside for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> and RTOS. There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5</a> SoC to handle Google's OS and the BES2800 MCU to power RTOS. This dual functionality is what gives the Watch 3 such amazing battery life. That, and the fact that it has a massive 631mAh battery, allowing it to last a full week on a single charge. This is something the Watch 8 Classic may not be able to keep up with, as even the Watch Ultra has a smaller battery. The Watch 3 is smooth to operate and use thanks to the 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage.</p><p>One of the main ways to judge a smartwatch's performance is to gauge the accuracy of all the data it collects. In the case of the Watch 3, Android Central's Nicholas Sutrich was very happy with its performance. In his review, he mentioned that OnePlus has greatly improved the way the watch measures your vitals even when you wear it loosely on your wrist. The results were quite impressive, comparable to those of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, which is quite notable considering the Watch 3's price.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K1-scaled" alt="Three renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like in a row, with the Classic facing left, forward, and right, each model showing a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We don't know the exact cost of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic yet, but based on the pricing of the Watch 6 Classic, we expect it to be around $450. Samsung is expected to launch Wi-Fi and LTE versions of the Classic, but it will supposedly only come in one size.</p><p>The Watch 8 Classic may continue to use the Exynos W1000 SoC from the Watch 7 series, as Samsung has been known to reuse its chips across multiple generations. We might get a tweaked version of the chip for better efficiency, but we don't expect to see any massive changes. The Watch 8 Classic will probably have 2GB of RAM, along with 32GB of storage.</p><p>As for battery capacity, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to have a 450mAh battery, so slightly larger than the standard Watch 8 (and Watch 7) but much smaller than the OnePlus Watch 3. Charging speeds will once again be either 10W or 15W, so nowhere near as quick as the Watch 3.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus Watch 3</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm (46m or 47mm)</p></td><td  ><p>46.6 x 47.6 x 11.75 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch display, exact specs unknown</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch (466x466) LTPO AMOLED, 2,200 nits brightness</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal, 5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium bezel, stainless steel case, sapphire crystal glass, MIL-STD-810H, IP68, 5ATM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>49.7g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon W5 SoC, 6nm BES2800 MCU</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Navigation & Physical Controls</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p>Digital crown, Back button</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Optical HR, SpO2, ECG, wrist temperature, accelerometer, barometer, geomagnetic, gyroscope, light sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi (dual-band), Bluetooth 5.3, LTE (optional), GPS, and NFC</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth 5.2, WiFi 2.4/5GHz, NFC</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>450mAh</p></td><td  ><p>631mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6)</p></td><td  ><p>Wear OS 5 and RTOS</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-oneplus-watch-3-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. OnePlus Watch 3: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA" name="oneplus-watch-3-green-watchface" alt="A OnePlus Watch 3 with a green watchface" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uoJGbHLooC3vBViRDtRqA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic is expected to have the latest One UI 8 Watch, which should be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

If you're not too picky about having LTE or using the ECG function in the U.S., the OnePlus Watch 3 offers incredible value. You get a great-looking watch, good health and fitness monitoring capabilities, a very good interface, and the best battery life you'll find on a watch under $400.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 8 Classic could be pricier, but it should also offer more features like AI capabilities, longer software support, and a unique design.

After skipping the Classic model with the Watch 7 series, the upcoming Watch 8 Classic is expected to resemble a blend of the standard model and the 2024 Galaxy Watch Ultra, based on leaked renders. This also means it might just compete with the Watch Ultra in terms of battery life and maybe pricing.</p><p>This begs the question: between the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8"> </a>Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra, which smartwatch offers better value?

The rough illustrations show a squircle frame with a circular display, and what looks like three buttons on the right. The Watch Ultra debuted a third <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/how-to-use-samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-quick-button">Quick Button</a>, and it appears that the Watch 8 Classic might also receive it.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/massive-galaxy-watch-8-classic-leak-all-but-confirms-its-squircle-look" target="_blank">Galaxy Watch 8 Classic render</a>, as seen above, gives us a clearer image of what we might expect the new Classic to look like. Unlike the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Watch 6 Classic</a>, which came in two sizes, the Watch 8 Classic is expected to come in a single size, and this could be a 46mm or 47mm case. It's expected to have the same AMOLED display size of 1.5 inches as the Galaxy Watch Ultra, along with a similar resolution of 480 x 480 pixels. Other expected specs include a brightness of at least 2,000 nits and a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>The rumored dimensions of the Watch 8 Classic put it at 14.2mm in thickness, which is thicker than the Watch Ultra. Samsung typically doesn't count the width of the sensor underneath, so we hope this 14.2mm measurement includes that as well. If not, the Watch 8 Classic might just end up being one of the thickest smartwatches, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/leaked-galaxy-watch-8-classic-design-is-bold-but-i-have-concerns">which can be concerning</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpg" alt="ECG on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tB2c39Gh7RymoX9CU9kKo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-review">Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> is large and imposing, weighing 60 grams and measuring 12.1mm in thickness (excluding the sensors). The design is also quite striking, as the case doesn't look like your typical smartwatch. In fact, it bears a striking resemblance to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch-ultra-2-review">Apple Watch Ultra</a>, another very expensive smartwatch. The titanium frame around the display gives the Galaxy Watch Ultra an added level of durability.</p><p>It also has one of the best displays on any Samsung watch. The Watch Ultra features a 1.5-inch Super AMOLED panel with a 480 x 480 pixel resolution and a maximum brightness of up to 3,000 nits. It comes in three colors: Titanium Silver, Titanium Gray, and Titanium White. It lacks a rotating bezel, which the Watch 8 Classic will most likely have, but you do get a third customizable Quick Button for jumping in and out of activities.</p><p>Besides the usual durability certifications like MIL-STD-810H, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is also rated for 10ATM water resistance, which is double that of most other watches. It's also tested to survive in chlorinated or salty water, which means you can safely go swimming with it in a pool or the ocean.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-hardware-and-specs-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8bfw7EPSxQXeXiJzaUP4a9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K2-scaled" alt="Two renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like, one facing forward-right and the other back-left.

This puts it between the Galaxy Watch 8 and the Watch Ultra.</p><p>There is no word on the processor yet, but we believe the Watch 8 Classic may continue to use the Exynos W1000 SoC from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-vs-galaxy-watch-7">Galaxy Watch 7</a> series. This was introduced just last year, and Samsung has been known to reuse its smartwatch chips across multiple generations. We might get a tweaked version of the chip for better efficiency, but I don't think we'll see any massive changes. The Watch 8 Classic will likely have at least 2GB of RAM, along with 32GB of storage.</p><p>As for battery capacity, the Watch 8 Classic is expected to have a 450mAh battery, so slightly larger than the standard Watch 8 (and Watch 7) but smaller than the Watch Ultra. We'll still have either 10W or 15W inductive charging, and the Watch 8 Classic would also most likely not work with the reverse wireless charging feature on Samsung phones due to the redesigned BioActive sensor.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic (rumored/expected)</p></th><th  ><p>Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>46 x 46.5 x 14.2 mm (46m or 47mm)</p></td><td  ><p>47.4 x 47.4 x 12.1 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch display, exact specs unknown</p></td><td  ><p>1.5-inch Super AMOLED, 480x480 pixels resolution</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Durability & Case Material</p></td><td  ><p>Stainless Steel & Sapphire Crystal, 5ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td><td  ><p>Titanium & Sapphire Crystal, 10ATM water resistance, IP68 & MIL-STD-810H certification</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>60.5g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset / SoC</p></td><td  ><p>Unknown</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos W1000</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM & Storage</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td><td  ><p>2GB & 32GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Navigation & Physical Controls</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td><td  ><p>Home, Back & Quick buttons, and Touchscreen</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td><td  ><p>Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart Signal + Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis), Temperature Sensor, Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic Sensor, Light Sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi (dual-band), Bluetooth 5.3, LTE (optional), GPS, and NFC</p></td><td  ><p>LTE, Bluetooth 5.3, WiFi 2.4/5GHz, NFC, GPS (L1+L5), Glonass, Beidou, Galileo</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery & Charging</p></td><td  ><p>450mAh</p></td><td  ><p>590mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 8 Watch (Wear OS 6)</p></td><td  ><p>One UI 6 Watch (Wear OS 5)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra launched at $649, although Samsung is now officially selling it for roughly $450. That's a significant discount and brings it closer to what the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might ultimately cost. In fact, the LTE version of the Watch 8 Classic may be the same or slightly more expensive than the Ultra when it launches. This would really make you think doubly hard before picking one.</p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is powered by the Exynos W1000 SoC, and it has 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Health and fitness tracking performance was very good, although GPS positioning wasn't as accurate as a Garmin watch. Overall, we found the fitness hardware to be much stronger compared to previous generations when we reviewed it.</p><p>The Watch Ultra is the best Samsung watch for those who require the ultimate battery life. Samsung promises 60 hours with the always-on display enabled, and this is something we managed to achieve in our testing. Charging is not the fastest, as in our experience, it typically takes about two hours to fully charge the watch from an empty battery.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-software-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-Ultra-ecg.jpeg" alt="An ECG reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7mrkoZzGaUGqnUb5w9JFzQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic will most likely come with the latest One UI 8 Watch, which should be based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>.

Some of these features would include a new metric called "vascular load," which monitors your daily cardiovascular system and provides alerts if you're engaging in excessive activity. The Health app will also feature a "personal health coach" that provides tips on weight loss, helps you achieve your sleep goals, and updates you on your overall health progress.</p><p>Along with these new features, we should also see the same or tweaked BioActive sensor for heart rate, ECG, SpO2, and skin temperature tracking, carried forward from the Galaxy Watch Ultra. The redesigned BioActive sensor from last year's models allowed the Watch Ultra to monitor a new metric called AGEs Index, but this was just one of "many new advanced features" that were planned.</p><p>This means we could see some new health metrics being added to the Watch 8 Classic, which should eventually come to the Watch Ultra in the next big software update.</p><h2 id="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-vs-galaxy-watch-ultra-which-one-is-better-2">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic vs. Galaxy Watch Ultra: Which one is better?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2880px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9" name="Galaxy-Watch-8-Classic-5K1-scaled" alt="Three renders of what the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic might look like in a row, with the Classic facing left, forward, and right, each model showing a circular AMOLED display, rotating metal bezel, orange Action button, and squircle case." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d2n4bZeTi8fYsotxTahEf9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2880" height="1620" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / SammyGurus)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 Classic has yet to be officially launched, but based on what we know so far, it appears to be a solid middle ground between the Watch 8 and the Watch Ultra. The rotating bezel would be a significant incentive for purchasing this model, as it makes navigating menus and features more seamless, especially when the touchscreen is unavailable. The mix of a squircle watch frame with the circular display actually looks kind of cool, if the Classic ends up looking like the leaked renders.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra will still have its niche fans, and those who need the extra ruggedness won't mind spending a premium for it. For most people, though, the Watch 8 Classic would be a better choice and would be one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a> to buy.

I'm using the 16GB/512GB configuration, and I think this hits the sweet spot both with pricing and storage.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Redmagic 10S Pro</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.85-inch 144Hz AMOLED, 2688x1216, 2,000 nits max, Gorilla Glass 7i</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Redmagic OS 10.5 based on Android 15</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Chipset</p></td><td  ><p>Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite Leading Version, Adreno 830, 3nm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB/16GB/24GB LPDDR5X</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB/1TB UFS 4.1</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.9, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/2.0 wide-angle lens</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front camera</p></td><td  ><p>16MP f/2.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP54 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, 5G bands, NFC, dual-band GPS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Security</p></td><td  ><p>Optical in-screen sensor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Audio</p></td><td  ><p>USB-C, stereo sound, 24-bit/192kHz, Snapdragon Sound, AptX HD, AptX Adaptive, AptX Lossless</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,050mAh silicon battery, 80W charging</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>163.4 x 76.1 x 8.9mm, 229g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Silver, Black</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-design"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Design</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="2A3HpHEwBsjssLuLzMdpLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2A3HpHEwBsjssLuLzMdpLQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">You may like: </div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text">- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-rog-phone-9-pro-review">ASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro review</a><br>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra review<br></a>- <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iqoo-13-review">iQOO 13 review</a></p></div></div><p>I like gaming phones because they're flamboyant, and the 10S Pro is no different. Redmagic had its share of ostentatious designs in the past, but I like how clean the 10S Pro looks; the see-through aesthetic isn't as bold as Nothing's devices, but it still allows the 10S Pro to stand out visually.</p><p>Like the best gaming phones, the 10S Pro gets RGB lighting at the back. There are two lighting zones — a stylized X next to the camera island and Redmagic logo at the bottom — and you can easily customize the colors. The white model I'm using looks fabulous, and a key design differentiator is the fully flat back — there's no visible camera protrusion.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5154px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="dxr7ddyFQAumHQvLtykuLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dxr7ddyFQAumHQvLtykuLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5154" height="2903" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4921px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b5eYfAPsruAhpuJc4MTFLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b5eYfAPsruAhpuJc4MTFLQ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4921" height="2772" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google got plenty of praise with the Pixel 9a because of a similar design decision, and Redmagic did just as well with the 10S Pro; if anything, the Chinese brand deserves more credit as it's using a larger sensor at the back. I've gotten so used to phones with oversized camera modules that it's a refreshing change of pace to go back that doesn't protrude, and I like what Redmagic did with the overall design.</p><p>A side-effect of the design is that the 10S Pro slides off any surface that isn't flat; it took nearly a dozen tumbles from the couch in the 10 days I used it, which in itself is a new record. Annoyingly, one of those tumbles led to a microfracture at the edge of the panel, and the 10S Pro joins the unwelcome list of phones that broke during routine use — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/asus-zenfone-12-ultra-review">ASUS Zenfone 12 Ultra</a> is the only other device that did so in the last seven years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="G648FfhWfsFdQUECmrLR7Q" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/G648FfhWfsFdQUECmrLR7Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All of this is to say that if you're eyeing this phone, I'd suggest using it with a case. While I like the design, it clearly isn't as durable as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo-x200-pro-review">Vivo X200 Pro</a> or any of the other Chinese flagships I used this year, and it is quite blocky and unforgiving; you don't get much bevels on the sides, so it digs into your palm. The phone gets Gorilla Glass 7i covering the panel and Gorilla Glass 5 at the back.</p><p>Also, Redmagic went overboard with the buttons; there are just too many on the right, and the brand should have moved the volume rocker to the left. As it stands, it's hard to access the power button as it sits too low on the side. Then there's the gaming toggle; it's located just where you'd position the phone on a car mount, and it constantly triggered gaming mode while I was navigating.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zk2bbZNTqehAfXAmnasyLQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 10S Pro has a built-in fan at the back, and there are vents that serve as the intake and exhaust. This isn't just a gimmick either; I tested the exhaust via a Fluke thermal camera, and it makes a difference in extended gaming sessions. Because of the vents, the 10S Pro is limited to IP54 ingress protection, and you miss out on IP68. The plus side is that the 3.5mm jack is intact.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-screen"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Screen</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fibo7LsrkVsutcS4gSaZdQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fibo7LsrkVsutcS4gSaZdQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A clear advantage to using the 10S Pro is that you don't get a cutout at the front; the phone has a selfie camera hidden beneath the panel, and unless you're using it outdoors, you can't even make it out. This is a big deal while gaming and watching multimedia, and I like what Redmagic did in this area.</p><p>It nailed the rest of the details as well: the device gets a good AMOLED panel with 144Hz refresh, and it has all the gaming extras you need. Demanding games go up to 120fps, and the phone is an absolute joy to use. A lot of that has to do with the fluidity; it is one of the fastest phones I've used yet.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ye4MEMaVYZaAYMj4sfwbSQ" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ye4MEMaVYZaAYMj4sfwbSQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to the 3.5mm jack, you can easily plug in IEMs if that's your preferred choice of audio gear.

So if you like playing shooters, the triggers are a good way to gain an advantage. I didn't see any issues in extended gaming sessions either; the phone tends to run hot, but that is the case with all 2025 devices featuring Qualcomm silicon, and after 30 minutes of gaming, it didn't exceed 48 degrees.</p><p>Weirdly enough, I had problems with connectivity. Internet was rock-solid on my home network, but every time I switched over to cellular data, it just wouldn't load sites even though it showed a strong signal. I'm using the U.S. variant of the device, and even though it has the requisite 5G bands, it still didn't connect reliably. I'm attributing this to my unit and not the device in general, but it's an annoying bug nonetheless.</p><p>The phone has a huge 7,050mAh silicon-carbon battery, and even with heavy use, it lasted a day and a half. Most of the time, you'll only need to charge the 10S Pro every two days on average, and when you need to plug it in, there's 80W charging.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-redmagic-10s-pro-cameras"><span>Redmagic 10S Pro: Cameras</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="bP43aiuaVQnPgoZsnkoKqP" name="Redmagic 10S Pro" alt="Redmagic 10S Pro review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bP43aiuaVQnPgoZsnkoKqP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The 10S Pro comes with a 50MP main camera and a 50MP wide-angle lens, and it's clear that the cameras are an afterthought on this device.

It is fluid, doesn't have any issues in regular use, and while you don't get as much customizability as other brands, the basics are covered.</p><p>It's ironic that you'll need to buy a gaming phone to get a clean software with good optimization.

ASUS went with a mainstream design this year, so the phone doesn't stand out quite as much as the 10S Pro. That said, it is just as fast, and the AMOLED panel is fabulous. The only annoyance is ASUS' inability to deliver more than two software updates; that intentionally hobbles what is one of the best hardware packages.</p><p>If you don't want an overt gaming phone, the iQOO 13 is my recommendation.

It is much better than its predecessors, and the design is a standout — both at the front and back. The flat back is great to use, and active cooling ensures it doesn't overheat. While this is a giant slab of a phone, it doesn't have the same durability as other devices, and you'll need to use a case at the least.</p><p>The cameras aren't that great either; while you get decent shots, they don't measure up to true flagships.

This exclusive AI assistant feature is allegedly still inbound for the Pixel 10 series. The tipster offered a look at what Google could provide Pixel 10 users when setting up Magic Cue.

That piece of software was called "Pixie" at the start and was stated to be "smarter" and "more personal" than the old Assistant (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">which Gemini is kicking out</a>). Google's plans have remained consistent, with those 2023 rumors stating Pixie would leverage your data from Maps, Gmail, and whatever else you've given it access to.</p><p>However, this exclusive Pixel assistant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-to-debut-with-ai-powered-pixie">underwent a name change</a> back in March. A few months ago, we were reportedly calling the AI "Pixel Sense." During that report, more information about the AI came to light, like its ability to process "media files, including text, images, AI-generated content, and associated metadata." For example, if Pixel Sense is active and you take a screenshot, the AI will catalog it internally to help you later on if you're looking for it again.</p><p>There's been some privacy and security concerns, especially considering how involved Pixie or Pixel Sense, or Magic Cue will be with what you're doing. Like the screenshots above, sources claim the data the AI obtains will remain private and "visible only to you, not even Google can see it."</p><p>We're still yet to see exactly how Magic Cue works on a Pixel, but we won't have to wait much longer if it's headed for the Pixel 10.

Moreover, we're seeing the Adreno 840 GPU rumor once again, two months later.</p><p>While DCS claims the chip's "second-generation" Oryon CPU cores are putting in overtime in its latest test, there were rumors that Qualcomm could bring "enhanced Pegasus" cores to the 8 Elite 2.</p><p>Pricing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-successor-price-rumors">could be a concern</a>, like it was with the first model, but there's also Qualcomm's potential core architecture.

While Samsung, Google, and other major players in the Android smartphone space <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/samsung-dropped-the-ball-qi2-galaxy-s24" target="_blank">haven't yet fulfilled our dreams</a>, accessory makers have stepped in to bridge the gap. So, while we wait for Qi2 to enter the mainstream, you can enjoy all of the best magnetic accessories with a MagSafe adapter.</p><p>With a good magnetic ring from trusted brands like ESR or Spigen, you can make almost any MagSafe accessory work with your Android phone. Whether you're using a premium device like the S25 Ultra or a more affordable Pixel 9a, if you want it to stick, just pop a ring on the back.</p><p>There are so many amazing MagSafe add-ons available. Items such as wallets, grips, stands, and mounts can be used without a second thought. Be cautious when using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-charging-pads" target="_blank">wireless chargers</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-qi-wireless-charging-power-banks" target="_blank">wireless portable chargers</a>, as most of them are designed for iPhones and do not support Android's wireless charging protocols.</p><p>We love the PopSockets Phone Grip with MagSafe Adapter Ring because it comes with an Adapter Ring in the box. There are loads of amazing colors and designs available; we love to see them! And, of course, the tops are swappable with any other PopSockets PopGrip top.</p><p>For Qi2 wireless charging, we recommend the ESR HaloLock Qi2 Mini Wireless Charger. If you want something to power up your phone on the go, the Mophie Snap+ Juice Pack Mini is an excellent choice for Android users. Mophie includes magnetic rings called Snap adapters with both products, which saves you the time, effort, and money to buy one separately.</p><p>MagSafe kickstands and wallets are everywhere these days. ESR's HaloLock 5,000mAh Power Bank Wallet stands out by doubling as a kickstand and portable charger. And if you're feeling bold, you can even attach Apple's MagSafe leather wallet to your S25 Ultra or Pixel 9!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The main highlight here is what's being suggested for the base Galaxy Watch 8 model: a squircle design.

The publication claims there are "notches," indicating the Watch 8 Classic will return its rotating bezel feature.</p><h2 id="the-journey-so-far-2">The Journey so far</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-base-model-render-leak" alt="A leaked rendering of the base Galaxy Watch 8 suggests it will receive a simpler, cleaner squircle design with two physical buttons." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y2JgXdyhUcT9xxTp3ydHaW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:598px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.33%;"><img id="Xx63grLnPhbuW6okHLPqaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-classic-rendering-black-leather" alt="A leaked rendering of the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic in black with a prominent crown, which is expected to rotate." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Xx63grLnPhbuW6okHLPqaW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="598" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:601px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.83%;"><img id="gDiQSwetkTYykbPPB7ujaW" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-8-ultra-black-render-leak" alt="A leaked render of the next Galaxy Watch Ultra in blue with a rugged strap and a large squircle design." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gDiQSwetkTYykbPPB7ujaW.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="601" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>These renders double down on what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/galaxy-watch-8-series-imagery-squircle-quick-button-leaks">was rumored earlier this year</a>: that Samsung would spread its Watch Ultra design across the entire series.

According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-10-qi-2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories-3566103/">Android Authority</a>, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10 </a>series may come with Qi 2.2 compatibility. The publication notes that they were able to access "credible marketing materials intended for retailers," which points to Google working on a range of these Qi2 accessories.</p><p>The tech giant appears to be referring to this group of accessories as "Pixelsnap" and could end up resembling Apple's MagSafe charging systems. The publication further states that there are supposedly three accessories in the works: a Pixelsnap charger, a Pixelsnap charger with a stand, and a Pixelsnap Ring Stand.</p><p>What these accessories would look like remains a mystery; however, there are speculations that the “Pixelsnap Charger” is likely a basic wireless charger, much like the Apple's MagSafe, the “Pixelsnap Charger with Stand” could be an accessory that keeps the phone upright, allowing you to use your phone while its charging, assuming it could look a little like the Pixel stand with Qi2 compatibility.</p><p>As for the "Pixelsnap Ring stand," it could be a ring-like charging accessory that could function as a stand as well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZHSd6tWu83Dm7Xr44ZPah6" name="Pixelsnap-Qi2-charging" alt="Evidence for the new Pixelsnap charger in a trade database" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZHSd6tWu83Dm7Xr44ZPah6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website further notes that they were able to spot direct references to the Pixelsnap accessories on a trade database. The entries in the database suggest that Google's Qi 2.2 chargers may be in the works.</p><p>Certain terms within the database, like "STN4," could be the codename for the charger, while "MPP" stands for Magnetic Power Profile on a wireless charger, and as for the charging speed, the publication indicates that ike  “ConvenientPower CPS4041,” indicate the support for up to 60W charging, which allegedly is a presence of a chip that allows for up to 60W charging.</p><p>The website also appears to have spotted hints at potential Pixel 10 colorways, such as “Rock Candy” and “Mist,” as well as black and Porcelain colorways, as seen in the screenshot above.</p><h2 id="more-evidence-of-qi2-on-pixel-10-2">More evidence of Qi2 on Pixel 10</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-on-pixel-stand-v2.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro Fold on Pixel Stand V2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pUzmDQ5w4SXsb8AywoheAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a subsequent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/google-pixel-10-charger">post</a>, Android Headlines seems to have gotten more information on these alleged accessories. The website claims that the Qi2 charger will "look a whole lot like Apple’s own MagSafe charger. While the stand will look like the current Pixel Stand 2, with a slot to slide in the Qi2 charger."</p><p>That said, Android Headlines notes that you can only charge the Pixel 10 series wirelessly if you have a case that supports Qi2 and that Google will be making its cases Qi2 compatible. This means the Pixel 10 series might not show up with the magnets on its rear panel, and cannot be charged wirelessly on its own.</p><p>Additionally, it states that Google could also sell several Qi2 accessories from the “Made for Google” program to casemakers like Belkin, Bellroy, Spigen, and others, allowing users to choose from a wide range of products. Lastly, the website adds that Google could also be working on a dual-port USB-C charger that supports 45W charging speeds.</p><p>It remains unclear whether users can charge only their phones or other Google products, such as Pixel Buds and the Pixel Watch, with the Pixelsnap accessories. While these are still rumors, we expect to get more information on the Pixel 10 series' charging capabilities closer to launch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting at $819.99, the Boox Tab X C is available for purchase starting today. It’s a thin and light tablet measuring just 5.3mm thick, all while offering Android 13 support and an E-ink color display.</p><p>The tablet is a new refresh of the Boox Tab X, a black-and-white E-ink tablet with Android 11 and a thicker build. By comparison, the Boox Tab X C is thinner, runs a new version of Android, and adds the color E-ink screen. The Onyx Boox Tab X C could be for the person who wants an E-ink tablet or reading device without compromise. With support for Android and Google Play Store apps, as well as a color screen, the Onyx Boox can do almost everything a traditional Android tablet could.</p><p>For specs, the tablet has a 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display that’s about the size of A4 paper. This means you could use it for reading, looking at documents and PDFs, or taking notes without dealing with wonky aspect ratios. It features 150 pixels-per-inch (ppi) when using color, which is upped to 300ppi when in black-and-white mode.</p><p>The company says the Boox Tab X C is built with “an advanced octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM, and exclusive BSR technology” that adds up to deliver “exceptional multitasking capabilities.” It comes with an upgraded InkSpire stylus for note-taking and annotating, and you get a free magnetic case when buying from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://shop.boox.com/products/tabxc" target="_blank">Boox store</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JXgfAM9zfbWXog3tRwevnc" name="onyx-boox-tab-x-lifestyle-5.jpg" alt="Onyx Boox Tab X E Ink tablet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JXgfAM9zfbWXog3tRwevnc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Onyx Boox Tab X E-ink tablet.  </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Namerah Saud Fatmi / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Priced at over $800, the Boox Tab X C is in the same category as top iPad, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab">Samsung Galaxy Tab</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/oneplus-pad-3-review">OnePlus Pad</a> models. That could make it a tough sell, as you’re getting an Android version that’s three years out-of-date and less processing power. Still, it’s important to remember what the Boox Tab X C is and who it’s designed for.</p><p>This is for fans of E-ink readers and tablets who want the performance and openness of Android, all in a compact package. They can be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/e-ink-phones-are-amazing-but-you-might-want-to-keep-a-camera-nearby">easier on the eyes</a> and feel more natural compared to LCD or OLED tablets.</p> ]]></dc:content>
