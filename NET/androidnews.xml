                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Google is constantly churning out experimental AI features in Google Labs, including CC, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-cc-ai-agent-is-a-morning-brief-for-early-birds-that-taps-into-workspace">AI productivity agent announced last month</a>. It's perhaps the most intriguing entry for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/everything-you-need-know-about-google-workspace-spaces-and-smart-canvas">Google Workspace users</a> into the world of what is known as agentic artificial intelligence. This emerging technology uses AI agents that can take actions independently on your behalf to save you time and effort.</p><p>Google's CC optionally integrates with Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, and the web to give you curated daily briefings. This early Google Labs experiment opened up to personal Google accounts in the U.S. and Canada in December, and users can sign up for the waitlist <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://labs.google/cc" target="_blank">here</a>. Availability is opening for Google AI subscribers first, starting with users on the Ultra plan.</p><p>While some gained access to CC within hours of joining the waitlist, I only received access over the weekend on a personal Google AI Pro account. It's unclear how many people Google is letting try CC at a time, but if you're an AI Pro subscriber like me who joined the waitlist, check for an introductory email from CC. Now that I've been using CC for a few days, it's clear that it might be the one AI tool to keep me on track.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U3kRduz9Yubbo3F37FiC4Q" name="Google-CC-3" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U3kRduz9Yubbo3F37FiC4Q.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The signup process for the experiment takes two steps: enabling <strong>Smart Settings</strong> in your Google Workspace settings and joining the waitlist on the Google Labs site. Once you gain access, you'll be able to chat with CC over email and receive daily reports. Here's how the experimental productivity agent could help streamline your workflows.</p><h2 id="what-it-s-like-to-have-cc-manage-your-inbox-2">What it's like to have CC manage your inbox</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AJn3WzXsV9sDouhMmw9hDQ" name="Google-CC-5" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AJn3WzXsV9sDouhMmw9hDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your introduction to CC will likely start with the productivity agent proving how well it knows your inbox. In my case, CC started with the following standard welcome message:</p><div><blockquote><p>ⓒⓒ Hi Brady,👋 I'm CC, your new AI productivity agent from Google Labs. My job is to help you stay organized, get things done and ultimately give back time for what matters most.</p><p>CC</p></blockquote></div><p>Then, it veered into the realm of personal by saying "I'm already thinking about how you're managing your journalism career..." CC's immediate knowledge of me and the work I do with my Google account was certainly jarring yet impressive. But when you hand over your Gmail, Calendar, and Drive data to an AI agent, that's probably to be expected.</p><p>CC is both an autonomous helper and an on-demand chatbot. Users get a daily briefing that identifies action items, upcoming events, important emails and deals, and more. It's called "Your Day Ahead," and it can be customized to your liking by simply replying to the email with instructions. Alternatively, you can contact CC anytime by emailing the address for the agent, which is available in the following format: [your Google username]+cc@gmail.com.</p><p>It sounds like a better alternative to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-workspace-gets-a-much-needed-boost-with-geminis-new-smarts">Gemini in Workspace</a> for those that use their email as a do-it-all productivity tool. If you're the kind of person that sends emails to themselves instead of using a note-taking app, or one that uses Gmail as a cloud storage solution, CC will come in handy. It can remember information, summarize it, and search it.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mxixh5rNqn8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>CC has already made it impossible for me to forget the important details by resurfacing them on a daily basis. That includes events and deadlines you might have long forgotten. In its opening act, CC reminded me of a meeting I had set weeks ago, and it became an immediate lifesaver.</p><p>The agent includes hotlinks to source material and suggested actions in an effort to predict your next move. Depending on what it summarizes, CC might suggest you reply to a colleague, view a link, or add an event to your Google Calendar. Notably, these links don't seem to work reliably on mobile, and Google notes this is a known issue in the footers of emails from CC.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tXKLHS6QEcnaT6pnyBggHQ" name="Google-CC-4" alt="The Google CC agent in Gmail." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tXKLHS6QEcnaT6pnyBggHQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can rate an email from CC with a simple thumbs up or down, or reply to it to ask a question, clarify something, or give detailed feedback for next time.</p><p>I currently have hundreds of thousands of unread emails across my various email accounts. No, I'm not proud of it. If we're being honest, I probably won't do anything about it anytime soon. That makes CC the perfect virtual personal assistant for me. It surfaces the important details and makes it easy to ignore the promotions and spam, allowing me to take command of my inbox for the first time.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company states that while users have their views on ChatGPT and the assistance it can bring, it also wants to ensure its ads adhere to those expectations. OpenAI adds that its goal is to bring "truly relevant, high-quality ads," as well as control over them.</p><p>User choice/control was a key highlight for OpenAI moving forward with these upcoming ads. According to the post, users will have the option to disable personalization in ChatGPT, alongside the option to clear all "data used for ads at any time." OpenAI claims it will "always" give users a way to not see ads, which will be joined by a paid ad-free tier.</p><p>How intrusive ads will be was another talking point.</p><p>OpenAI states that ChatGPT's ads won't "influence" the AI's responses to queries. In fact, it states that the ads it will show will be "optimized" to be relevant to what you're doing. An example shows a user asking ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas for a dinner party. While the AI responded as normal, offering dish suggestions, the "relevant" ad was for hot sauce from a grocery store.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:728px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:82.42%;"><img id="MgYPq3x4ifQiEHNPUTQJcJ" name="openai-chatgpt-ads-example" alt="OpenAI prepares ads in its ChatGPT chats, which will be present at the bottom and are designed to be "relevant" to what your query is." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MgYPq3x4ifQiEHNPUTQJcJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="728" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Ads are planned to be clearly separated from the user's chat with the AI. Users will find who the ad is from, the product in question, the price, the stock availability, and feedback buttons.</p><p>OpenAI says it's not going to just drop ads into its app. Ads are headed for "logged-in adults" in the U.S. on its free and (new) Go tier. The post states that ads will first show up at the bottom of chats; however, there could be a future where users could query ChatGPT about the ad to make an educated decision before making a purchase.</p><h2 id="chatgpt-go-2">ChatGPT... Go!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:766px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.33%;"><img id="cMqxbzavhvVEckT5K3cpHD" name="openai-chatgpt-go-tier-pricing" alt="ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's newest subscription tier for its AI, available for users at $8 a month." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cMqxbzavhvVEckT5K3cpHD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="766" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>OpenAI's announcements to end the week <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-go/">conclude with its newest</a> (and cheapest) AI subscription plan: ChatGPT Go. After debuting in India, OpenAI is now ready to bring its cheapest AI plan to the U.S. after reportedly observing a "high adoption rate." The post states that ChatGPT Go offers the company's GPT‑5.2 Instant model at a lower cost, which may entice more people to give it a try.</p><p>ChatGPT Go <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/plans/go/">is available</a> for $8 a month.</p><p>At this lower price, ChatGPT Go gives users "10x more messages," file uploads, and image creation when compared to the free tier's capabilities. Additionally, the AI features a larger memory and context window with this Go tier, meaning it'll remember much more about you if you'd like.</p><p>OpenAI reports that many users who've engaged with ChatGPT Go typically leverage its intelligence for writing, learning, image creation, and problem-solving. As previously stated, ChatGPT Go is here for U.S. users; however, it's also made itself accessible globally today, too.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And according to ardent tipster Mystic Leaks, Google could be planning a split layout for notifications and toggles, potentially enhancing usability for Pixel users. This would make the menu look a lot cleaner, more organized, and split instead of one large pull-down for everything.</p><p>This means that swiping from the left edge would show only notifications, while swiping from the right would bring up Quick Settings, neat right? That said, for Pixel users, this change seems to be optional. You’ll probably be able to go to Settings > Notifications and switch between the classic "Combined" view and the new "Separate" layout.</p><h2 id="google-s-budget-pixel-10a-could-launch-very-soon-2">Google's budget Pixel 10a could launch very soon</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3410px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn" name="Google-Pixel-10-At-a-Glance" alt="The At a Glance widget on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JvHZSo8pjw9StxB5jkVXmn.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3410" height="1917" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/word-on-the-street-is-the-pixel-10a-is-headed-for-shelves-in-february"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google's mid-range Pixel, or the a-series device, usually arrives around April.

It was created in tandem with its new partnership with Click Therapeutics. According to the post, the latter is an "FDA-authorized prescription digital therapeutic designed to offer both migraine-related insights and guided activities."</p><p>For Migraine PowerPlug, the feature is designed to give users support for harsh migraines while outside of the doctor's office, "in real-time."</p><p>Click's states that it's combining Ultrahuman's biomarker analytics capabilities with its digital therapeutic IP, CT-132. CT-132 has received FDA authorization to help users who suffer from migraines manage them and reduce the toll they take. Per the company's research, there are a few key areas in our daily lives that can contribute to terrible migraines. Areas such as your sleep quality, HRV (heart rate variability), stress load, and more can directly affect migraine patterns and strength.</p><p>Migraine PowerPlug is said to track these contributors to then "translate those trends into practical, personalized lifestyle guidance." Moreover, Click states that Migraine PowerPlug will identify patterns, so the user can improve.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> customers received bad news this week: the cost of Spotify subscriptions in the U.S. is going up for the third time in under three years. The change immediately makes Spotify Premium one of the most expensive music streaming services on the market, with the new individual plan costing $2 more per month than comparable options on Apple Music, Tidal, and YouTube Music.</p><p>Specifically, Spotify Premium Individual will cost $12.99 per month (up from $11.99), and Spotify Premium Student will cost $6.99 per month (up from $5.99). The company is raising the cost of Duo and Family plans by an even greater margin. The two-user Spotify Premium Duo tier will cost $18.99 per month (up from $16.99), while the Spotify Premium Family plan will cost $21.99 per month (up from $19.99).</p><p>As announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2026-01-15/premium-pricing-update/" target="_blank">blog post</a>, these new rates take effect immediately for new subscribers. Existing Spotify customers will be charged the increased prices starting at their next billing date. Spotify's short explanation of the price hike said the changes "reflect the value that Spotify delivers."</p><div><blockquote><p>Occasional updates to pricing across our markets reflect the value that Spotify delivers, enabling us to continue offering the best possible experience and benefit artists.</p><p>Spotify</p></blockquote></div><p>At the old price of $11.99 per month, Spotify's Premium Individual plan was already priced higher than the individual subscriptions for Apple Music, Tidal, and YouTube Music.</p><p>The old price was the same as Amazon Music Unlimited for non-Prime members, but Amazon Prime subscribers are eligible for a cheaper $10.99 per month rate. Now, Spotify is more expensive than every competitor listed above, and the gap is particularly wide for multi-user plans.</p><div style="min-height: 250px;">                                <div class="kwizly-quiz kwizly-XrPzBW"></div>                            </div>                            <script src="https://kwizly.com/embed/XrPzBW.js" async></script><p>While Spotify notes that pricing updates help it "benefit artists," the situation is more complicated than that. Spotify pays out a larger percentage of its revenue to music rightsholders (which pass on earnings to artists) than some competitors, like Apple Music. However, due to Spotify's pricing model, including a free tier, it ends up paying rightsholders less on a per-stream basis than Tidal and Apple Music.</p><p>If you uploaded a song to every major streaming service and it earned a thousand streams, Tidal would pay out the most, with Apple Music, Amazon Music Unlimited, Spotify, and YouTube Music following in that order.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2886px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="6GmWWspavCffiJoLoBW3an" name="spotify-lossless-google-pixel-9" alt="Spotify lossless audio menu option" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6GmWWspavCffiJoLoBW3an.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2886" height="1623" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The timing of the price hike isn't a good look for Spotify. It comes just a few months after the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/spotify-lossless-audio-requires-this-gear-to-work">finally delivered lossless, CD-quality streaming for Spotify Premium subscribers</a> in September 2025. The move ended an embarrassing saga for Spotify, as it announced the feature in February 2021 but took nearly half a decade to release it.</p><p>The feature was included free with Spotify Premium when it debuted, but just a few months later, the price of that subscription service is going up. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotify-might-raise-prices-again-for-us-users-in-early-2026">Rumors of a Spotify price hike</a> started appearing just one month after Spotify Lossless became available.</p><p>Other streaming services, like Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music Unlimited, offer lossless streaming in higher quality than Spotify at lower monthly prices.</p><p>That's not to say Spotify isn't investing in upgrading its music streaming platform. It continuously adds features, but they may not be the ones music lovers want. Spotify added direct messaging to the app before adding support for lossless audio. It has also leaned into podcasts and audiobooks while cramming artificial intelligence tools into the app.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that Spotify fans rightly prefer the app's algorithm, recommendations, and social features over the competition, which are generally considered superior.</p><h2 id="is-it-time-to-leave-spotify-for-another-subscription-service-2">Is it time to leave Spotify for another subscription service?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6" name="youtube-music-hero.jpg" alt="youtube music hero" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KmKrgnNUK4XiYTj2BbWkP6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Spotify's latest price hike brings more attention to the fact that the music streaming service is actually not a great value compared to competitors. That is, despite the platform having the largest active user base of any music streaming service on the planet. For Android users in particular, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-music">YouTube Music and YouTube Premium look incredibly appealing</a> following Spotify's price change.</p><p>The standard YouTube Music Premium Individual plan costs $10.99 per month or $109.99 annually, although it's worth noting that YouTube Music lacks lossless audio support. The real value option is subscribing to YouTube Premium for $13.99 per month — just a dollar more monthly than the new Spotify Premium Individual plan, which grants you all the benefits of YouTube Premium <em>and</em> YouTube Music, as well as all the hidden gem remixes that you likely can't find on Spotify.</p><p>For lossless audio fanatics, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">I like both Apple Music and Tidal for just $10.99 per month</a> over Spotify. These streaming services deliver higher-quality lossless audio than Spotify. They also each offer Dolby Atmos tracks, which Spotify does not. Amazon Music Unlimited <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music-unlimited-getting-one-apple-musics-best-features">also offers high-res lossless and Dolby Atmos support</a>, but its base price before the Prime discount is higher than Apple Music and Tidal.</p><p>Is the Spotify price hike enough to finally push you to switch to a different streaming service? I use Apple Music, even on Android and Windows, and I love the no-nonsense experience. It's just a music app, prioritizing hi-res and immersive audio formats and omitting unnecessary features like podcasts, audiobooks, and AI. Now, it does all that while costing two dollars less per month than Spotify.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Allegedly, leaked details state OpenAI's earbuds, currently named "Sweet Pea," will contain strong hardware, specifically chips that are positioned to handle "high-performance" and AI computing.</p><p>Moreover, OpenAI might seek an open-ear-style design for these buds. Leaks indicate that the device in question features an egg-shaped body made of metal. There are also two "capsules" (or capsule-like objects) that will wrap around the ear and sit behind it against the user's head.</p><p>OpenAI has reportedly tapped Foxconn for the production of these earbuds, per this leak; however, that's not all. The post cites additional rumors that claim the company is also looking to produce four more AI-based devices for consumers. At the moment, rumors aren't clear about what these other products could be. What has been alleged is that OpenAI could look to achieve mass-production by the end of 2028.</p><p>OpenAI might position its codename "Sweet Pea" earbuds as a "portable AI gateway."

That's it, the whole enchilada. Energy still transfers the same way, and it functions just like the batteries you're used to, only it's a whole lot better. Why?</p><p>Changing the material the electrolyte is made of and changing its role make a handful of big differences. Mostly good ones. A "regular" battery is built like this:</p><p>You have two electrodes — a cathode (the positive pole) made of what's called a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://cathwell.com/cathodic-protection-explained/" target="_blank">cathodic material</a> like lithium-iron phosphate, and an anode (the negative pole) made of an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/anode-material" target="_blank">anodic material</a> like graphite or carbon.</p><p>Between the two sits a central separator and insulator made of polyethylene that prevents them from ever coming into direct contact.</p><p>The entire cell is filled with an electrolyte containing lithium salt. Both electrodes are submerged in this, and it allows lithium ions to move through between the positive and negative poles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1548px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW" name="battery-packs-169.jpg" alt="Battery packs" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aR5umpaonXg2VoBZQj4EoW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1548" height="871" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The internals of a solid-state cell are completely different. No flammable liquids are involved because everything inside is solid. What changes are in bold below:</p><p>You still have a cathode, and it is still made from a "standard" cathodic material like LFP, the same as a traditional cell.</p><p>The separator is made of ceramic or a solid polymer that conducts. <strong>It also acts as the electrolyte.</strong></p><p><strong>The anode is made of pure lithium.</strong></p><p>Imagine filling a cardboard box with concrete, and before it dries, you stick two metal rods in it. It's sort of like that.</p><p>These changes make a big difference. A solid-state battery is <strong>safer</strong> than a traditional Li-ion cell because there is no flammable liquid that can leak or explode under pressure. This is reason enough alone to use them, but they're also battery batteries all-around.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4121px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="sNpP6RJv7DXHdcu6ZoiUqX" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-08" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K charging a Pixel 10 with a USB-C cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sNpP6RJv7DXHdcu6ZoiUqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4121" height="2318" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>They have a higher density</strong>. This means they can store more energy using the same footprint as a traditional cell. I have a 10,000 mAh portable battery pack that is actually <em>smaller</em> than a "regular" 5,000 mAh battery pack here on my desk. That means more life between charges without any increase in the size of your phone.</p><p><strong>They have a longer lifespan</strong>. As lithium ions are transferred and attracted inside the electrolyte, some are deposited as solid lithium on the negative electrode. Once this happens, these particles <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-take-care-your-phones-battery">no longer work to charge the cell</a>. This doesn't happen the same way in a solid-state battery, and it's theoretically possible to get up to 45,000 charging cycles from one. That's under the most perfect conditions, but in normal use, we can expect about double the lifespan compared to a "regular" battery.</p><p><strong>They safely charge faster</strong>. The negative electrode is what determines the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/faster-charging-isnt-the-answer-we-need-better-batteries">maximum safe charging time</a> of a lithium cell. With a solid electrolyte, higher charging and discharging rates are possible without overheating or volatility, since there is no liquid electrolyte.</p><p><strong>They work in the cold</strong>. Solid-state batteries remain efficient at low temperatures compared to standard lithium-ion cells. There is still a point where they cease to be efficient enough to operate, but you can use and charge a solid-state battery at colder temperatures.</p><h2 id="sounds-good-will-it-be-in-my-next-phone-2">Sounds good. Will it be in my next phone?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge compared to an iPhone 16 Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ErMAYgHCMkvNch3RFBGxvZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Probably, but not just yet. Bummer, I know.</p><p>There are a few disadvantages to solid-state batteries: they're harder to manufacture because the anode "breathes" and slightly expands and contracts, making it harder to compress the entire package. They also still lose efficiency when the separator/electrolyte gets too cold, even if it's not as bad as a traditional cell. Mostly, though, it's the cost factor.</p><p>It costs more to design and build a solid-state battery, so companies making them have to charge more; changing what an electrode is made of is pretty easy, but retooling equipment to build batteries using a solid electrolyte isn't.</p><p>We've reached a point where the extra cost is justified enough, but just barely. If you want your next phone to automatically cost more, the company making it can cram a solid-state battery inside, but most people don't like that idea. Phone makers have to juggle the cost of building a device and the selling price to stay profitable.</p><p>You can already find solid-state battery packs from companies like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.heybmx.com/collections/solid-state-power-banks">Better Mobile Xperience</a>. I've been using both their 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh batteries for a while, and they live up to the hype, but they're not cheap.</p><p>Of course, you can expect to see them in electric vehicles and industrial applications too, but we need to give it a little more time. Once the production issues are figured out, the price will drop, and manufacturers will be inclined to use them - especially in foldables.</p><p>Just know it's coming, and it's better!</p> ]]></dc:content>

Early rumors suggested Samsung might rename the base model to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/-may-not-be-an-s26-pro-either">Galaxy S26 Pro</a>, while other leaks claimed the Plus model would be replaced by a Galaxy S26 Edge.

As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/are-galaxy-s26-pro-edge-still-coming/">SamMobile</a>, Samsung Colombia accidentally published a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/co/tyc/20260110_20260331_tyc_0_Interes_Banco_Davivienda_Q1_2026_01_09.pdf">PDF document</a> outlining various product promotions.</p><p>Interestingly, the document also listed the Galaxy S26 series models, alongside the already-available Galaxy Z Fold 7 and Galaxy Z Flip 7.

The publication found some strings in the source code that reference a feature called "Notify when left behind," which would send a notification to your Pixel Watch whenever you walk away without your phone.</p><p>For the feature to work, as per the report, a few prerequisites are required. Both the phone and watch need to have Bluetooth turned on, and the watch must be worn on your wrist, which is fairly obvious for something like this to function properly.</p><h2 id="google-is-finally-adding-a-phone-left-behind-alert-2">Google is finally adding a phone left-behind alert</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="DJa2JBrhdkhXQtuEgLiKBd" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-and-Pixel-10-2" alt="Pixel Watch 4 on the Pixel 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DJa2JBrhdkhXQtuEgLiKBd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes this feature more interesting is that it will also automatically lock your phone if you walk away from it while it is still unlocked. This could be especially useful from a privacy standpoint if you accidentally leave your phone behind in a public place. The report also notes that you will be able to disable these alerts in trusted locations, such as your home.</p><p>That said, it is possible that Google may limit this feature to select new Pixel Watch models and some older models, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/final-farewell-googles-first-pixel-watch-receives-its-last-minor-update">original Pixel Watch</a> or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-pixel-watch-4-vs-pixel-watch-2">Pixel Watch 2</a>, may be left out. The code strings include a "Not supported watch" message, suggesting that some Pixel Watch variants could miss out.</p><p>For those familiar, similar features already exist on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/apple-watch/apple-watch-series-11-vs-google-pixel-watch-4">Apple Watch</a> and Samsung Galaxy Watch, but it is good to finally see Google working on bringing this functionality to the Pixel Watch.</p><p>There is no word yet on when or if this feature will officially roll out, as it has only been spotted in the source code so far. If Google does end up releasing it, we will be sure to update you.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This feature appears to be the evolution of another intrusion tool that was reported early last year. The post states this feature will likely find a home in Android's Advanced Protections settings with a description that reads, "Preserves encrypted logs of some device activity in case of a security issue."</p><p>This is toggleable. If, when this arrives, users don't want to have this enabled, they're not forced to. However, after surfacing the feature early, the tipster's findings show that Google will connect users to a "trusted expert" if they need help after noticing suspicious digital movement.</p><p>These activity logs can only be accessed by using your Google account and lock screen credentials. According to a screenshot, what these logs will contain is reportedly "device connections, app installs, the last time your phone screen was unlocked, 'some' browsing history, and other data."</p><p>Seeing as these logs are incredibly important (and potentially sensitive), Google's code suggests it will house this for 12 months on its Cloud servers. However, there's a crucial note: these logs cannot be deleted manually. They will be removed from Google's Cloud servers on their own in 12 months.</p><h2 id="heightened-defenses-2">Heightened Defenses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:265px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:226.42%;"><img id="eQTA6uBBavT5b3kmQ2oQjW" name="android-16-intrusion-logging-feature-leak-details" alt="Android 16 reportedly preps an "Intrusion Logging" feature, which helps to keep track and alert users to suspicious activity regarding their device." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eQTA6uBBavT5b3kmQ2oQjW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="265" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There seems to be a little bit of a name change here. When this feature was first rumored, it was called "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-intrusion-detection-advanced-protection-code">Intrusion Detection</a>." Moreover, the feature was originally speculated to debut alongside Android 16 last year, but that never came to pass. Instead, those early rumors claimed Intrusion Detection would alert users to any suspicious activity regarding their device.</p><p>These encrypted logs about activity, which we've seen the tipster highlight today, were mentioned last year, too.</p><p>Strangely, the rumors then stated those logs would be placed in Google Drive (encrypted, still). The rumors seem to have changed, as the company might've opted to house them differently.</p><p>While it appears as though Intrusion Logging is mostly fleshed out, there's still no telling when it could roll out. There's hope that it's soon, though, as Google just debuted <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-qpr3-beta-2-released">Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2</a> this week. The update had an extensive list of fixes for enrolled Pixel phones for crashes, notification issues, and more. Perhaps we'll see Intrusion Logging appear with the next Android 16 QPR release.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Almost no one reading this article would ever buy one. But its arrival, so close on the heels of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-fenix-8-pro-announced-with-lte-satellite-and-microled-key-highlights">Fenix 8 Pro</a>, gives Garmin fans a reason to hope that more affordable "Garmin X Pro" watches will arrive this year.</p><p>The first two Pro watches added LTE-M cellular and InReach connectivity to Skylo satellites. Current <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watches</a> with messaging or live-tracking capabilities depend on your phone; these new models let you signal an SOS, broadcast your GPS location, or send messages and voice memos.</p><p>Satellite on smartwatches is a vital safety feature, one that's increasingly available on mainstream smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Google Pixel Watch 4</a>. And cellular connectivity ensures you're less dependent upon your phone to stay connected with family on long hikes.</p><p>It benefits Garmin to lean into its own satellite option, packed into watches that last significantly longer than competing brands. That's why I'm hoping that Garmin won't limit its satellite or LTE upgrades to its most expensive models, so more people can use them.</p><h2 id="why-i-expect-more-garmin-pro-watches-this-year-2">Why I expect more Garmin Pro watches this year</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8192px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh" name="Garmin-Fenix-8-Pro-press-photo-4" alt="A photo of a person kayaking while wearing a Garmin Fenix 8 Pro, using it to call someone using LTE cellular data." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/okKMT5B8g8bfLdHtTzrvBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8192" height="4608" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Fenix 8 Pro </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Garmin)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If more Garmin Pro watches are coming, the Kansas-based brand will start with its other premium models: a Tactix 8 Pro for soldiers, D2 Mach 2 Pro for pilots, Descent Mk3 Pro for divers, or MARQ Pro series for, well, rich people.</p><p>But Garmin's stock crashed last year when not enough people bought the uber-expensive Fenix 8 Pro, and it's unclear if people will spend another $1K–3K for LTE and satellite on top of the same features. The new Fenix 9 and Enduro 4 will prop Garmin profits back up this summer, but that won't be enough for shareholders expecting continued growth in every category.</p><p>As I explained in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wearables-2026-what-we-expect-want-to-see">2026 fitness watch predictions</a>, Garmin usually releases new models on a two-year cadence, and after a crammed 2025, we can't expect an Instinct 4, Venu 5, Forerunner 980, Vivoactive 7, or other mainline releases.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BbFPYv7tWFFFG2ENfZUGq5" name="Garmin-Venu-2-Plus-hero.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Venu 2 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BbFPYv7tWFFFG2ENfZUGq5.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Garmin Venu 2 Plus introduced key features before the Venu 3 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the past, Garmin has filled these off years with partial upgrades, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-2x-solar-review">Instinct 2X</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/garmin-venu-2-plus-review">Venu 2 Plus</a>. Garmin could follow this pattern in 2026 (and attempt to maintain its profits) by re-releasing its best 2025 models with LTE and satellite capabilities, including the Instinct 3 Pro, Venu 4 Pro, and Forerunner 570 Pro, among others.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-instinct-3-review">Instinct 3</a> is the most obvious fit, since it's tailored to hikers, but I could just as easily see trail runners preferring a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-970-review">Forerunner 970</a> spinoff with satellite capabilities. And Garmin could theoretically stick to LTE for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin/garmin-venu-4-review">Venu 4</a> Pro, since its target audience might not benefit as much from satellite connectivity and would prefer a thinner design.</p><p>My preference would be a Forerunner 970 Pro or Venu X1 Pro, though the latter might be too skinny to make this work. The wider the selection of Garmin Pros, the safer people will be on long hikes and trail runs — and the more InReach subscriptions Garmin will sell.</p><h2 id="the-main-hurdle-to-more-garmin-pro-watches-the-antennas-2">The main hurdle to more Garmin Pro watches: The antennas</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="hEceEPkZs6qZjVofdSqzGc" name="Garmin-Instinct-3-AMOLED-design" alt="The right side of the Garmin Instinct 3 50mm AMOLED, the photo focused on the two buttons and orange aluminum bezel, with blurred rocks in the background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEceEPkZs6qZjVofdSqzGc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Fenix 8 Pro 47mm measures 16mm thick, 2.2mm thicker than the non-Pro model. It's exactly the same for the Quatix 8 (13.8mm) and Quatix 8 Pro (16mm). Both Pro models also weigh slightly more (4g).</p><p>When Garmin released the Fenix 8 Pro, it told <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.dcrainmaker.com/2025/09/garmin-fenix-8-pro-lte-microled-satellite-messaging-hands-on-everything-you-need-to-know.html">DCR</a> that it couldn't sell a 43mm model "due to hardware limitations with integrating the LTE antenna." Both it and the InReach antenna were apparently too difficult to incorporate into a smaller design.</p><p>This means that a hypothetical Venu 4 Pro would only be available in the larger 45mm model. And since the Venu 4 measures 12.5mm thick, would the Venu 4 Pro need to be about 15mm thick to incorporate Garmin's antennas, or also 16mm? That would certainly detract from its style a bit.</p><p>Likewise, since the Garmin Instinct 3 already measures about 14.5–15mm thick, would a Pro version need to measure 17mm, or would its current thickness leave room for the new antennas? These are the design challenges that Garmin engineers are (hopefully) solving right now.</p><p>Whatever the case, I think plenty of Garmin fans will accept a thicker design if the Pro models remain relatively lightweight with consistent battery life, and offer them the peace of mind that comes with having satellite for worst-case scenarios.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But with a toddler in the house, it's just not feasible to get any gaming time, and while my wife manages to play Valorant for a few hours a week, the only game I played to any meaningful extent in the last year is Balatro.</p><p>This is where a service like GeForce Now comes in handy. At the outset, cloud gaming is all about convenience; you don't have to worry about hardware or configuration, and you can just focus on the game itself. While Microsoft has its own take on cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass, I like what NVIDIA is doing with GeForce Now a lot better — the service lets me play my own games on the cloud, and that's just great.</p><p>NVIDIA is on a mission to bring <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/geforce-now">GeForce Now</a> to as many platforms as possible. It's now available natively on select Amazon streaming products alongside Samsung and LG smart TVs. What I particularly like is that there's a native Linux app, and the timing couldn't have been better; I'm getting increasingly frustrated with Windows (I just can't stand Windows 11) and have been mulling a wholesale switch to Ubuntu.</p><p>Linux gaming in general is much better than it was even a few years ago, and having a utility like GeForce Now available natively makes all the difference. In addition to expanding availability to other platforms, NVIDIA added flight stick integration to GeForce Now, and that is intriguing in and of itself when you consider the fact that the game itself is being streamed via a remote location.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-26.jpg" alt="Black Myth Wukong via NVIDIA GeForce Now on the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BNBBZBHL5yK9o3RckWC4M.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At CES 2026, NVIDIA showed off Microsoft Flight Simulator running on GeForce Now, and I was able to use a Logitech HOTAS to control the demo. While I'm abysmal with a flight stick, I at least noted that the input was near-instantaneous, and at no point did I feel that the game was being streamed via the cloud. More than anything else, this is what makes GeForce Now stand out.</p><p>The second part of the puzzle is availability; GeForce Now is available in over 60 countries globally, but there's an India-sized hole that NVIDIA is looking to remedy. The service was meant to debut in India last year, but that has been pushed to sometime in 2026, and with NVIDIA hosting the service on its own, I can't wait for it to become available. Microsoft rolled out cloud gaming in the country a few months ago, and with NVIDIA's imminent arrival, gamers in the country will get more choice, and that's always a good thing.</p><p>In my usage, I prefer GeForce Now as it lets me play the games I already own. I have an extensive catalog of Steam games I didn't get around to playing, and I have over a hundred titles on Epic I didn't even bother installing until now. Having the ability to play those games on any device is just convenient, and GeForce Now has the best image fidelity thanks to its use of custom RTX 5080 to power it. Now I just need to wait for the service to launch in the country so I don't have to use a VPN tunnel to play my games on the cloud.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the publication, Google's patent supposedly held details about a rework for how its battery is packaged in the device. Specifically, the company might chase a "removable battery" strategy, as opposed to one that's glued.</p><p>The publication, tipster collab discovered that Google could deploy "Shear stops." It was stated that this could "prevent the battery from sliding inside the smartphone frame."</p><p>The post claims that the patent went into more detail, stating that, since there's no glue, the Pixel 11 Pro Fold's battery could be slipped into a "metal battery frame." Early information purports that this is a chassis that the battery would sit inside, carrying the "electrical ground and adds strength." Moreover, Google could implement a spring-loaded mechanism.</p><p>These springs would help press the battery against the device's metal frame to ensure maximum connection.</p><p>The publication highlights this as a positive change, considering that glue can end up becoming a repairability nightmare over time. Take this with a grain of salt; there's no clear indication that this battery change will arrive for the Pixel 11 Pro Fold, as patents are never a true telltale sign.</p><h2 id="maybe-it-ll-be-better-next-time-2">Maybe it'll be better next time</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5038px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="qD4G8QBwFiSsKyCpsKtRi" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qD4G8QBwFiSsKyCpsKtRi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5038" height="2838" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>A future Pixel Pro Fold with enhanced durability is probably in Google's best interest, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-pro-fold-smokes-up-and-explodes-during-jres-durability-test">especially after it failed</a> Zach Nelson's (JerryRigEverything) test.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold, as most phones do, underwent Nelson's gruesome durability gauntlet, and it wasn't the same.

I spoke with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/drakkenridge/6353835768070984/">DrakkenRidge</a> developer Cyril Guichard about the changes over the years, something he knows a lot about, as he's shipped 5 games since the days of the Oculus Go. Guichard shared that developing for Meta's Start Program from 2019-2022 was "the best experience I've ever had working with a publisher." But, since then, things have gone downhill.</p><p>Meta's goals began shifting after this time, and continued to change seemingly every six months, never long enough to see any goal properly executed. Meta is known for chasing trends as fast as it can and often moving without understanding the true repercussions of its actions. As Meta's Mark Zuckerberg once said about new Facebook features back in 2014, "move fast and break things."</p><p>And broke things, they have. January 13, 2026, will go down as a date that no one in the VR community will likely forget. Android Central reached out to Meta for comment on this article, but didn't receive a response in time for publishing.</p><h2 id="a-virtual-bloodbath-2">A virtual bloodbath</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4" name="meta-horizon-app-mobile-games-with-meta-quest-3" alt="Mobile games in the Meta Horizon app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9GiYBHqbVUNdzkifVsHPM4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On January 13, 2026, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/reality-labs-january-2026-rumored-cuts">Meta closed</a> most of its first-party game development studios. The few employees remaining at studios like Within and Camouflaj will likely be holding "maintenance" duty on live service titles like Supernatural, while Camouflaj's remaining developers are said to be working on an onboarding tutorial that users will experience when they start up the next Meta Quest headset.</p><p>After speaking with many developers, many of whom wanted to remain anonymous for this story, I was told that Oculus Publishing has also seen substantial cuts. Many developer relations contacts within the Meta Horizon Start Program, a developer incubation and funding program, have been laid off, with "just a handful" remaining, per one source. Almost certainly, this means that the $60 million Meta has allegedly spent to fund VR games so far in 2026 is the last we'll see from the program.</p><p>As such, the massive shift didn't just affect first-party Oculus Studios development. Cloudhead Games, maker of the uber-popular Pistol Whip rhythm shooter VR game, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/cloudhead-games-lay-off-70-percent-staff-2026/">laid off</a> 70% of its workforce. Skydance Games has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/harry-potter-vr-game-cancelled-report/">reportedly also canceled</a> an official Harry Potter VR game due to funding program shifts within Meta. The total extent of the fallout remains to be seen, but it's not looking pretty.</p><p>As Anshel Sag, Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told me, "I think Meta is destroying all of the goodwill it created as the 'savior' of VR gaming. I think Meta is causing irreparable damage to the industry, both in how it acquired these companies and how it's run them and their properties."</p><h2 id="the-vr-gaming-recession-has-begun-2">The VR gaming recession has begun</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="yEqLoxLpVofgGAN5uSbkb9" name="meta-quest-3-controller-with-AMVR-grips-01.jpg" alt="Grabbing a Meta Quest 3 controller that has AMVR grips attached" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yEqLoxLpVofgGAN5uSbkb9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What does all this mean for VR gamers and developers? For starters, Meta no longer seems to be interested in making first-party games, but there's no evidence that Meta is abandoning VR altogether or even exiting the hardware market. If anything, Meta seems to be taking a "Valve approach" to gaming, which means it'll focus on a wild west-style digital marketplace and only develop hardware.</p><p>Valve rarely invests in projects unrelated to its own ambitions, mostly of which comprise its IPs like Half-Life and Counter-Strike, plus software investment into tools like Proton and FEX, the latter of which makes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/steam-frame-steam-deck-meta-quest-3">the upcoming Steam Frame</a> standalone VR headset possible. Valve has publicly stated it does not have any VR games in development, and Meta seems to be following the same tactic.</p><p>Meta recently announced that Horizon OS, which powers Quest headsets, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reportedly-scraps-horizon-os-partners-to-focus-on-the-quest">will no longer be going third-party</a>, which means it'll only be built for Meta's own hardware. Project Phoenix, pictured in a mockup below, is said to be the Quest 4's form factor, favoring a more smart-glasses-like size and shape with VR headset capabilities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.32%;"><img id="w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN" name="reality-labs-phoenix-mock-up-luna" alt="A mock-up of Reality Labs' Phoenix ultralight VR headset prototype made by Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2634" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Lunayian on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/vr-xr-2026-what-we-expect-want-to-see">I made predictions</a> about the XR market in 2026, I didn't expect the industry to shift focus so hard and fast, particularly for Meta. Not only is Meta seemingly abandoning the idea of becoming the next Nintendo or Sony, but it's pivoting hard to trying to become the first company to produce truly mass-market smart glasses by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/meta-to-boost-ray-ban-smart-glasses-production-amid-surging-demand-aiming-for-20-million-units">doubling or tripling the output</a> of its Ray-Ban and Oakley glasses this year.</p><p>The result is that we're almost certainly not going to see big-name titles hit VR headsets for a long while. Meta-funded AAA titles like Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, Batman Arkham Shadow, Asgard's Wrath 2, Deadpool VR, and many others of its caliber relied entirely on Meta funding, which has now significantly dried up.</p><p>Even indie games will be affected, as several developers have historically relied on the Meta Start Program to fund their salaries during development. "Nearly every indie megahit in the last 5 years came from the Start program first," VR developer RJ told me in a written interview on X (formerly Twitter), and that spells trouble for future releases.</p><h2 id="cutting-off-your-nose-to-spite-your-face-2">Cutting off your nose to spite your face</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC" name="meta-quest-2-pro-3-straight.jpg" alt="The Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and Meta Quest 3 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gy6tBWc4LzPPznAaFTLSjC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Many people are, understandably, pissed off at Meta, and with good reason. More than one developer has now told me that they're considering dropping future development for <em>all</em> Meta hardware, including any potential smart glasses apps, because of the way Meta has handled things over the past 2-3 years. January 13 was just the straw that broke the camel's back.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/xrdevrob/status/2011349410329112692?s=20">One developer</a> simply said, "Give me one reason to keep building for Meta Quest and/or Meta wearables." While some responses have been positive, most people seem to feel like Meta just blew its last ounce of goodwill with this move. Meta has, essentially, put itself in Google's unenviable position of being accused of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://killedbygoogle.com/">killing projects</a> too early.</p><p>While some investors and financial publications have been calling for these moves for years, Meta has largely resisted full-on cuts like this because it seemed to be aiming for a specific vision of the future, but never truly stuck with a plan long enough to bear fruit.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4vdPneyyG52ziTt3Mgfmia" name="meat-quest-3s-with-box-2025" alt="A Meta Quest 3S with the Meta Breathable Facial Interface attached, next to the Meta Quest 3S 256GB box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4vdPneyyG52ziTt3Mgfmia.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Circling back around to Guichard and his development experience over the lifetime of the Quest family since 2019, it's clear the "wonder years" were from 2019-2022. Once Meta began changing tactics and laying off staff, things (unsurprisingly) got worse.</p><p>The magic of the curated Quest store started evaporating overnight when Meta got rid of its curation system in Summer 2024. Games that used to have to pass rigorous QA processes were now greenlit after "the most basic of VR tests," according to several developers I've spoken to. Swaths of Gorilla Tag clones suddenly flooded the market, and Meta started prioritizing Horizon Worlds over paid content, causing legitimately good games to be drowned out.</p><p>Several months later, developers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/quest-developers-are-joining-forces-to-solve-the-vr-visibility-crisis">banded together to help solve</a> the "visibility crisis." While Meta has somewhat helped clean up the curation process in the 18 months since these choices were made, the damage was irreparable. Despite delivering the bigger, better games Meta was calling for from its Start Program developers, the company seemed to have forgotten to follow through on its promises.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Rw2hkFvvjgqhizkWKkNkRZ" name="meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-official-lifestyle-halo" alt="A visual representation of Halo gameplay on a Quest 3S" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Rw2hkFvvjgqhizkWKkNkRZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Microsoft / Meta)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, the reason we have so many VR releases these days is because of Meta's Start Program. As VR analyst <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/2011452375878508995?s=20">Brad Lynch said</a>, "The market has been inorganic and propped up. Everyone was fooled."</p><p>Meta has long provided excellent opportunities for VR developers to make games people care about and want to play, and for its part, deserves credit in attempting to solve the "chicken and egg" scenario VR has been in for years.</p><p>In other words, without Meta's critical funding, we likely never would have seen the AAA titles we got, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/its-time-for-the-meta-quest-to-focus-on-stability-not-capability">years of fiddling</a> with the Quest's digital marketplace may very well have driven out any real chance of long-term success.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CvqfJCTdHVifBz5A8H4q65" name="Batman-Arkham-Shadow-Screenshot-04" alt="A screenshot from Batman Arkham Shadow taken on a Meta Quest 3 headset" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CvqfJCTdHVifBz5A8H4q65.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While Batman Arkham Shadow exceeded internal sales expectations, even those numbers are substantially lower than what's needed to sustain a thriving AAA ecosystem like what's enjoyed on the PS5. Even big indie games like DrakkenRidge are selling 15x lower numbers of units than the developer's previous games, a direct result of Meta's toying with things rather than trying to maintain stability.</p><p>From here on out, it's clear that VR developers will need to be cautious about investments and which platforms to prioritize. Without Meta's financial backing, projects that were once zero risk will now suddenly face big stakes. If boutique VR publishers also pull out, as some fear they might, it's going to be another long, quiet road for VR until the next round of funding hits in a few years from now.</p><p>Until then, I'll keep enjoying excellent VR games like Walkabout Mini Golf and Deadly Delivery with friends.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Reliable tipster @MysteryLupin says the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/google-pixel-10a">Google Pixel 10a</a> will launch early and could be even cheaper than the last model.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Retailer listings suggest the Google Pixel 10a could launch on Feb 17, 2026.• 128 GB: ~€500Colors: Obsidian, Berry, Lavender, Fog• 256 GB: ~€600Color: Obsidian• Official cases: ~€20Colors match phone lineup<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/2011134750979997802">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>If the new leak is accurate, the phone could launch on February 17, which is much earlier than usual. This <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/word-on-the-street-is-the-pixel-10a-is-headed-for-shelves-in-february">matches an earlier leak about the release date</a>.</p><p>The main news is that the 128GB Pixel 10a is expected to cost about €500 in Europe.</p><p>For context, the Pixel 9a launched at €549. In a market where most companies blame price hikes on inflation, a €50 price drop is rare.</p><p>Direct currency conversions are tricky (about $582), but this European price suggests Google may aim for a price below $499 in the U.S. It could even be as low as $449, which would beat many competitors.</p><h2 id="the-trade-off-2">The trade-off</h2><p>Before you get too excited, it’s important to see how Google might make this possible. Rumors say the specs are very similar to last year’s model. The device is expected to use the same Tensor G4 chipset as the Pixel 9a, instead of the newer G5 chip found in the flagship series.</p><p>Leaked images show a phone that looks almost the same as last year’s model. The specs also match, with 8GB of RAM and a 5,100mAh battery.</p><p>Even though the hardware might be the same, the colors are new. The 128GB model is tipped to land in four colors: Obsidian, Berry, Lavender, and Fog. If you need the larger 256GB storage (priced around €600), just make sure you like black, because Obsidian is the only leaked option for the higher tier.</p><p>By apparently recycling the chassis and processor, Google may sidestep the component price hikes plaguing other manufacturers. It may seem like a small update, but for anyone wanting a reliable camera and clean software under $500, it’s a win.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Out of the gate, MediaTek states these chips are designed to bolster the flagship and premium phone markets, as it looks to bring more competition to Qualcomm. The Dimensity 9500s takes center stage, built on a 3nm process and rocking MediaTek's All-Big-Core structure.</p><p>This structure includes a Cortex-X925 ultra core, clocked at speeds up to 3.73GHz. MediaTek paired it with three Cortex-X4 premium cores and four Cortex-A720 performance cores.</p><p>Though it features that "S" tag, the company says this chip can still join the big leagues with a flagship NPU. This NPU is designed to handle "generative reasoning and multi-modal models" for a phone's camera and "content generation capabilities." Essentially, this concerns the post-processing of live photos, AI photo editing tools, AI summaries, and more.</p><p>Speaking of creating content, the Dimensity 9500s features the MediaTek Imagiq image processor for 30fps motion tracking and 8K full-focus Dolby Vision HDR recording.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:973px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:61.66%;"><img id="VSVJW3aTixeA9yPyu8a287" name="mediatek-dimensity-9500s-info" alt="The MediaTek Dimensity 9500s aims to the premium and flagship phone markets with strong GPU and NPU upgrades to help users with games and AI tools." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VSVJW3aTixeA9yPyu8a287.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="973" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: MediaTek)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Power and content generation are major highlights for the Dimensity 9500s; however, MediaTek's not shying away from its gaming power.</p><p>The 9500s features an Immortalis-G925 GPU, capable of handling intensive games, such as Genshin Impact, Wuthering Waves, and more.

Unlike the 9500s, the 8500 offers eight Cortex-A725 cores with speeds up to 3.4GHz.</p><p>MediaTek focused its efforts elsewhere with the 8500, as it debuts it with "accurate scheduling technology and LPDDR5X 9600Mbps memory" support. The post states this was done to help foster a smoother phone experience for Android users, as well as a device battery life that can go further.</p><p>The Mali-G720 GPU aims to reduce power consumption by 25% when compared with MediaTek's older generation. This SoC also upgraded its gaming engine, bringing faster loading times, higher energy efficiency, and more to mobile gamers.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, Mediatek <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/mediatek/mediatek-dimensity-9500-is-android-powerhouse-with-major-performance-gains">launched the Dimensity 9500</a> back in September, its response to Qualcomm's major flagship chip reveal.

It also features a charging case, which isn't true of every smart ring, and it's designed with comfort and traditional ring style in mind. You can also get RingConn covers for added design customizability, along with featuring water and dust resistance, sizes 6 through 14, and a few different color options.</p><p>This particular discount is currently only available in the ring's royal gold and future silver colors.

While products from both companies are comparable in many ways, Xreal alleges that Viture's technology is simply <em>too</em> similar to their own to be a coincidence, and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-deals-blow-to-viture-with-patent-victory-and-german-sales-ban">filed a patent lawsuit</a> in late December in Germany to challenge that claim.</p><p>Now, Xreal is taking the fight to another country in which it holds patents — the United States — making the same claims that Viture is unlawfully utilizing Xreal's U.S. Patent No. 11,988,839 in specific models of smart glasses. Xreal specifically names the Viture Pro XR glasses as the model leading to infringement, but states that other Viture glasses may fall under the umbrella, depending on what the court decides.</p><p>Xreal says it's making moves to defend its patents ahead of expected massive market growth in XR glasses. Xreal cites <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/augmented-reality-and-virtual-reality-market">a research firm's claim</a> that the market will grow 6x in the next 10 years, becoming a nearly $700 billion market by 2035.

I spoke with Anshel Sag, Principal Analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, ahead of the news, as he was also briefed on the matter, and he confirmed the dates to me.</p><p>Furthermore, Sag told me that "the patents that Viture has aren't even filed in the US, which is in contrast to XREAL, which has both patents in the US and Germany." Xreal maintains that they hold over 800 patents worldwide and says Viture only holds around 70, although this number is difficult to confirm.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA" name="xreal-eye-installed-on-xreal-one-glasses-01" alt="The Xreal Eye camera installed in a pair of Xreal One smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/L4oVdyvD6KUot5TRSZnAKA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal was founded in Beijing in 2017 and filed the patent in question roughly one year after its founding. Xreal began as Nreal but changed the company name in 2023. Viture was founded in 2021, also in Beijing.</p><p>History often repeats itself, so it's unsurprising to see that Magic Leap sued Xreal, then called Nreal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684164/magic-leap-nreal-light-chi-xu-lawsuit-ar-glasses-design-ripoff">back in 2019</a> over nearly identical claims of using patented designs.

If the courts confirm Xreal's claim, Viture will likely end up needing to pay Xreal a licensing fee or face a product ban in the U.S. and Germany until its designs are changed.

After months of confusion and online speculation, Samsung updated the fine print on its Galaxy AI support pages to make one thing clear: the core Galaxy AI tools you use today will remain free forever.</p><p>When <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-galaxy-ai">Galaxy AI</a> launched with the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung said basic AI features would be free “through 2025.” The fine print made it seem like you might have to pay after that.</p><p>This unclear message left many users unsure if tools like Photo Assist, Writing Assist, or Interpreter would soon cost a monthly fee.</p><h2 id="basic-galaxy-ai-tools-are-locked-in-at-no-cost-2">Basic Galaxy AI tools are locked in at no cost</h2><p>Now, Samsung has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/galaxy-ai/" target="_blank">changed the footnote</a> to say clearly: “Galaxy AI basic features provided by Samsung are free.” The company also makes it clear that future paid options could be added, but only for enhanced tools or features not included in the basic set (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-ai-features-free-3632510/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). Third-party AI features, such as Google’s Circle to Search, are separate and may have their own terms.</p><p>So, what stays free? Samsung lists its basic AI suite in the “Advanced Intelligence” section of its terms. This includes main features like Call Assist, Writing Assist, Photo Assist, Interpreter, Note & Transcript Assist, Browsing Assist, Now Brief, and Audio Eraser.</p><p>Galaxy AI has been central to Samsung’s software strategy since the One UI 6.1 update in 2024, which brought the suite to both <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-phones">flagship Samsung phones</a> and some older devices. These on-device and cloud-based tools are designed to make everyday tasks, such as photo editing and language translation, faster and easier.</p><p>Keep in mind that Samsung has not ruled out paid AI add-ons in the future. The new statement only guarantees that the basic tools will stay free.</p><p>It also leaves room for enhanced features or new services that could cost money later. Third-party AI services are not included in this guarantee and may have their own pricing.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It also boasts powerful performance backed by an Intel chip, an impressive number of ports, and a price tag that feels fair, even before the discount.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant downside is the device's lack of a fingerprint scanner, and the fact that this is the computer's only available configuration. There are also some laptops around this price point that seem to have a better handle on battery life, though perhaps none that match this computer's level of performance.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:125.00%;"><img id="Pi7ajZEnHcHEyEdL3TyiTV" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-render-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Pi7ajZEnHcHEyEdL3TyiTV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-15-6-with-google-ai-amoled-display-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-256gb-storage-neptune-blue/J3ZYG24W5G" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$749.99" data-dimension48="$749.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$749.99</del> <strong>$599.99 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Best Buy is starting the year off right with $150 off the price of our favorite Chromebook Plus on the market, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review">Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus</a>.

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, has launched a dedicated website called <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://chatgpt.com/translate/">ChatGPT Translate</a>, putting it in direct competition with Google's translation service.</p><p>At launch, the service supports over 50 languages and looks familiar to anyone who has used online translation tools. You get two text boxes, one for input and another for the translated output, along with drop-down menus to select the source and target languages. Like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/this-is-everything-in-google-translates-three-big-updates-rolling-out-for-android">Google Translate</a>, ChatGPT Translate also supports automatic language detection.</p><h2 id="openai-quietly-launches-a-new-google-translate-rival-2">OpenAI quietly launches a new Google Translate rival</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:73.94%;"><img id="TDdPgXwYN3FYXV2q7pAWB6" name="chatgpt-translate-working" alt="ChatGPT Translate in action" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TDdPgXwYN3FYXV2q7pAWB6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3300" height="2440" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can start typing text immediately, with translations appearing live as you type. What sets ChatGPT Translate apart, however, is a set of quick prompts below the text boxes.</p><p>These let you refine translations to sound more fluent, business formal, simplified for a child, or tailored for an academic audience. Tapping any of these prompts opens the request directly in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/i-havent-used-chatgpt-since-2023-heres-why-gemini-is-all-the-ai-i-need">ChatGPT</a>, with the original text and refinement instruction already applied.</p><p>The website also mentions support for translating images and files, but those options are not yet available. Unlike Google Translate, ChatGPT Translate currently lacks voice input (on desktop) and features such as full website translation.</p><p>While ChatGPT could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/tech-talk-how-can-ai-translate-text-and-speech-in-real-time">already be used as a translation tool</a> before, this new website gives users a single, dedicated place for fast translations.</p><p>For now, there is no sign of a standalone ChatGPT Translate app or a dedicated section inside the ChatGPT app, and OpenAI has yet to make an official announcement about the tool.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the Android 16 QPR3 beta 2 does not add many new user-facing features, Google has included an extensive list of bug fixes in this update.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/release-notes">According to Google</a>, the Android 16 QPR3 beta 2 build fixes critical system crashes and device freezes, resolves UI glitches affecting the notification shade and app drawer, and addresses an issue where devices ignored battery charging limits. There are also fixes related to connectivity, including reports of slow Wi-Fi performance. Here is the full changelog of what is included in the latest beta build.</p><h2 id="here-s-everything-that-the-android-16-qpr3-beta-2-fixes-2">Here's everything that the Android 16 QPR3 Beta 2 fixes</h2><ul><li>An issue where the app drawer could become unresponsive when scrolling, which required updates to how UI elements were rendered.</li><li>Android Auto incorrectly logs extensive screen time, impacting battery life.</li><li>Graphical glitches and performance degradation when interacting with  the notification shade in full-screen or PiP modes by improving display  rendering.</li><li>An excessive battery drain issue occurring overnight by optimizing background process power consumption.</li><li>An issue where the battery charging limit was not being respected causing devices to charge to 100% instead of the set limit.</li><li>An issue where users experienced slow internet speeds on Wi-Fi due to a Wi-Fi connection bug.</li><li>A crash when accessing radio information settings.</li><li>Users experienced a noticeable delay and lack of feedback when  switching audio outputs to speakerphone during calls; this was resolved  by improving audio routing logic.</li><li>A display issue causing screen flickering when waking the device from Always-On Display by updating system webview.</li><li>An issue where certain apps, including Microsoft applications  managed by Intune, were crashing on startup due to a compatibility  problem with the Android system that has now been resolved.</li><li>An issue causing inconsistent or failed wireless charging and slow wired charging by improving the power management system.</li><li>System crashes that occurred when folding a foldable device with an  app open by fixing an issue with activity lifecycle management during  device state changes.</li></ul><p>Beyond bug fixes, Google has also made noticeable changes to the Settings app UI.

For example, keyboard, gestures, and navigation mode now live under an "Interaction" section, while system updates have their own "Update device" subsection. While search has always been available, the new layout makes it easier to quickly spot and access specific settings.</p><p>Android 16 QPR3 beta 2 is now rolling out as an OTA update for beta testers. The update carries build numbers CP11.251209.007.A1 and CP11.251209.007 and requires <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-install-android-beta">enrollment in the Android Beta Program</a>. It supports Pixel devices ranging from the Pixel 6 series to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 lineup</a>.</p><p>If you prefer not to install the beta via OTA, you can manually <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/16/qpr3/download-ota">flash factory images</a> onto your device. Otherwise, you can wait for the stable Android 16 QPR3 release, which is expected to roll out around March 2026</p> ]]></dc:content>

There are no insurance products available." The original poster made note of that, too, which is where their conundrum begins, as they've nowhere left to turn.</p><h2 id="an-expensive-device-with-an-expensive-issue-2">An expensive device with an expensive issue</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:810px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="3LzW9invuBueiDbATBf8YY" name="samsung-galaxy-z-trifold-left-display-damage" alt="A user's photo of a line of dead pixels down the left-most strip on their Galaxy Z TriFold's main display panel." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3LzW9invuBueiDbATBf8YY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="810" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung Community Forum)</span></figcaption></figure><p>All isn't lost (well, not entirely), <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EA%B0%A4%EB%9F%AD%EC%8B%9C-z/%ED%8A%B8%EB%9D%BC%EC%9D%B4%ED%8F%B4%EB%93%9C-%EC%95%A1%EC%A0%95%EC%9D%B4-%EB%82%98%EA%B0%94%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/td-p/36534076#:~:text=It%20won%27t%20cost%20much.%20You%20can%20use%20a%2050%25%20coupon%20and%0Aget%20it%20fixed%20for%20about%201.3%20million%20won.">as one user</a> reminds the original poster about the 50% coupon for their first repair. Still, the price is likely to sit on the distasteful side, as Galaxy Z TriFold parts aren't cheap by any degree.</p><p>Durability concerns, especially for foldables, are always in question. The devices are, quite literally, built differently, and the idea of needing to <em>fold </em>a screen can cause problems. Last summer, there were concerns about Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 7 as show units in stores were <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-z-fold-7-store-display-units-already-showing-signs-of-potential-hinge-damage">already showing problems</a> with their hinges. Users on Reddit who spotted the phones in stores on display said they weren't "unfolding all the way."</p><p>Snapshots taken from stores showed that the devices retained a slight bend when trying to unfold them all the way. Needless to say, they weren't sitting completely flat.</p><p>It was brought to attention that the device in question was probably just a one-off. Issues like this weren't exactly widespread once the device hit consumers' hands, so that's one thing to feel good about. For the Galaxy Z TriFold, it remains to be seen if things evolve further than this one user's report. Though unfortunate, if consumers continue to report this, Samsung might have a bigger issue on its hands.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to Mystic Leaks on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://t.me/mysticleaks/149" target="_blank">Telegram</a>, Android could soon have a cleaner, more organized split instead of one large pull-down for everything.</p><p>Currently, Android’s notification shade and Quick Settings share the same crowded space on stock devices like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a>. Pull down once for notifications, and pull again for toggles. It works, but it’s messy, especially on large phones where everything feels stacked together.</p><p>The latest leak says Google is testing a true split layout in Android 17. This means that swiping from the left edge would show only notifications, while swiping from the right would bring up Quick Settings.</p><p>If this seems familiar, it’s because brands like Samsung and Xiaomi already use a similar approach. The difference is that Google would make this official in Android itself, instead of leaving it to custom skins.</p><p>For regular Pixel users, this change seems to be optional. You’ll probably be able to go to Settings > Notifications and switch between the classic "Combined" view and the new "Separate" layout, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-16-qpr1-split-quick-settings-3562165/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reported earlier.</p><p>However, if you have a tablet or a foldable, you might not have a choice. The leak says split-view mode will be required on large-screen devices. On a Pixel Fold, you could switch to split view on the inner screen, while only the outer screen might let you go back to the classic merged look.

According to the company, Personal Intelligence lets users "personalize" the AI using data stored in their Google apps, like Photos, Gmail, YouTube, and Search. The post states that users can turn Personal Intelligence on or off, and they can decide which Connected Apps Gemini can leverage.</p><p>It states, "When enabled, Gemini accesses your data to answer your specific requests and to do things for you."</p><p>Google gave the example of finding new tires for an older Honda minivan. Since they were unsure of the exact size they needed, they inquired with Gemini. In doing so, the AI went through its Connected Apps in Personal Intelligence to find any relevant details. For the license plate, Gemini dove into Photos to find a picture that showed it clearly. It even suggested the user purchase "all-weather tires" due to a trip they photographed from Oklahoma.</p><p>Regarding the tire's trim, Gemini found those details through information from their Gmail account.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="SL9bmwqmCQoYuUaQzxbBT6" name="google-gemini-personal-intelligence-chat-example" alt="When asking Gemini about a specific question, such as a car's tires, the AI can use data stored in your Google apps, like Photos and Gmail, to find an answer." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SL9bmwqmCQoYuUaQzxbBT6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google states that its goal is to "improve your experience while keeping your data secure and under your control."</p><p>It adds that the information Gemini leverages (content stored in Photos, Gmail, etc.) isn't used to "train" the AI's capabilities. Google says that the data it surfaces, Photos to assist with a purchase, and emails, too, are only "referenced" to complete the reply. To make it simpler, Google says, "We don't train our systems to learn your license plate number; we train them to <em>understand</em> that when you ask for one, we can locate it."</p><p>Additionally, Google highlights its guardrails in place to safeguard your data, specifically, its internal systems. Gemini is trained not to make assumptions about you based on your "sensitive" info, like your health data.</p><h2 id="the-true-ai-assistant-2">The true AI assistant</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="cWcWbhNKKEWko2Wxpdh85c" name="google-gemini-persnal-intelligence-splash" alt="Personal Intelligence for Gemini allows the AI to leverage data stored across a user's Google apps for personalized help." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cWcWbhNKKEWko2Wxpdh85c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MaccABqPtGHYgM4AmUVV4c" name="google-gemini-personal-intelligence-connected-apps" alt="Gemini's Personal Intelligence works with Connected Apps, meaning users can select which apps the AI has access to for answers." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MaccABqPtGHYgM4AmUVV4c.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>As previously stated, Personal Intelligence is rolling out "over the next week" for "eligible" Google AI Pro and AI Ultra users in the U.S. The post states that the rollout will be slow, as it starts with a smaller group of individuals before opening it up to more. After opening the Gemini app, users should see an invitation to hop right in.</p><p>In the event that you don't, Google directs users to the <strong>Gemini app > Settings > Personal Intelligence > Connected Apps</strong>.</p><p>Google stresses that this feature is in beta, meaning Gemini could get some things wrong. If/when that happens, users can easily correct the AI by giving it the right details or by telling it to "remember" what they prefer. Google teases that Personal Intelligence is on its way to more countries and even Gemini's free tier, but that won't happen right away.</p><p>Personal Intelligence works on Android, iOS, and its web view.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's as simple as that. </p><h2 id="get-a-free-pixel-phone-and-earbuds-when-you-add-a-line-at-t-mobile-2">Get a free Pixel phone AND earbuds when you add a line at T-Mobile</h2><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="9a5bbda2-5d43-4798-ba99-1d6000bff724" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe" name="Google-Pixel-10-render-Indigo-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P2VuWjwLCiqD338ULfskKe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 256GB: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" data-dimension112="9a5bbda2-5d43-4798-ba99-1d6000bff724" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$899.99</del><strong> FREE, plus free pair of Pixel Buds 2A with eligible line at T-Mobile</strong></a></p><p>Add a new line with the Experience More or Experience Beyond plan at T-Mobile and the carrier will hook you up with a free Google Pixel 10 AND a pair of Pixel Buds 2A earbuds at no additional cost. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.t-mobile.com/cell-phone/google-pixel-10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="9a5bbda2-5d43-4798-ba99-1d6000bff724" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" data-dimension48="Google Pixel 10 256GB: $899.99" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><em><strong>See all the best T-Mobile deals today</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're ready to make a change to your wireless service and would like to get a couple of great devices out of the deal; you want a great 2025 smartphone with versatile cameras and a ton of AI features.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you're looking for a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-prepaid-carriers-buyers-guide">cheap phone plan</a>; you prefer unlocked phones or trade-in deals.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 boasts a sophisticated design with a 6.3-inch OLED display, outstanding haptics, and Qi2 magnetic charging support straight out of the box, plus you'll enjoy the efficiency of the Tensor G5 chipset with 12GB of RAM.

User responses have been mixed, though, with people reporting inaccurate and unhelpful results. Now, Google is finally rolling out AI notification summaries for Pixel users, and it has a chance to prove that slow and steady wins the race.</p><p>The feature works for notifications from popular messaging apps, condensing long chats into more digestible bites. It's all processed on-device, but the feature is disabled by default, so you'll need to manually enable Android's AI notification summaries if you want to see them. Here's how to do it and customize the feature to match your preferences.</p><h2 id="who-can-use-ai-notification-summaries-and-how-they-work-2">Who can use AI notification summaries (and how they work)</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8960px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vwQF7uSuhiXon7LS3F6mGD" name="AI-Notification-Organizer-1" alt="The Android AI notification summaries on a Google Pixel phone." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vwQF7uSuhiXon7LS3F6mGD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8960" height="5040" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google added AI notification summaries to Android 16 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-finally-fights-notification-overload-and-lets-you-kill-ugly-icons">with a Pixel Drop in December 2025</a>. Notably, the feature is only available for Google Pixel 9 and Pixel 10 series phones, excluding the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9a-review">Pixel 9a</a>.</p><p>Since the summarization happens on-device, the Pixel 9a's smaller 8GB of RAM is presumably not enough to power this tool. This also guarantees the contents of your notifications are never sent to Google. Additionally, summaries are only available in English.</p><p>Notification summaries are designed to work with long messages or group chats from messaging apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, Android Messages, WhatsApp, and others. It's not intended for short texts, so AI summaries will not generate in some cases. AI summaries will only generate if your screen is turned off briefly, and will not appear when you're using your phone.</p><p>When a notification is summarized using AI, a sparkle icon will appear beside the generated text. You can tap the summary to reveal the full message.</p><p>It's worth noting that a separate AI feature for notifications, Notification Organizer, debuted alongside AI summaries. We have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/how-to-set-up-and-use-android-ai-notification-organizer">a full guide to using Notification Organizer here</a> if you want to use both AI features together.</p><h2 id="how-to-set-up-and-use-android-ai-notification-summaries-2">How to set up and use Android AI notification summaries</h2><p>Android 16's AI notification summaries are turned off by default.

However, there's room for customization, as you can pick and choose which app notifications are summarized with AI.</p><p>Here's how to set up and customize Android AI notification summaries:</p><p>1. Open the <strong>Settings app</strong> on a Google Pixel phone.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>Notifications </strong>page and press <strong>Notification summaries</strong>.</p><p>3.

Under <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/ENG/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=Q0010001">Taiwan's Cross-Strait Act</a>, Chinese companies are prohibited from conducting business or hiring employees in Taiwan without explicit government approval.

Their notorious failure hurt that idea, but didn't kill it, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/android-centrals-best-of-ces-2026">CES 2026</a> proved. At least a dozen tech brands, most notably Lenovo, pushed a specific AI concept: small wearable gadgets that record and transcribe everything around you, to remember later.</p><p>People have accepted AI wearables like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ray-ban-meta-gen-2-review">Ray-Ban Meta</a> glasses or smartwatches, with familiar form factors and features <em>besides</em> AI. But tech brands still think they can sell people on an indispensable, specialized AI that you wear everywhere.</p><p>It's not unreasonable to make AI transcription the hook for this concept. Recording apps like Otter are quite popular for meeting notes, and a portable, all-day transcription tool would be quite helpful for things like conventions. But the endgame is to record and analyze <em>everything</em> in your life, and that's not hyperbole.</p><p>Outside the optimistic, credulous CES environment with carefully crafted demos, it's fair to ask whether this always-recording AI future is another bubble ready to burst — or, if these devices <em>do</em> work as intended, if that's a good thing.</p><h2 id="ces-2026-s-surplus-of-wearable-ai-gadgets-briefly-summarized-2">CES 2026's surplus of wearable AI gadgets, briefly summarized</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="4XoPb5ARUEADg8ajUzGRqK" name="pebble-index-press-photo" alt="Photo of a man's folded hands resting on a ledge, with the Pebble Index 01 smart ring on his left index finger and a Pebble smartwatch on his wrist." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4XoPb5ARUEADg8ajUzGRqK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Pebble Index 01 </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Pebble)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The <strong>Pebble Index 01</strong> side-stepped <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-sues-samsung-amazfit-as-it-demands-royalty-payments-from-remaining-smart-ring-rivals">Oura's litigiousness</a> by avoiding health sensors and focusing on transcription: tap the button, say something, and the recording is sent to your phone for a voice-to-text reminder.

When people see you wearing one of these AI pins, they'll assume they're being recorded and/or filmed at all times.

Given how inaccurate my Otter transcriptions tend to be, I'm curious how well these AIs will truly "understand me." Will they successfully tell different speakers apart and counterbalance ambient noise, music lyrics, and other data noise?</p><p>And third, will these "second brain" wearables that summarize our lives really help us, or just give us an excuse to not pay attention, knowing the AI will tell us later what we're <em>supposed</em> to remember?</p><p>Assuming these wearable AI tools work as intended, I could see a market for them. The same folks who rely on ChatGPT for work, data searches, or general advice would want a way to incorporate more personalized data from the real world, so the AI can remind them of what they need to know.</p><p>Personally, as much as I get frustrated when I forget something important, I think I'd rather find ways to improve my memory than to become less dependent upon it, because an AI is surveilling my life and can remember things for me.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Fun names aside, these models are known as Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and Gemini 3 Pro Image. Google put its best image-generation models in users' hands by making Nano Banana Pro available for three images per day, and consumers are clearly loving it.</p><p>Google's vice president of Gemini and Google Labs, Josh Woodward, took to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/joshwoodward" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that users have generated over a billion images with Nano Banana Pro. Woodward noted that this model was only available for 53 days when the major milestone was crossed, signaling that there's significant demand for Nano Banana Pro.</p><p>Since free users only get three Nano Banana Pro generations or edits per day, crossing this threshold suggests <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> users are trying out and returning to the image-generation model. It could also indicate that paid users are taking advantage of Nano Banana Pro access, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-one">Google AI Pro</a> subscribers get 100 images daily and Ultra subscribers get 1,000.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Crossed 1 billion images Nano Banana Pro images in @GeminiApp! The pro community is moving fast.

Although text generation is a typical pain point for AI image generators, Nano Banana Pro crosses this hurdle easily with the ability to write text in a variety of languages. There are applications beyond basic image edits or cartoon-style generations, such as creating presentation slides or educational charts.</p><p>Users can try out detailed prompts that tell Nano Banana Pro exactly what to do, and then watch the magic happen. Since this is a thinking model, you can trace Gemini's steps as it worked on how to tackle the Nano Banana Pro request. In the example below, a long prompt was used to create an isometric miniature representation of a city.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb" name="Gemini-3-7" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Dw7ieTGyMC3hkHe7JXHoqb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You'll notice that not only does the output contain legible text using personalized typography, but it also looks clean and accurately matches the prompt instructions.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro's image-generation performance seems to be driving more people to use the Gemini app, and it isn't the first time. Back in September, Woodward announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-says-nano-banana-drove-in-over-10-million-new-users-to-gemini-app">the standard Nano Banana model drove 10 million users to start using Gemini</a>. At the time, the Gemini VP added Nano Banana edited more than 200 million images in just over a week of availability.</p><p>Now, Nano Banana Pro is following in Nano Banana's footsteps, marking an even bigger milestone with over a billion edits and generations. This is impressive in and of itself, but it's even better for Google considering the wider context of AI image editing today. As competitors find themselves in scandal, Gemini's Nano Banana is emerging as a fan-favorite image generator that is squeaky clean.</p><h2 id="google-s-noncontroversial-image-generator-is-standing-out-2">Google's noncontroversial image generator is standing out</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb" name="Gemini-3-6" alt="Using the new Gemini 3 and Nano Banana Pro models in the Gemini app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Squ3rMCQoXoZ8ftoHTkBxb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Generative AI has been used for nefarious purposes for years, but the average person and global governments are finally understanding the scope of AI image generations and deepfakes, thanks to Grok, Elon Musk's AI chatbot. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/elon-musks-xai-is-paying-telegram-usd300-million-to-integrate-grok-ai">Grok</a> powers image generation in the X (formerly Twitter) app via xAI and makes it easy to create and edit images on X, sometimes of others and of an explicit nature, by simply replying to a post and tagging the AI bot.</p><p>Grok's behavior is nothing new, as the technology has been available on underground sites before. However, it has never been this easy to generate and edit images of others without their consent. It's all happening in public, making Grok's guardrails (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/08/tech/elon-musk-xai-digital-undressing">or lack of them</a>) and generative AI at large a controversial issue. In response, Grok's image generation features were restricted to paid subscribers.</p><p>Things began coming to a head when Malaysia and Indonesia became the first countries to block Grok access due to its unrestricted AI image generation features, as reported by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apnews.com/article/grok-malaysia-indonesia-block-c7cb320327f259c4da35908e1269c225" target="_blank">Associated Press</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.28%;"><img id="XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5" name="New-twitter-logo.jpg" alt="X logo on a phone screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XeWENyMzgGmkw6az5JBUc5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1800" height="1013" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By comparison, Google's Nano Banana Pro-powered image generation features are decidedly noncontroversial, and that's beginning to be valuable. The company's guardrails for Gemini image generation, once criticized as being too restrictive, now stand out as potentially the gold standard for reigning in AI bots. Its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://gemini.google/policy-guidelines/" target="_blank">policy guidelines for the Gemini app</a> prevent Gemini from generating outputs containing violence, gore, explicit material, threats to child safety, harassment, and more.</p><p>Beyond including the necessary training limits, Google is showing off how Nano Banana Pro can benefit users by being a workplace and learning tool. It can generate custom explainers in Google Search's AI Mode, create charts or infographics in NotebookLM, or diagrams in Google Slides, for example. Nano Banana Pro is also available in Google Vids and Flow.</p><p>Crucially, Google watermarks Nano Banana and Nano Banana Pro generations and edits. Anyone can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-can-now-tell-you-whether-a-video-was-generated-with-google-ai">check if an image (or video, for that matter) was generated with Google AI</a> by uploading it to Gemini and asking.</p><p>Google is winning in the AI image generation space on merit, offering a tool consumers want to use, as evidenced by Nano Banana Pro generating over a billion images in under two months. Perhaps more important is that Google isn't compromising principles to win the AI race. Google's image-generation models aim to be safe and transparent at a time when competitors look to be doing the exact opposite.</p> ]]></dc:content>

These components are critical to smartphones, with DRAM used for RAM and NAND used for storage.</p><p>According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/CYBERPOWERPC/status/1993126805658911041">CyberPowerPC</a>, global memory prices have surged by as much as 500%, while SSD prices are up nearly 100%, with no immediate signs of cooling down. If these increases were temporary, brands could have absorbed the costs and waited for prices to normalize.</p><p>However, that does not appear to be the case, meaning the higher costs are now likely to be passed on to consumers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/getpeid/status/2011264565598912657">Pei took to X</a> to say that smartphone prices, including Nothing's own devices, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-why-your-next-phone-will-cost-more">will increase in 2026</a>. He noted that the industry has long operated under the assumption that smartphone components would inevitably become cheaper over time, but that assumption no longer holds true.</p><h2 id="why-smartphone-prices-will-increase-in-2026-2">Why smartphone prices will increase in 2026</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA" name="Nothing-Phone-3a-Pro-Phone-2-vs-2" alt="The Nothing Phone 3a and 3a Pro." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SLExDmBSVbqsgXmho6v3zA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the increase is driven by competition for the same memory components used in AI data centers. As smartphones and AI infrastructure now compete directly for DRAM and NAND supply, prices have risen sharply as a result.</p><p>Pei added that memory costs have already increased by up to three times and are quickly becoming one of the most expensive components in a smartphone. This has significantly raised the bill of materials for manufacturers, with some estimates suggesting memory modules that cost under $20 a year ago could exceed $100 by the end of the year for top-tier devices.</p><p>As a result, your next smartphone is likely to be more expensive than it otherwise would have been.

The patch, as detailed on Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb">Security Updates</a> page, contains 21 fixes for these devices. Among these, 19 are marked as "High" priority fixes, while two settle for the "Critical" tag.</p><p>Samsung states it's rolling out a fix for CVE-2026-20969, which concerns an issue where attackers could inappropriately "access file with system privileges." Other fixes were included to fix vulnerabilities with attackers accessing out-of-bounds memory, a bypass for Carrier Relock, and more.</p><p>In actuality, as SamMobile notes, the entire patch holds roughly 55 fixes for Samsung's latest flagship models. As always, Google's side holds a bit more, as per its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2026/2026-01-01">Android Security Bulletin</a>. Google detailed one critical fix en route for devices with Dolby components.</p><p>The post highlights that the January patch bears vBYLR. Users should know that the patch is slowly making its rounds in South Korea. It's not out of the norm, but users should likely prepare to see the patch hit the U.S., Europe, and other areas late this week, if not the week after.</p><h2 id="prepare-for-more-updates-2">Prepare for more updates</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-android-logo" alt="The "Powered by Android" screen that appears when booting up a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6w5UthvdBXHJwg7fEnzRfB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As previously stated, this is the second January patch that Samsung has rolled out for the Galaxy S25 series; however, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-3-lands-on-galaxy-s25-with-bug-fixes-and-january-security-patch">the first was for One UI 8.5 Beta testers</a>. A few days after New Year's, Samsung pushed a patch to its beta testers for its 8.5 Beta 3. The update was a massive 1.2GB download for users, further strengthening its enormous number of fixes for bugs. Among them, Samsung aimed to fix lock screen glitches, gallery lag, widget bugs, and much more.</p><p>The One UI 8.5 beta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-beta-reportedly-delayed">started a little later</a> than previously expected, likely due to issues Samsung had with its S26 series. The company was reportedly busy trying to narrow down the devices it wanted to offer consumers in 2026, which seems to be the S26, S26 Plus, and an S26 Ultra, per usual.</p><p>As you'd expect, this updated software is positioned as a much grander update, nothing like a smaller 8.1 update. Rumors suggest that this update will arrive alongside the Galaxy S26 series before rolling out to other models, like the S25.</p> ]]></dc:content>

We’re getting an early peek at the software that may make this all possible.</p><p>A Reddit user seems to have spotted the companion app for Google's smart glasses.  They managed to snag it by running the Android Studio preview release and setting the API to Canary preview. What's more notable is that the software seems to align with what Google mentions in their own support docs (as spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/glasses-companion-app-3631808/">Android Authority</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1850px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:62.05%;"><img id="6bqobrk8jKQRsWeb6fcLZB" name="Google-XR-smartglasses-app-leak" alt="Google's smart glasses app leak hints at major features in the works" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:44,l:0,cw:1850,ch:1041,q:80/6bqobrk8jKQRsWeb6fcLZB.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1850" height="1148" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, the publication posted screenshots of the Canary preview that show a "Glasses" app for Google's Android XR smart glasses. It also seems to come with a package name "com.google.android.glasses.companion."</p><p>The screenshots show how users can pair their smart glasses, with a prompt stating, "Set up your Glasses now, or discover your next pair on the Google Store.” That said, the purchasing link for the glasses is currently inactive (greyed out) for obvious reasons.</p><p>But the app mentions a physical power that is placed on the right arm of these glasses, and that the LED will pulse blue or white once the glasses are ready to pair.</p><p>For the built-in camera, a settings page indicates you can import photos and videos manually, automatically, or only while charging.

The strings also reveal that all the conversations, images, videos, and other data recorded in the glasses will remain private to the user and will not be shared with either Google or any other company, which is a relief.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi" name="project-aura-tease" alt="Project Aura glasses teased" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mpzwD6hGFTyofSbqWTpXdi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2233" height="1256" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The publication further mentions other strings related to display settings, including options to turn off display, brightness, and toggle an "audio only mode."</p><p>Google seems to be building an ecosystem around its new Android XR platform, and hopefully, we get to see more of these features in action closer to launch sometime this year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After continuously being called out by the community, the company announced its "2026 Service Improvement Plan," which starts with the AYANEO Pocket Play Kickstarter campaign being temporarily paused.</p><p>As outlined on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ayaneo/comments/1qa8t1j/ayaneo_2026_service_improvement_plan/" target="_blank">r/ayaneo subreddit</a> and in a corresponding <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.ayaneo.com/article/911" target="_blank">blog post</a>, AYANEO's Service Improvement Plan is comprised of five different categories. These include the likes of "Shipping & Crowdfunding," along with the "After-Sales Experience." Within the plan, there are various targets and tasks, such as the new "<em>help@ayaneo.com</em>" email address, a "repair guarantee," and even plans to launch an "overseas warehouse."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2376px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:134.22%;"><img id="U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi" name="ayaneo-service-improvement-plan-graphic" alt="AYANEO 2026 Service Improvement Plan graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U23GgFHWYgsPC9KsZWDFEi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2376" height="3189" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: AYANEO)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For years, AYANEO and other Chinese-based gaming handheld manufacturers have relied on the likes of Kickstarter and Indiegogo as to fund its various products. The way it works is that essentially a product is announced, the campaign is opened, money is received, and the devices are shipped after the campaign reaches its goal and production begins. However, AYANEO has been treating Indiegogo more like a traditional storefront, with the campaigns reaching its goals almost instantly, mostly due to low goals being set.</p><p>The problem is that some are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/android-games/android-gaming-handhelds-are-awesome-but-theres-an-ugly-side-to-the-space-that-im-tired-of-ignoring">waiting months and months</a> to receive a device from AYANEO directly, while others are able to head over to AliExpress or even Best Buy and get one much sooner.

Unfortunately, that model has been removed entirely, with current shipments now expected to commence "within March."</p><p>Ultimately, this has been a problem in the space for some time, but with AYANEO specifically, it wasn't until creators within the community became more vocal. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/P9FGaj8Jfxg?si=Oi-HYXRd9M4-Y--_" target="_blank">Zu Reviews from Retro Handhelds</a> was one of the first, with Russ from Retro Game Corps following suit in both his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/CImhz8sVEy8?si=kTBNx9m2ba_857Ji" target="_blank">Pocket Vert review</a> and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://youtube.com/post/UgkxPkCrbgsSiVJTKSmLI2rz7cGetxGF8oRi?si=wiiHzcPjfW40uC5c" target="_blank">YouTube Community post</a>.

Regardless of why, what's clear now is that the company is finally ready to make changes. Now, we just have to hope AYANEO follows through on the plan it outlined, and that this doesn't just end up as being a bunch of smoke and mirrors.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And as you might expect, this last-minute update has been causing problems since then.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2-review">OnePlus Watch 2</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-2r-review">Watch 2R</a>, both released in 2024 running Wear OS 4, were originally supposed to receive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5">Wear OS 5</a> between July and September 2025; only after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-watch-2-missing-wear-os-5-update-3606156/">Android Authority</a> asked about the delay in October did the company say the update would arrive "in the near future."</p><p>Now, <em>some</em> OnePlus Watch owners have received the update, though not everyone; my U.S.-based OnePlus Watch 2R, for example, still shows Wear OS 4 and the May 2025 security update. But this might be a blessing in disguise, given the update's effect.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="nZiXpT7tg2oRywSpkeECbb" name="OnePlus-Watch-2R-battery.jpeg" alt="The battery life summary on the OnePlus Watch 2R.

The Watch 2 and 2R regularly lasted about three days in smart mode before the update; now, some users say it won't last a full day, even after trying factory resets and other fixes.</p><p>"I'm utterly heartbroken and frustrated with the drastic battery drain issue plaguing my OnePlus Watch 2 following the Wear OS 5 update," says one user. "My OnePlus Watch 2 now plummets from full charge at 1:00 PM to a critical 10% by 11:00 PM on light usage."</p><p>"Earlier I used to get 2.5 days easily with most settings on (at least 2 days)... Now barely getting 1 day," says another user. Someone responded that his drain wasn't quite as bad, but that he'd gone from 3–4 days before to "a strict 2 days" now.</p><p>Several users point to specific apps causing the drain, like the Weather app, Play Store, or "Wear OS" itself, but the variety suggests this is a system-wide issue rather than one app causing problems.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH" name="oneplus-watch-3-wear-os-logo" alt="Holding a black OnePlus Watch 3 with the Wear OS logo on its display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kmaCRN8ScFgfRm9u9NRJTH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What makes this update especially frustrating to users is that stock Wear OS 5 is (A) a very subtle update with few notable changes and (B) supposed to make Wear OS<em> </em>run <em>more</em> efficiently, as it did on Pixel and Galaxy Watches. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> has run this version since April with no issues, making this unoptimized update on last-gen models disappointing to see.</p><p>Any brand can push a buggy update, but two weeks later, I'd have expected OnePlus to either roll it back or announce a timetable for fixes. Instead, OnePlus hasn't made any official announcement, from what we've seen. My colleague reached out to OnePlus about the update a few days ago, but we've yet to hear back.</p><p>Having recommended the OnePlus Watch 2R as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch#section-best-budget-option">best budget Android smartwatch pick</a>, mostly on the strength of its battery life, this update is deeply concerning to me. OnePlus needs to prove that its promise of two Wear OS updates and three years of security updates isn't just empty rhetoric, and that it'll properly support these watches.</p><p>As it is, it's notable that the recent OnePlus Watch Lite skipped Wear OS entirely, using a proprietary RTOS like the original OnePlus Watch.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, what stands out in this leak is that the publication <em>and </em>the tipster allege a launch window in February. Quandt's BlueSky posts claims that Google is preparing to launch the mid-range model in "mid-February."</p><p>DroidLife highlighted its own research, and it supposedly discovered retail listings that have posted "similar details." The publication took it a step further, stating that the Pixel 10a could see a specific launch date of February 17, 2026 (that's a Tuesday, in case you're wondering).</p><p>Quandt's post continues with some last-minute device details, suggesting the phone will debut with 128GB and 256GB storage options. Consumers can pretty much expect these totals to remain low, as has been Google's previous trend. The tipster then highlights colors, such as Obsidian, Fog, Lavender, and Berry.</p><h2 id="a-mid-range-10a-2">A mid-range 10a</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE" name="Google Pixel 9a" alt="Google Pixel 9a next to Pixel 8a" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DwFtKFjkXMsLFtvQfRWaAE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As far as colors go, there was an earlier leak last year that kinda-sorta mentioned how "bold" they'd be, but that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-may-launch-much-earlier-withpretty-bold-colors">was based on its supposed wallpapers</a>. A leak from Telegram claimed the Pixel 10a would debut in shades of black, blue, dark blue, red, and green. The "red" could probably be paired with "Berry," while "black" is most likely "Obsidian," now. In other news, there was a huge Pixel 10a leak before the year's end in December, speculating on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/more-pixel-10a-leaks-suggest-specs-close-to-googles-last-mid-range">a device that's not too different</a> from the 9a.</p><p>After a report spotted the phone receiving certification on Verizon's network, specifications highlighted a ~6.3-inch display, a 5,100mAh battery, and an 8/128GB  (RAM/storage) configuration. Moreover, a 48MP main camera was spotted, too.</p><p>The screen is said to be an FHD Plus display, which rounds out specs that make the 10a feel like a 9a. There's hope that the mid-range will be upgraded in other ways, like its Tensor G4, but there's nothing for certain yet. Additionally, it was previously theorized that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10a-surfaces-in-a-new-leak-with-a-nearly-identical-to-pixel-9a">phone could debut in March 2026</a>. While the current leaks go against that, it's still early.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The phone retails for the same $299.99 price tag of its predecessor, but it now comes with strong display protection, the latest Android version, a higher resolution selfie camera, and a larger battery. All of these upgrades should help position it as the ultimate lower mid-range offering. However, Samsung already has a strong contender at this price point with the Galaxy A26.</p><p>Launched in March 2025, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-launches-the-galaxy-a56-5g-a36-5g-and-a26-5g-with-awesome-intelligence">Samsung Galaxy A26</a> has some distinct advantages over the Moto G Power 2026, like more years of OS upgrades, better display tech, and even a lower price after discounts. Choosing between the Moto G Power 2026 vs. Galaxy A26 is not going to be easy, but there are some stark differences which might make one a stronger choice over the other.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-design-and-display-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iG73CHrsqWsTAQSAgqyoPd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has the same design and dimensions as its predecessor. It's not as slim or compact as the Galaxy A26, but it does have superior certifications for toughness. There's an IP68/IP69 rating for the ultimate water ingress protection. You even get MIL-STD-810H certification, which ensures the phone can survive harsh drops and temperatures. The new colors look very nice, too.</p><p>The display of the Moto G Power isn't as impressive on paper compared to Samsung, but it's not bad either. You get a larger 6.8-inch Full-HD+ IPS LCD display with up to 1,000 nits of brightness. The refresh rate is also 120Hz. which has now become sort of a standard for most Android phones. Motorola has improved the shatter protection on the G Power with Gorilla Glass 7i, but this is still not as good as the Victus+ glass on the Galaxy. One good thing is that G Power has a textured TPU back panel, so there's little to no risk of shattering when dropped.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1188px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa" name="Samsung Galaxy A26 all colors" alt="All colors of the Samsung Galaxy A26" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JT3RhN6rpND3aVvVt3D5Qa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1188" height="668" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung really stepped up its game with the Galaxy A26's design. It still has that unmistakable budget look due to the waterdrop display notch and thick bezels at the bottom of the screen, but it gets an IP67 rating now, which wasn't there on the A25. It's slimmer and lighter than the Moto G Power, and you get Gorilla Glass Victus+ for the front and back of the phone. This should give the A26 a more premium in-hand feel, but all the glass on the back is still prone to damage if you're not careful.</p><p>Samsung has started using Super AMOLED screens for most of its phones now, and the Galaxy A26 gets a 6.7-inch panel with a crisp resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. Colors and black levels should be richer and deeper compared to the IPS panel on the Motorola.</p><p>One thing that Samsung has removed, though, is stereo speakers. It's a bizarre move considering the A25 had it. I guess you win some, you lose some.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-hardware-specs-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Hardware & specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld" name="Moto G Power 2026" alt="Moto G Power 2026" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MP7ZQoDNJ8SVkGRXBvt5Ld.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2026 features the MediaTek Dimensity 6300 SoC, which is the exact same one used in the older model, too. Our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/moto-g-power-2025-review">Moto G Power 2025 review</a> should give you a fair idea of what to expect in terms of performance from the 2026 model. The chip is alright for the most part and even handles games fairly well, provided you tone down the quality settings of heavier titles.</p><p>Once again, there's only one variant of the 2026 Moto G Power out there with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. The latter is expandable via a dedicated microSD card slot. The phone also features a headphone jack, stereo speakers, and FM radio — features that are absent in the Galaxy A26.</p><p>The Moto G Power 2026 has a slightly larger battery than the Galaxy should help it last longer per charge, at least on paper. You get 30W wired charging but no wireless charging, which is something the 2025 variant had.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p><strong>Moto G Power 2026</strong></p></th><th  ><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy A26</strong></p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16 (Hello UX), up to 2 OS upgrades</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (One UI), up to 6 OS upgrades</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Pantone Pure Cashmere, Pantone Evening Blue</p></td><td  ><p>Black, White, Mint, Peach Pink</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.7 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,388 x 1,080</p></td><td  ><p>2,340 x 1,080</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, IPS LCD</p></td><td  ><p>FHD+, Super AMOLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>MediaTek Dimensity 6300</p></td><td  ><p>Exynos 1380</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>8GB</p></td><td  ><p>6GB/ 8GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB (expandable up to 1TB)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main with Quad Pixel technology, <br>8MP ultra-wide, macro vision lens, <br>32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 8MP ultra-wide,<br>2MP macro, <br>13MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers (Hi-Res Audio, Dolby Atmos)</p></td><td  ><p>Mono speaker</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,000mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td><td  ><p>No</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>5.4</p></td><td  ><p>5.3</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Water Resistance</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, IP69</p></td><td  ><p>IP67</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>166. 62 x 77.1 x 8.72 mm</p></td><td  ><p>164 x 77.5 x 7.7 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>208 grams</p></td><td  ><p>200 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>In the U.S., the Samsung Galaxy A26 officially comes in just one variant with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage for $299. However, you can find unlocked international variants on Amazon with 8GB RAM and 256GB storage for under $250. This makes the Galaxy much better value for money if you plan on picking up the global variant.</p><p>Most of the models sold in the U.S. and globally feature the Exynos 1380 SoC, which is more potent than the MediaTek chip in the Moto, at least on paper. I'm not sure to what extent the 6GB RAM variant would cripple performance, but ideally, get the one with more RAM if you can. Even though performance should be better than the Moto G Power, remember that this is still a budget offering, so limit your expectations accordingly.</p><p>Samsung has given the Galaxy A26 a 5,000mAh battery, which should give it solid one and a half to two days of runtime, just like the Moto. The maximum charging speed is 25W, which is a bit slower than what Motorola offers.</p><h2 id="moto-g-power-2026-vs-samsung-galaxy-a26-software-2">Moto G Power 2026 vs. Samsung Galaxy A26: Software</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4127px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4" name="moto-g-power-2026-evening-blue-hero" alt="The Motorola G Power 2026 in an evening blue color beside a coffee." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NWRTfeLt2Bo9sgFK4eyfJ4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4127" height="2321" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Moto G Power 2025 was promised two OS upgrades and three years of security updates, and we assume the same holds true for the 2026 model as well.

While there aren't really any homegrown AI features, you do get some of them from Google, like Circle to Search.</p><p>Samsung, on the other hand, offers six OS generation upgrades for the Galaxy A26, which is incredible and the highest we've seen for a phone at this price.

The two OS upgrade commitment is something that's hard to overlook, especially if you plan to use it for longer.

If you gloss over the mono speaker issue and the (still respectable) IP67 rating, the global variants are cheaper than the Moto, you get an AMOLED screen, a more premium glass design, and six OS upgrades, which is unheard of for a phone at this price.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="660c53b5-2c6f-4276-a78a-c730785b0d6f">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iRR4Df6yoThDfZqSUmFHph.jpg' alt="Moto G Power 2026"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Moto G Power 2026</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The toughest around</strong></em></p><p>The 2026 Moto G Power has the same toughness as the 2025 model but with a larger battery and a better selfie camera.

Reality Labs has been responsible for AR, VR, AI, and robotics development since its creation in 2020 and has historically spent billions on R&D each quarter.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html">Earlier reports</a> suggested that Meta was "trimming the fat" in the VR hardware research, OS development, and Horizon Worlds gaming social network development. However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/2011132640536002799?s=20">new information</a> suggests that the cuts are far deeper than we expected.</p><p>Meta is reportedly closing most of its first-party game development studios, including the houses responsible for respected VR games like Deadpool VR, Asgard's Wrath 2, Supernatural, and Resident Evil 4 VR. The studios rumored to be closing are Armature Studios, Sanzaru Games, Twisted Pixel, and Within. LinkedIn profiles confirm job cuts at all of these studios, but</p><p>Meta is said to be keeping Beat Games, BigBox VR, Camouflaj, and Ouro open. These studios are responsible for the development of Beat Saber, Population: One, Batman Arkham Shadow, and Horizon Worlds, respectively. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.uploadvr.com/meta-closes-twisted-pixel-armature-sanzaru-games/">UploadVR</a> says it has independently confirmed the studio closures.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2634px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.32%;"><img id="w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN" name="reality-labs-phoenix-mock-up-luna" alt="A mock-up of Reality Labs' Phoenix ultralight VR headset prototype made by Luna on X" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/w5menaReGjXp2KkbYQ5LaN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2634" height="1747" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @Lunayian on X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android Central has reached out to Meta for comment, but didn't receive a response in time for publishing. If true, this news would be a massive blow for the VR community and a huge hit to VR game development.</p><p>To date, Meta has closed several of its first-party studios over the years. We reported exclusively on the closing of Echo VR's studio back in August 2024, and Meta closed Unit 2 and Downpour Interactive in 2025. These cuts come after <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-reality-labs-budget-2026-quest-4">a 30% cut to the division</a> in early December 2025, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.roadtovr.com/quest-is-outselling-nintendo-switch-2-on-amazon-and-every-other-game-console/">outselling the Nintendo Switch 2 and other consoles on Amazon</a> during the Christmas holiday period.</p><p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth is expected to hold a company-wide in-person meeting on January 14, 2026, to discuss changes being made at Reality Labs. The company is believed to be shifting more resources to AI and smart glasses products in place of its historical commitment to VR development. We still expect Meta <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/new-meta-quest-4-rumors-lighter-headset-2025">to debut a new product</a> early in 2027 that's a hybrid of smart glasses and a traditional VR headset, currently known as Project Phoenix, pictured above in a mock-up.</p> ]]></dc:content>
