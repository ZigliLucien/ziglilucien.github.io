<hr>
<p>OnePlus already has a book-style foldable phone, but a new rumor says its next one might be a Galaxy Z Flip contender, and this one could even have a zoom lens, which is rare for foldable phones.</p><p>A leaker who goes by the handle Smart Pikachu on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/5888095979/O9GOwe7lS" target="_blank">Weibo</a> says that OnePlus might drop a second foldable phone this year. But it will supposedly be different from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-open-review">OnePlus Open</a> and will instead flip open like Motorola&apos;s Razr models and Samsung&apos;s Galaxy Z Flip line. The tipster adds that it will pack a telephoto and macro rear camera (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/oneplus-flip-foldable-leak-3434110/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>).</p><p>Foldables are seriously turning heads in the smartphone world these days, even though there aren&apos;t heaps to pick from just yet. It&apos;s no wonder every phone maker wants a piece of the action.</p><p>Flip phones fold in half for ultimate portability, unlike those giant slabs everyone else uses. Plus, they are usually more affordable than book-style foldables, putting them right up there with other <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">top Android phones</a> in terms of price.</p><p>But their cameras often leave something to be desired. Usually, they&apos;re rocking a dual-camera setup, but the telephoto lens is often the one that&apos;s missing. However, if this rumor about the OnePlus Flip is true, it could be a game-changer for flip phones by bringing a telephoto lens to the game.</p><p>The tipster is hinting that these camera upgrades will debut on OPPO&apos;s upcoming compact foldable, and it&apos;s likely they&apos;ll trickle down to a similar OnePlus model, maybe with a slight tweak or rebranding.</p><p>Even though it&apos;s not official yet, it&apos;s not exactly a wild guess. The OnePlus Open was basically a twin of the OPPO Find N3. If OnePlus rolls out a flip phone resembling the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n3-flip-review">Find N3 Flip</a>, it wouldn&apos;t be a shocker.</p><p>Plus, having a flip phone with a telephoto camera would be pretty unique since hardly any flip foldables offer this feature right now. In fact, the only one you can actually buy right now with a telephoto camera is the Find N3 Flip. So, if this rumor is accurate, the OnePlus Flip could be a real standout.</p>

The term "Google Pay" still exists for making contactless NFC payments in stores, but you use the Google Wallet app for those transactions.</p><p>Now that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-pay-changes-june-shutdown-announced">Google Pay app is shutting down</a> later this year, you&apos;re probably curious which Pay features will transfer over to Wallet. You may also have heard that Google Wallet supports features like driver&apos;s licenses, tickets, and medical info, and you may want to know how to access these.</p><p>Our in-depth Google Wallet guide will break down its history, list of key features, recent news and updates, and everything else you need to know!</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-summarized"><span>Google Wallet, summarized</span></h2>
<p>The original Google Wallet launched in 2011 as a Nexus phone exclusive for contactless credit card payments at specific locations. A lack of NFC-enabled phones, insufficient retail partnerships, and little consumer interest sunk the initiative.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-rolling-out-starting-today">Android Pay</a> took Wallet&apos;s place in 2015 as a payment system with much more business support and infrastructure, while Wallet scaled down into a peer-to-peer payment system. </p><p>By 2018, both services had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-pay-and-google-wallet-join-together-form-google-pay">consolidated</a> into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-pay">Google Pay</a> brand, a single app for both tap-to-pay and sending money to friends, and Google Wallet ceased to be. Over time, Google Pay added boarding passes, event confirmations, transit balances, and other tools that weren&apos;t strictly "payments."</p><p>Google&apos;s love of renaming services for a marketing boost came full circle in July 2022, when it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-launch">rebranded its payment service to Google Wallet</a> once again. Google Pay persisted as a peer-to-peer payment app with its wallet-like features removed, but it will shut down on June 4, 2024.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN" name="Google-Wallet-screenshot-3.jpeg" alt="Google Wallet example animation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kqEepFZJn662Vo6h4xJVVN.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet will continue to support "Google Pay" payments in stores worldwide. It <strong>won&apos;t</strong> enable P2P payments like the original Pay app, however, and your current Google Pay balance will only be transferrable through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://pay.google.com/pay/u/0/home" target="_blank">website</a> once the Pay mobile app shuts down.</p><p>Google Wallet supports a variety of banks and credit cards across over 80 countries. It also supports a variety of other passes, IDs, and stored information that we&apos;ll break down in the next section.</p><p>Generally speaking, Google Wallet pulls information from other Google apps on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>. So, for example, if you receive an email on Gmail with a delayed flight time, it&apos;ll notify you and change the stored boarding pass information.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-can-you-store-in-google-wallet"><span>What can you store in Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2171px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg" name="Google-Wallet-app-examples.jpg" alt="Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GcryGVh4qBqev2QRstYGgg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2171" height="1221" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>First and foremost, you can deposit <strong>credit</strong> and <strong>debit cards</strong> in Google Wallet. Most banks and cards are compatible, and Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/the-google-wallet-push-continues-as-30-new-banks-are-added-in-the-us">has added</a> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-supports-42-additional-banks">dozens of new banks</a> in 2024 to fill out the list before Google Pay&apos;s shutdown. You can ensure your bank is included by checking the list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/pay/answer/7454247?hl=en&ref_topic=7625138" target="_blank">supported contactless payments</a> sorted by country.</p><p>As a sidenote, we have a guide on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-lock-down-google-wallet-cards">how to lock down your Google Wallet cards</a> if your phone is stolen, so that the thief can&apos;t use tap-to-pay with those stored cards.</p><p>You can add your <strong>loyalty </strong>or <strong>membership cards</strong>, then tap your phone or watch to apply discounts or balances, or even pay directly for items. Check if your loyalty card is eligible by tapping <strong>Add to Wallet > Loyalty card </strong>and entering the program name.</p><p>Plus, you can keep your <strong>boarding passes</strong> and <strong>event tickets</strong> in Google Wallet, so entering a plane or stadium is as simple as pulling them up and tapping your phone. In March 2024, Google updated Wallet so that Gmail confirmation emails <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-gains-movie-boarding-pass-support-from-gmail">automatically export passes to Wallet</a>, saving you the trouble.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC" name="Google-Wallet-Add-Transit-Card.jpeg" alt="Adding public transit card to Google Wallet" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ePCQ8DDxq2B53qYgv6ZSyC.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Google Wallet also hosts <strong>transit cards</strong> and <strong>parking passes</strong>, though once again, there is no guarantee that your local public transit or parking system will support Google Wallet without checking. Currently, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and Toronto are the only cities to support Google Wallet transit passes or payments.</p><p>You may add <strong>COVID-19 vaccine passports</strong> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-covid-vaccine-cards-google-wallet">other medical info</a> to Google Wallet as well.</p><p>Other Google Wallet functions include <strong>digital car keys</strong>, <strong>corporate office passes</strong>, and <strong>hotel keys</strong>. Digital car keys require a relatively recent phone running Android 12 or later, and not all cars will support them. As for corporate badges, only <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/14085932?hl=en&ref_topic=11925097&sjid=11940236237620777137-NA" target="_blank">10 countries</a> support corporate passes today, and your employer must buy into the program.</p><p>Google&apos;s biggest challenge, however, will be to enable <strong>digital driver&apos;s licenses</strong> or <strong>student IDs</strong>. Certain American states have begun to support digital IDs, but it&apos;s extremely limited at the moment.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-can-i-store-my-driver-s-license-in-google-wallet"><span>Can I store my driver's license in Google Wallet?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZVy8MWzXVKBSjhv5khk5Ph" name="Google-IO-2022-digital-driver's-license-graphic.png" alt="Digital Driver's license graphic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZVy8MWzXVKBSjhv5khk5Ph.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>During Google I/O 2022, VP of Product Management Sameer Samat announced on stage that "we&apos;re working with states here in the U.S. and governments around the world to bring digital IDs to wallet later this year, starting with driver&apos;s licenses."</p><p>That statement turned out to be a bit optimistic: The ID program did launch in Maryland by the end of 2022, but Google took until October 2023 to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-digital-ids-for-three-more-us-states">add digital ID support for Arizona, Colorado, and Georgia residents</a>.</p><p>Dong Min Kim, Google&apos;s director of product management for Google Wallet, did <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-to-expand-digital-drivers-license-support">promise in January</a> that "Digital ID will be a cornerstone for us in the next year" and that more states&apos; IDs will come to Wallet in the coming months. But we&apos;ve yet to hear anything since, and there are regulatory hurdles to making this happen.</p><p>To add a driver&apos;s license to Google Wallet, you&apos;ll need an Android phone (version 8 or higher) with Bluetooth and Nearby Devices active and a screen lock protecting it.</p><p>With all of those prerequisites fulfilled, you can simply open the Wallet app and tap <strong>Add to Wallet > ID card</strong>. You&apos;ll then have to take photos of the front and back of your ID, then record a short video of yourself to submit for verification. At that point, you should be able to use your ID in lieu of a physical card at participating airports.</p><p>As for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-add-student-id-google-wallet">adding a student ID to Google Wallet</a>, we have a guide for that as well, but it will once again depend on whether or not your school supports the feature.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-google-wallet-banks"><span>Google Wallet: Banks</span></h2>
<p>We can&apos;t possibly include the full list of Google Wallet banks here, so we&apos;ll link you to this <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wallet/answer/12059326?hl=en&co=GENIE.CountryCode%3DUS&sjid=13323444051548168082-NA" target="_blank"><strong>Google Support page</strong></a><strong> </strong>that has a dropdown menu linking to each country&apos;s list of banks.</p><p>Just for the United States alone, the list of "other participating banks" appears to have <strong>thousands of options</strong>. Once you&apos;ve selected a bank in Google Wallet, you&apos;ll most likely need to log into the bank&apos;s website, or enter a PIN or authorization code.</p><p>You can also choose to make Paypal a payment method in Google Wallet, though only in the United States and Germany.</p>

<p>Android users, specifically Samsung phone owners, have two main choices for their payment app: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-vs-google-wallet">Google Wallet or Samsung Wallet</a>. The latter launched around the same time as Google Wallet, combining Samsung Pay and Samsung Pass into one service. Sound familiar?</p><p>Like Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet collects your digital payment cards, boarding passes, vaccination cards, and digital car keys, with the eventual goal of adding IDs and licenses.</p><p><em>Unlike</em> Google Wallet, Samsung Wallet stores passwords, a remnant of the feature on Samsung Pass. Plus, anyone invested in crypto can "monitor their digital asset portfolio by checking the value of their cryptocurrencies across various exchanges" within Wallet.</p><p>Samsung Wallet is available now, but only on Samsung phones via the Galaxy Store — whereas Google Wallet is available on all Android phones via the Play Store — and only 21 countries, well short of Google&apos;s list.</p><p>Looking beyond the Android phone ecosystem, we also have a general guide on how the five main payment systems — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta-pay-vs-amazon-pay-vs-google-pay-vs-samsung-pay">Google Pay, Samsung Pay, Apple Pay, Meta Pay, and Amazon Pay</a> — compare to one another. </p><p>To briefly summarize, Google and Apple have the most robust features and widespread presence for both mobile and web payments. Amazon Pay is more limited but takes very little setup if you have a Prime account, while Meta Pay is most useful for frequent Facebook Marketplace users.</p>

<p>The biggest recent change to Google Wallet was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-qr-barcode-pass-rollout">photo function</a>, which lets you take a photo of a physical pass and have that data auto-transcribed into Wallet, rather than making you type it out yourself.</p><p>Google Wallet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-apple-pass-more-user-support">added support for Apple Wallet files</a> in early 2024, though the rollout is still ongoing. People have noticed glitches, since ".pkpass" file expect you to be using an iPhone, but those glitches should be fixed over time.</p><p>Another controversy arose when Google Wallet began <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-verification-change">requiring you to verify your identity</a> before making contactless payments in certain countries. While some countries already required this, others let you make payments indefinitely so long as they weren&apos;t above a certain threshold.</p><p>Google later created <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-adds-verification-settings-to-balance-security-and-convenience">"Verification Settings"</a> for Wallet, letting you decide in advance whether to require authentication before certain actions, such as using Wallet as a transit pass.</p><p>In late 2023, there was a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-wallet-vulnerability-exposes-card-information">Google Wallet vulnerability</a> that exposed credit card information via a standard NFC reader. This glitch was eventually fixed.</p>

<p>The list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-watches-support-android-pay">smartwatches that support Google Pay</a> is exceedingly long. Basically, any Wear OS watch is going to support the feature, since it&apos;s a Google operating system.

Sometimes, internet connection can be spotty or fail altogether, and saving them for offline viewing will give you a library of content to pass the time.</p><p>Whether you&apos;re watching videos on one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-tablets">best Samsung tablets</a> or not, downloading YouTube videos is quick and easy. Even though <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/streaming-platforms-prioritize-content-over-ui">streaming services aren&apos;t getting better</a>, they still want you to pay for more content. But finding something to watch when your internet isn&apos;t working can be frustrating, so it&apos;s always a good idea to have a backup plan and videos to watch.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> To download YouTube videos, you must have a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-premium">YouTube Premium</a> subscription.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-download-youtube-videos-to-watch-offline-2">How to download YouTube videos to watch offline</h2>
<p>1. Open the <strong>YouTube app </strong>on your device.</p><p>2. Find and <strong>open the video</strong> you want to download.</p><p>3. Tap <strong>Download </strong>in the menu that appears below the video.</p><p>4. If you don&apos;t have YouTube Premium, you&apos;ll see a <strong>prompt to get it</strong>, which is required to download videos. You can start the free trial or select<strong> Not now </strong>if you don&apos;t wish to proceed. If you give the Premium version a chance, you&apos;ll see a Subscribe button with information letting you know the day the free trial ends and how much you&apos;ll be charged after. YouTube will remind you that your free trial is ending seven days before the deadline.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8" name="download youtube videos 1-3.jpg" alt="youtube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/86KjjzLv8Q3eisWVbJjuu8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>5. If you have YouTube Premium, you’ll be given <strong>options for the resolution to download the video</strong>. Naturally, the higher the resolution, the more space the download will take up on your device and the potentially longer the video will take to download (though with good Wi-Fi or a solid cellular connection, this likely won’t be an issue). Choose the desired resolution and select <strong>Download</strong>.</p><p>6. Once selected, the <strong>video will automatically begin downloading,</strong> and you’ll see the download process as the arrow lights up.</p><p>7. Once downloaded, the download button will show <strong>Downloaded</strong> with a white checkmark beside it.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ju4bAk2ZJCyxK9d6nyhJ69" name="download youtube videos 4-6.jpg" alt="youtube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ju4bAk2ZJCyxK9d6nyhJ69.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="800" height="450" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Christine Persaud / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As noted, to download YouTube videos for offline viewing, like the top trending videos to watch during your commutes or a walk down memory lane with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-2023-recap">YouTube Music 2023</a>, you need a YouTube Premium subscription, which is $13.99 a month. However, you can try it out for one month for free before committing.</p><p>Once downloaded, you have up to 29 days to watch the downloaded video. If you haven’t gotten around to watching yet after the timeframe expires, you can reconnect to a mobile or Wi-Fi network and download the video again (if it’s still available for offline viewing). If it is no longer available, it will automatically be removed from your device the next time you sync it. If any changes have been made to the video, they will be applied when you&apos;re online.</p><p>Once a YouTube video is downloaded, it resides locally on your device. That means it’s taking up valuable space, so it’s a good idea to delete it once you are done watching and no longer need it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-delete-downloaded-youtube-videos-2">How to delete downloaded YouTube videos</h2>
<p>Deleting the video is simple:</p><p>1. Tap your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Swipe up and choose <strong>Downloads</strong>.</p><p>3. Tap the <strong>dots to the side</strong> of the video.</p><p>4. Tap <strong>Delete</strong> from downloads at the bottom.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-smart-downloads-on-youtube-2">What are Smart Downloads on YouTube?</h2>
<p>Smart Downloads are recommended videos that YouTube automatically downloads so you always have something to watch. The downloads will stop when you&apos;re low on storage or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.androidcentral.com/threads/wifi-keeps-disconnecting-and-reconnecting.1064087/">disconnected from Wi-Fi</a>. Based on your viewing habits, YouTube will automatically download videos you might like.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-youtube-smart-downloads-work-2">How does YouTube Smart Downloads work?</h2>
<p>If the videos are not downloading, you can enable the feature by:</p><p>1. Tapping your <strong>profile picture</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap the <strong>cogwheel</strong> at the top right.</p><p>3. Go to <strong>Backgrounds & downloads</strong>.</p><p>4. Look for and <strong>toggle on</strong> the <strong>Smart downloads</strong> option.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:74.07%;"><img id="TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU" name="Turn-off-smart-download-YouTube.jpg" alt="Steps to turn on or off Smart Downloads on YouTube" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TLRLvy4DHhN7jyBnGcgHvU.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="3240" height="2400" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Judy Sanhz / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>As long as you&apos;re here, you can also make other adjustments, such as only downloading over Wi-Fi, adjusting how Playback works, and adjusting how much storage Smart downloads takes up and the quality of Smart downloads. You&apos;ll also see options for Delete all downloads and how much storage you have left. When you adjust the storage space the feature takes up by using the slider; you&apos;ll also see how much video time that is. For example, you set the storage limit to 1.5GB, and besides it, you&apos;ll see that that equals 11 hours of videos.</p>
<h2 id="keep-downloading-2">Keep downloading</h2>
<p>It&apos;s easy to take the Internet for granted and think it&apos;ll always be there, but it&apos;s best to be prepared and have some YouTube videos to watch. If you&apos;re going to watch YouTube on your computer, get ready for a change since YouTube is testing a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-might-change-the-location-of-video-titles-and-comments">redesigned video player on the web</a>.</p><p>Since YouTube Music is also part of the package, remember that it&apos;s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-music-for-android-and-ios-gain-activity-feed">rolling out a new Activity feed for Android and iOS</a>.

If you&apos;re just looking for a basic smartphone with some surprising flagship-level features, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/google-pixel-7a-5g-128gb-unlocked-charcoal/6539915.p"><strong>Best Buy is shaving up to $250 OFF the Google Pixel 7a</strong></a>, a midrange device that features 128GB of storage for the base model, the efficiency of the Tensor G2 chipset, and excellent cameras with 4K video recording. The $250 discount is applied when you activate the phone through a carrier on Best Buy&apos;s site, but you can also score a $150 discount when you buy unlocked. That&apos;s the biggest straight discount that the phone has ever received. </p><p>Along with its good-looking 6.1-inch AMOLED display and its great cameras, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7a-review">Google Pixel 7a</a> comes with five years of Pixel updates, and it includes many of the same useful features as last year&apos;s more-expensive Pixel 7 Pro. </p>

For a limited time, you can get a straight $150 off the unlocked Google Pixel 7a at Best Buy, representing 30% off the normal price. Alternatively, you can activate the phone through a carrier and get $250 off, which amounts to a 50% discount! </p>
<p>This simple smartphone includes a bright 6.1-inch AMOLED display, a slick chipset, and capable cameras for both photos and video. Plus, get five years of Android OS updates at an even cheaper price than this phone normal comes with.</p>

<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you&apos;re looking for a phone with an especially bright, vibrant display of around 6.1 inches; you want an affordable smartphone that still has a good camera for photo and video; you prioritize a phone with several years of OS updates.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> you&apos;re looking for a smartphone with great battery life; you plan to use your phone for gaming and don&apos;t mind paying extra for top-notch performance; you don&apos;t like a phone with a plastic exterior.</p><p>With the release of the Pixel 8a likely just around the corner, the Pixel 7a is no longer groundbreaking, but it has all the basic features that Pixel fans are looking for, and this deal makes the already affordable phone even cheaper. With a 6.1-inch AMOLED display and powerful cameras with 4K video recording, it&apos;s not hard to appreciate this phone&apos;s offerings—especially at this extra low price.</p><p>Some of the downsides of this phone include its basic plastic structural design, the lack of a telephoto lens, and some pretty subpar battery life. Still, it remains a great <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phone</a>, and for those looking for a deal on something reliable, this is honestly a pretty great pick at this price — <em>especially </em>if you decide to activate today.</p>

It's always best to have more storage space than you think you might need just in case your needs change and you're not stuck with a tablet you can't even update due to lack of storage space.</p></article></section>
<h2 id="which-fire-tablet-storage-size-should-you-buy-2">Which Fire Tablet storage size should you buy?</h2>
<p>The first thing you need to know about buying an Amazon Fire tablet (or any modern mobile gadget, for that matter!) is that the listed (or advertised) storage capacity is different from the usable storage space you&apos;ll end up with. Amazon&apos;s tablets use a Fire OS layered on top of the Android operating system, which requires a decent chunk of storage for core system functions and all of Amazon&apos;s apps and services that come preinstalled on these devices.</p><p>Now, you can look at your options, especially when considering a tablet that offers 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB storage sizes. That low-end 16GB tablet will only give you about 12GB of usable storage. Depending on your plans for downloading games, movies, and other media, you&apos;ll want as much storage as possible.</p>
<p>The Fire HD 10 tablet comes in 32GB and 64GB variants, so spending a little extra to double the storage size is a no-brainer. It&apos;s also worth pointing out that Amazon recently updated its line of kid-friendly Amazon Fire devices. While the previous 16GB Fire 7 Kids Edition may have offered enough storage for your tiny tech wizard, Amazon now offers the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-fire-hd-10-kids-vs-kids-pro" target="_blank">Fire HD 10 Kids and Fire HD 10 Kids Pro</a> tablets, both of which double the storage space to 32GB.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="ok7osy6uGAKYpCWdVURe3G" name="amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-on-table.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 8 (2022) laying face down on table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ok7osy6uGAKYpCWdVURe3G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Things get trickier (and pricier) when you consider the newer Fire HD tablets. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-8-2022-review" target="_blank">Fire HD 8</a> model, which is still our pick for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet" target="_blank">best Amazon Fire Tablet</a> on the market right now, is available in 32GB and 64GB options, as are the Fire HD 8 Plus, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-hd-10-2023-launch">Fire HD 10</a>, and Fire HD 10 Plus. The 32GB size is quite a reasonable choice here, and depending on how you plan to use the tablet and the prevalence of media streaming services these days, you might not even need to opt for the 64GB variant.</p>
<p>Then there&apos;s the recently launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/amazon-fire-max-11-review" target="_blank">Fire Max 11</a>, which comes in 64GB and 128GB storage sizes, the latter being the largest storage size ever offered in a Fire tablet. Apart from the usual things like media consumption, the Fire Max 11 is also intended for productivity-centric workflows. Even then, the 64GB option will be more than sufficient for basic needs.</p>
<h2 id="expand-your-fire-tablet-apos-s-storage-with-a-microsd-card-2">Expand your Fire Tablet&apos;s storage with a microSD card</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4u4mvimzVmhokVAsQbZGFj" name="Amazon-Fire-HD-10-2021-lifestyle-16x9-01.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4u4mvimzVmhokVAsQbZGFj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to storage space, the price tends to increase with the capacity. However, if you opt for a device with less storage to save, don&apos;t worry—thanks to the versatile microSD slot, you always have the option to increase in size with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-micro-sd-card-android">decent memory card</a>. Thanks to the extra space, you can modify your device&apos;s storage to fit your needs.</p><p>A microSD slot is a reliable feature that you&apos;ve always seen on the Fire tablets and still do in the newer models. With this slot, you can expand the capacity as much as you need. The slot can be a real lifesaver when you unexpectedly need extra storage space.</p><p>When it comes to great deals on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-microsd-cards-amazon-fire-tablet">microSD cards for Fire Tablets</a>, we&apos;ve got you covered with these great options. You can choose from options as little as 64GB or as much as 1TB. If you&apos;re an average user and want to have enough space, you can always go with the 256GB version. They usually go for about $25, but you never know when one of them might be on sale.</p>

<p>Before plunging into the details, here are a couple of facts about Amazon that&apos;ll help you understand the company&apos;s outlook on sustainability. A few years ago, the e-commerce goliath joined other popular brands like Microsoft, Best Buy, and Verizon in signing the Climate Pledge. In line with the aims of the non-profit organization, Amazon aims to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by the year 2040. Billions of dollars worth of investments have already gone into this initiative, giving birth to projects like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-promoting-eco-friendly-shopping-its-new-climate-pledge-friendly-program">Climate Pledge Friendly program</a>, green operations and logistics decisions, and the use of renewable energy across many Amazon buildings and warehouses.</p><p>There&apos;s the Amazon Aware store that sells various household and lifestyle products that have been certified by third parties for their use of organic, recycled, and bio-based materials. For sellers, entities like Amazon Launchpad exist to help them implement sustainability across their brands.</p><p>If you own one of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-alexa-speaker">best Alexa-enabled speakers</a> and live in the U.S., Amazon has made it even more accessible to contribute to an eco-friendly cause. All you need to do is say <strong>"Alexa, grow a tree”</strong> and you can donate a dollar towards the One Tree Planted initiative. All your contributions are used to plant trees, converting every $1 into one tree planted on your behalf, combatting climate change and pollution one tree at a time.</p><p>Clearly, Amazon is committed to offsetting the negative environmental impacts of its business operations. The tech giant has taken many steps towards achieving a more sustainable existence and enables you, the consumer, to also participate in the same cause. Now, let&apos;s look at the many options available to you to shop more sustainably on Amazon.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-climate-pledge-friendly"><span>Climate Pledge Friendly</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1437px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="etZLzcWyrm6VLAAHG5azuG" name="amazon-climate-friendly-pledge.jpg" alt="Amazon Climate Pledge Friendly" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/etZLzcWyrm6VLAAHG5azuG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1437" height="809" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is one of the first things to do when shopping in a more sustainable way on Amazon. All you have to do is look for the little green <strong>Climate Pledge Friendly</strong> badge under the product listing. No matter what you&apos;re buying, if it has been certified as environmentally friendly under The Climate Pledge requirements, Amazon will print that little green logo under the item&apos;s name.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>amazon.com/climatepledgefriendly</strong>.</p><p>2. Search for the product of your choice. You can also use the Climage Pledge Friendly filter on the left to narrow down the results.</p><p>3. Look for a listing with the <strong>green Climate Pledge Friendly badge </strong>or that lists a sustainability feature (or more than one). If you tap on <strong>sustainability feature,</strong> you&apos;ll see a pop-up on the right side that outlines what they are. It could be that the item was made with a certain percentage of recycled materials or that it is Certified Climate neutral by a third-party organization.</p>

<p>If you&apos;re the sort of person who doesn&apos;t want to purchase used or refurbished products, there is another option. Shopping sustainably on Amazon doesn&apos;t always lead to preloved or renewed items. Under the <strong>Amazon Trade-in</strong> program, you can trade-in your own used electronics for Amazon gift cards and/or promotional discounts. The Amazon Trade-in procedure varies depending on what it is that you want to trade-in.</p><p>After you have selected your device under the Amazon Trade-in section on the Amazon website, you&apos;ll have to answer some questions about it to confirm its condition and value. The answers to your questions determine the value you will get and how fast you will get it. For instance, certain items qualify for instant payment, while others may not yield you any monetary gain until you&apos;ve sent them in for appraisal.</p><p>What&apos;s really great is that shipping your used electronic gadgets to Amazon doesn&apos;t cost you anything. Even if the item is worth nothing, Amazon will ship it back to you free of charge. All you have to do is print the shipping label and send it in. Here&apos;s how you can initiate the Amazon Trade-in process.</p>
<p>1. Go to <strong>amazon.com/tradein</strong>.</p><p>2. Select the device category that matches your item.</p><p>3. Read and <strong>follow the Amazon Trade-in instructions</strong> for your specific device.</p>

<p>Nothing appears serious in making its Phone 2a have a smoother and bug-free experience.

<hr>
<p>We got our first decent look at the upcoming<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render"> Razr Plus 2024</a> smartphone via a leaked render early this year. Alongside the render, the leak also hinted at a model number for the forthcoming handset. New certification with a similar model number bearing handset hints that the launch is imminent.</p><p>New information from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2024/04/14/motorola-razr-plus-2024-radio-certification-china/">Gizmochina</a>, however, hints that the <strong>XT2453-2</strong> — believed to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024">Razr Plus 2024</a> has passed Radio Certification in China. While the certification doesn&apos;t mention any specs of the device, it is worth noting that the launch of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">foldable phone</a> is approaching.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="aiZv6GkpSYfRaxvJ7YTny9" name="Motorola-Razr-Plus-2024-Certification.jpg" alt="Razr Plus 2024 radio certification" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aiZv6GkpSYfRaxvJ7YTny9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Gizmochina)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The model number from the previous leak was <strong>XT2453-3</strong>, which is presumably tailored to the U.S. region and was further codenamed "Glory." </p><p>Until now, little is known about the device except for the aforementioned render and the model number. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-razr-plus-2024-alleged-leaked-render">The leak</a>, as mentioned, also showcased the first possible render of the Razr Plus 2024 model. The clamshell phone sports more rounded edges than the current iteration, and the phone also appears a tad bit wider, per the image from the leak.</p><p>We will likely see a similar cover display that wraps around the device&apos;s dual primary cameras and LED flash, unlike Samsung&apos;s approach, which cuts the display around the cameras as in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5-review">Galaxy Z Flip 5</a>. </p>

<p>The Razr Plus 2024 model is rumored to see significant internal changes rather than the physical appearance of the predecessor model, which already saw a drastic change from its previous iteration.</p><p>The upcoming clamshell phone is expected to be powered by Qualcomm&apos;s latest and greatest Snapdragon chipset, although the precise one is yet to be determined. Subpar battery life and passable cameras were significant setbacks to the current Razr Plus model, which will likely be addressed in the successor this year. </p><p>As for the takeoff, Motorola has yet to reveal the launch date of the Razr Plus 2024, and with the latest radio certification, the launch date could be sooner rather than later.</p>

<hr>
<p>Motorola is big on smartphones, but it also offers a bunch of accessories like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-earbuds">wireless earbuds</a>, and the company announced today (April 16), its latest earbuds lineup.</p><p>A few days ago, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1778277983582634255" target="_blank">rumors were buzzing</a> about the Moto Buds and Moto Buds Plus. Now, they&apos;re official with Hi-Res Audio, top-notch noise control, and a triple-mic setup. Plus, they&apos;re rocking a water-repellent design, although Motorola is keeping us in the dark about the official IP rating.</p><p>The Plus model is coming in Forest Grey and Beach Sand. Meanwhile, the regular version is dropping in four colors: Starlight Blue, Glacier Blue, Coral Peach, and Kiwi Green.</p><p>Motorola teamed up with Bose to tweak the Moto Buds Plus. That means you&apos;re getting some serious active noise cancellation and EQ tuning, thanks to the integration of <em>Sound by Bose</em>.</p><p>Another standout feature is Motorola&apos;s CrystalTalk AI, which features an anti-wind noise algorithm so that even in noisy places, your voice comes through crystal clear.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1333px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="Wy8R7q6ukyzW5p8XWH6xmA" name="Moto-Buds-Plus-grey.png" alt="Moto Buds Plus in grey" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Wy8R7q6ukyzW5p8XWH6xmA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1333" height="750" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Under the hood, the Moto Buds Plus include dual dynamic drivers and promising studio-quality music thanks to Hi-Res Audio. It captures sound in a wider range with three times more detail, especially on Hi-Res Audio streaming apps.</p><p>The Moto Buds Plus also works with Dolby Head Tracking when hooked up to the latest Motorola Edge smartphones rocking Dolby Atmos tech, like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-ultra-launch">Motorola Edge 50 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola-edge-50-pro-announced-in-india">Edge 50 Pro</a>. With Dolby Head Tracking, your sound adjusts as you move your head, giving you a natural listening experience.</p><p>In terms of battery life, the Moto Buds Plus promises up to eight hours of playtime on just one charge. And if you&apos;re in a rush, just 10 minutes of charging gives you an extra three hours of listening time. Plus, with their charging case, these buds can last up to 38 hours.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the regular Moto Buds come with a 12.4mm dynamic driver, guaranteeing you some sharp, clean audio.</p><p>Just like its higher-end siblings, the regular Moto Buds also come equipped with CrystalTalk AI. But these buds outlast the Moto Buds Plus. With up to nine hours of playtime on one charge and an extra two hours squeezed out of just 10 minutes of charging, they&apos;re ready for the long haul.</p><p>The Moto Buds models have a dedicated app to control them. You can use it to adjust how much noise cancellation you want or turn it off completely. Even better, the app can automatically adjust the noise cancellation depending on how noisy things are around you. And if you need to hear what&apos;s happening around you, you can turn on <em>Transparency Mode</em> so you don&apos;t miss anything.</p><p>Motorola is selling the Moto Buds Plus in selected markets across Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania starting today for $130. That said, the Forest Grey version will be exclusive to North America. Meanwhile, the regular model will go on sale in the coming weeks at a base price of €59, or approximately $68.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-transfer-the-oneplus-watch-2-to-a-new-phone-2">How to transfer the OnePlus Watch 2 to a new phone</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, the OnePlus Watch 2 doesn&apos;t transfer over as easily, despite running Wear OS 4. We&apos;ve confirmed with OnePlus that you need to "disconnect and reset" your smartwatch before pairing with a new phone:</p><p>1. In the OHealth app, tap the <strong>Device</strong> tab, then scroll down to select <strong>More</strong>.</p><p>2. Tap <strong>Unpair</strong>, then tap <strong>Unpair</strong> again. Your OnePlus Watch 2 will automatically factory reset itself, so you can sync it to your new phone.</p><p>That said, you <em>can</em> transfer over your health data before the reset, by installing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heytap.health.international&hl=en_US&gl=US" target="_blank"><strong>OHealth app</strong></a> on your new phone:</p><p>1. Sign into the same OHealth account on both phones.</p><p>2. Make sure both phones are on the <strong>same Wi-Fi network</strong>.</p><p>3. On both phones, tap the <strong>profile icon</strong> in the app&apos;s top-right, then tap <strong>Migrate</strong>.</p><p>4. Tap either <strong>new phone</strong> or <strong>old phone</strong> on each phone, then <strong>scan the QR code</strong>.</p><p>5. Select which data you want to migrate. All data is selected by default.</p>
<h2 id="figuring-out-wear-os-and-propriety-skins-2">Figuring out Wear OS and propriety skins</h2>
<p>We didn&apos;t cover every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wear-os-watch">Wear OS watch</a> here, because most of the older Wear OS 3 watches use their own proprietary systems and require you to reset the watch first. We&apos;re happy that Google finally prioritized simple transfers, for people who frequently swap between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-cheap-android-phones">cheap Android phones</a> but want to make their smartwatch last across devices.</p><p>It&apos;s no coincidence, though, that the two <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">best Android watches</a> are the two that made this transfer system work. Google and Samsung frequently develop the latest smartwatch tech for themselves, leaving other brands playing catch-up. So if you&apos;re looking for a smartwatch built to last, you&apos;ll probably want to consider a Galaxy or Pixel Watch first.</p>

<p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 came out in mid-2023, but because it'll receive four years of software support, it's meant to last through 2027 (at least). That means it'll be ready to transfer from one Android phone to the next, offering long battery life and a bright, thin-edged AMOLED display.</p></p>
