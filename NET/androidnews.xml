<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-2">What you need to know</h2>
<ul><li>The Android System Key Verifier, launched with last week’s Play System update, helps developers store encryption keys for extra chat protection.</li><li>It uses encryption keys and QR codes to verify identities, and works on devices with Android 10 or newer.</li><li>If someone switches devices, the keys won’t match, signaling a potential identity check or a new device.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's latest app on the Play Store wants to lock down your chats and keep Android devices safe from cyber threats like scams and hacks.</p><p>Mishaal Rahman at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/android-system-key-verifier-3499353/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> reports that the Android System Key Verifier app just rolled out with last week’s Google Play System update. The app lets developers securely store end-to-end encryption keys, adding extra protection to user chats.</p><p>The app uses encryption keys and QR codes to verify user identities and works as a system service on any device running Android 10 or later.</p>

<p>As per Rahman, the app probably taps into the Contact Keys feature, similar to Contact Key Verification on iOS. Basically, it’ll give you a heads-up in Apple Messages if an unfamiliar device connects to one of your contacts.</p><p>At the moment, no apps can use the Key Verifier, but the Play Store <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.contactkeys&pcampaignid=web_share" target="_blank">listing</a> gives a look at how it works. The app operates in two main steps. First, it stores encryption keys for messaging apps like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/top-5-tips-and-tricks-google-messages">Google Messages</a>, ensuring conversations stay protected with end-to-end encryption.</p><p>Second, it lets users confirm contacts by exchanging QR codes. When adding a new contact, both people can scan each other's QR codes to verify they’re chatting with the right person.</p><p>Down the line, if a different device is used, the keys won’t line up. This could mean the person you're talking to isn’t actually who they say they are—or they might just be on a new device, which would need a quick QR code scan to confirm.</p><p>Right now, the Android System Key Verifier’s on its own, but it looks like Google might mix it into Messages next year. Google started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-now-has-smarter-detection-to-tackle-tricky-scam-messages">working on a contact verification feature for Messages last month</a>, set for a 2025 release. So, it’s likely that the Key Verifier app is a step toward that integration.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-12">OnePlus 12</a> is an unquestionable hit, with OnePlus nailing the design, hardware, and cameras this year. The phone continues to hold its own against costlier rivals, and honestly, if you don&apos;t need seven years of software updates that are guaranteed by Google and Samsung, it is a fantastic choice.</p><p>But the introduction of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> comes with the inevitable quandary: buy the OnePlus 12 while it&apos;s discounted now, or wait a few months and get the OnePlus 13? The OnePlus 13 is even faster, has new camera tech, and comes with a massive battery that should last longer.</p><p>I used the OnePlus 12 extensively, and while I didn&apos;t get to test the OnePlus 13 just yet, let&apos;s take a look at what you get with the new device, and whether you should wait until it goes on sale or buy the OnePlus 12 right now.</p>
<h2 id="you-get-the-latest-internals-2">You get the latest internals</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR" name="Snapdragon-8-Elite-Gaming" alt="A photo showing a gaming phone with the Snapdragon 8 Elite logo hovering above it" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rRUXiFcY6iXrsZAHShZKPR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1468" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Like most other 2025 Android phones, the OnePlus 13 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Obviously, there&apos;s a lot of excitement in the latest Qualcomm platform given the sizeable upgrades — including the custom cores — and it will be interesting to see how these hold up in daily use.</p><p>The OnePlus 12 is no slouch in this regard, but the OnePlus 13 should deliver meaningful gains. That said, it remains to be seen if you&apos;ll actually be able to use the hardware to its potential; OxygenOS throttles most games to 60fps, so even if the hardware theoretically allows 120fps gaming, the software needs additional tweaks.</p><p>Although the rest of the hardware is relatively unchanged, you get other niceties, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69 dust and water resistance</a>. While IP68 is still great, the new standard safeguards against water jets in addition to submersion, making the device that much more resilient. </p>
<h2 id="it-should-take-even-better-photos-2">It should take even better photos</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW" name="OnePlus-13" alt="OnePlus 13 back camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/quDzk7qjpypqXDWpK2ThqW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus / Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 uses the same 50MP f/1.6 main camera as last year, and that&apos;s not a bad thing at all. The sensor is clearly among the best around, and we should get better photos and videos with improved tuning.</p><p>What I&apos;m excited about is the auxiliary cameras; the OnePlus 13 has 50MP wide-angle and telephoto cameras, and they&apos;re the same as the ones on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppos-answer-to-the-galaxy-s25-is-launching-globally-on-november-21">Find X8 Pro</a>. That should give the device a considerable edge; while I generally like the OnePlus 12, its auxiliary lenses don&apos;t quite measure up, so it&apos;s good to see that changing this year.</p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-a-massive-battery-2">There&apos;s a massive battery</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY" name="oneplus-13-official-01" alt="OnePlus 13" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LK6ZtRVbAb4To3UytPsuiY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnePlus)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>One of the biggest changes with the OnePlus 13 is the battery size. The phone features a massive 6000mAh battery, and what&apos;s interesting is that OnePlus is using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/most-android-flagships-are-getting-an-exciting-battery-upgrade-in-2025">silicon-carbon battery tech</a>. The battery uses a silicon-based anode, and this allows better density, allowing the brand to use a bigger battery without increasing the size of the device.</p><p>As a result, even though the OnePlus 13 has a battery that&apos;s 500mAh larger, it is thinner and 7g lighter than the OnePlus 12, and that&apos;s a big deal. The silicon-carbon tech also has better durability, and that should be noticeable after two to three years of use. You still get 100W charging tech, but the charging time is slightly longer as the device is using a single 6000mAh cell this time.</p>
<h2 id="why-you-shouldn-apos-t-wait-x2014-the-oneplus-12-has-a-better-design-2">Why you shouldn&apos;t wait — the OnePlus 12 has a better design</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY" name="oxygenos-15-1.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 with OxygenOS 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GnPze5fyzHuLY7FMUtPGNY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The OnePlus 13 clearly has a lot going for it, and while I&apos;m looking forward to testing the device, I&apos;m not a fan of the new design. OnePlus phones have always followed a similar design aesthetic — going all the way back to the OnePlus 3 — that was characterized by smooth curves and a "horizon line" that made the devices great to hold and use.</p><p>But the OnePlus 13 switches to a blocky design with flat sides, and that just doesn&apos;t look as exciting to me. The renders suggest that the device has beveled edges, so it won&apos;t be as uncomfortable to hold as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro-max-review">iPhone 16 Pro Max</a>, but it still doesn&apos;t have the same elegance as the OnePlus 12.</p>
<h2 id="the-oneplus-12-is-much-more-affordable-2">The OnePlus 12 is much more affordable</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE" name="oneplus-12-2.jpg" alt="OnePlus 12 back against colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KP77ktFmGJABimSRhbDnmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Another factor to consider with the OnePlus 13 is that it comes with a noticeable price hike. Although the device should still cost less than the Pixel 9 Pro XL and the upcoming <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-should-you-wait">Galaxy S25+</a>, there is likely to be a $100 increase over the OnePlus 12 when you account for what the OnePlus 13 is selling for in China.</p><p>That means you may have to pay as much as $899 to get your hands on the device in most global markets. To put things into context, the OnePlus 12 is routinely available for $649, and it will go down to $599 during the upcoming holiday sales window.</p><p>The OnePlus 13 is a better overall device, but is it worth $300 more? I don&apos;t think so at this moment in time. Obviously, I haven&apos;t used the device yet, so I can&apos;t make any qualitative judgement in this regard, but the phone upgrade cycle is such that you don&apos;t get too many noticeable gains year-on-year. </p><p>The OnePlus 13 will be a considerable upgrade if you&apos;re on an older device, but even then, the OnePlus 12 is just as good a choice. If I had to put my own money on the table, I&apos;m picking the OnePlus 12 instead of waiting for the OnePlus 13.</p>

<hr>
<p>The OnePlus 13, fresh off its Chinese launch, just got a new macro feature for its camera through a system update, letting you capture super close-up shots.</p><p>OnePlus announced on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5100612069101992" target="_blank">Weibo</a> that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13">OnePlus 13</a> users can now dive into macro photography (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/OnePlus-13-gets-a-new-camera-feature-ahead-of-global-launch.918271.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). This means users will be able to hit the “little petal” icon (a standard for macro cameras) in the camera app to start capturing all those tiny details.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-goes-official-in-china">Released in late October</a>, the OnePlus 13 packs a punch with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> SoC, up to 24GB of RAM, and fast charging at 100W wired and 50W wireless—making it a strong contender in next year's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android smartphone</a> race.</p><p>OnePlus' latest flagship has been exclusive to China, but executives have confirmed a global launch is just around the corner. So, the new macro photography feature is a great addition ahead of its worldwide debut.</p><p>While the exact date for the phone's global unveiling is still under wraps, rumors hint at a January release, possibly alongside other OnePlus models, and likely at a higher price than its predecessor.</p><p>While there may be some regional differences, it’s set to impress on the software side.</p><p>The OnePlus 13, developed with Hasselblad, originally came with a triple-camera setup but didn’t support a macro camera feature. The latest update fixes that.</p><p>While the exact lens for macro shots isn’t specified, the OnePlus 13's Hasselblad-powered camera system packs a punch with a 50MP f/1.6 main sensor, a 50MP 3x telephoto lens, and a 50MP f/2.0 ultra-wide sensor. Plus, it has a 32MP selfie camera for top-notch self-portraits.</p><p>The update is rolling out in stages, with all compatible devices expected to get it by November 17. Users can check manually by going to <strong>Settings </strong>> <strong>System and Updates</strong> > <strong>Software Update</strong> or speed things up by selecting the "Apply for trial" option in the update settings.</p>

<hr>
<p>T-Mobile's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile-outage-november-12-2024">network went down earlier this week</a>, but now, its original T-Mobile app may be down for good. The app, which became a clone of the carrier's new T-Life app this summer, was recently unlisted from the Google Play Store (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://tmo.report/2024/11/the-t-mobile-app-is-finally-dead-time-to-start-your-t-life/" target="_blank">The Mobile Report</a>). While it still appears to be working for users, it's not available for new downloads, and it's unclear how long the T-Mobile app will remain functional.</p><p>The "un-carrier" has slowly made sweeping changes to its mobile apps throughout the year. In January 2024, it rebranded the T-Mobile Tuesdays app — originally the place for rewards and promotions — to T-Life. Eventually, more features and functionality came to the T-Life app, including account management and chat support.</p><p>This summer, the T-Mobile app was essentially a duplicate version of the T-Life app. The two applications even shared the same logo. The carrier began marketing the T-Life app as the new "everything app" for the company, and sent emails to some customers that pushed them to switch. As such, it seemed like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/carriers/t-mobile">T-Mobile</a> was moving away from the original app that first launched in 2012.</p><p>Now that the T-Mobile app is unavailable for download, it would appear that the transition is now complete. T-Mobile USA currently has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=T-Mobile+USA" target="_blank">22 apps on the Google Play Store</a>, but the original is not one of them. The app's most recent update came earlier this month, although it's unclear whether it'll receive any more updates — or when the app might stop working entirely.</p><p>Android Central has reached out to T-Mobile about the future of the T-Mobile app, and we will update this story when we hear back.</p><p>For now, it may be finally time to switch to the T-Life app if you use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-t-mobile-phones">T-Mobile phone</a> and haven't already. All signs point to the former T-Mobile Tuesdays app becoming the so-called "everything app" for the company.</p>

<ul><li>In a recent change, Partner Sharing in the Google Photos app no longer supports photos that originated from a third-party Android app.</li><li>Google confirmed the shift in an update to a support document made sometime in the last month.</li><li>The change seems to also affect unedited screenshots, and Google didn't explain why Partner Sharing now works differently.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Users picked up on a major change to the way Partner Sharing works in Google Photos this month, and now Google confirmed the shift in an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858?hl=en" target="_blank">updated support document</a>. Partner Sharing will no longer automatically share photos that come from "other apps on Android," according to the document. The confirmation was first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techissuestoday.com/google-photos-android-share-photos-from-other-apps-with-partner-account/" target="_blank">TechIssuesToday</a>, which noted that the support document was updated sometime in the last month based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241008002627/https://support.google.com/photos/answer/7378858" target="_blank">Wayback Machine archives</a>.</p><p>Partner Sharing is a convenient, and automatic, way to share photos with someone you trust, like a family member or significant other. Using this feature, you can choose which photos are automatically shared with your partner. For example, photos can be shared if they include a specific person, or were taken after a specific date.</p><p>Additionally, you can share all photos with a partner if you'd like. Since the feature was introduced in 2017, the <strong>All Photos</strong> option really included every photo, but there are new limitations. Now, there's a disclaimer in the Partner Sharing support document reading: "Tip: Photos from other apps on Android aren't shared with your partner account."</p><p>Reddit users spotted the change about two weeks ago, discovering that certain metadata determines whether a photo is shared or not. Downloads, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-the-pixel-screenshots-app-on-the-google-pixel-9">screenshots</a>, and photos from other Android apps won't be sent to another person with Partner Sharing.</p><p>This doesn't change if you alter the photo's origin in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-photos">Google Photos app</a>, like removing the "screenshot" badge. However, screenshots will be sent through Partner Sharing if they've been edited in Google Photos.</p>
<blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlephotos/comments/1gjyasy/screenshots_not_sharing_through_partner_share">Screenshots not sharing through Partner Share</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlephotos">r/googlephotos</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script>
<p>Google hasn't shared the reasoning behind the changes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-share-your-library-google-photos">Partner Sharing</a>. The move could be to protect user privacy, as some users might want to share their photos but not their downloads, screenshots, or pictures from other apps. With that being said, there are already ways to customize which photos are shared with Partner Sharing, so it's puzzling that Google doesn't give users the option to share photos originating from other apps.</p><p>At the moment, it does not appear that Google is communicating this change directly to users in the Photos app. Though a new <strong>Updates</strong> page in the Photos app now exists for changes like this, Partner Sharing users apparently haven't received a message.</p>

<ul><li>Google published a new support page to inform users of an ongoing problem between Android 15's Private Space and Wear OS watches.</li><li>Users have reportedly received notifications from apps they've stored within Private Space, which isn't how the feature should function.</li><li>Google recently resumed its Wear OS Pixel Watch updates this week after Wear OS 5 caused devices to seize up.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Google's major 2024 Android OS release features enhanced privacy, but the company is aware of a glaring problem.</p><p>The company published <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/wearos/answer/15597337">a support page</a> with information regarding the recently surfaced Private Spaces issues with Wear OS (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2024/11/13/android-15-private-space-wear-os/">9to5Google</a>). Google reiterates that Private Spaces are meant to hide apps that you don't want others to see. However, it notes that some users with a Wear OS device <em>paired with </em>a Private Space-enabled Android phone are receiving notifications.</p><p>The post states users with a Wear OS watch set up to receive "bridged notifications" face this problem.</p><p>Naturally, such devices are not supposed to receive notifications from apps placed within a Private Space. Google states users might receive an alert from an app if their "private space is unlocked on your phone." Moreover, these notifications could appear with a "work profile" icon even if you don't have a profile on your smartphone.</p><p>Google's highlight post lacks information regarding a potential fix for Wear OS devices and Android 15's Private Spaces. The publication assumes a fix <em>could </em>arrive with a future Wear OS or Android 15 patch. At this time, Google hasn't detailed a fix, meaning another may appear later.</p>

<p>During Android 15's launch, one of the major features highlighted was Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-create-private-space-for-your-apps-on-pixel">Private Space</a>. The feature functions like a "digital vault," storing away your sensitive apps that you'd prefer no one else see. Private Space is useful for keeping apps like banking and health separate from the rest of your device. Users can secure the space with a PIN or fingerprint, similar to how you'd lock your phone.</p><p>Unfortunately, Wear OS devices are experiencing a disconnect that defeats the purpose behind hiding these apps in a "private space."</p><p>It's unclear if we are waiting for an update to fix this issue. Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-5-rollout-resumes-for-all-pixel-watch-models-but-theres-a-caveat">resumed its Wear OS updates</a> for the Pixel Watch this week after taking a break to correct a severe software problem. The latest Wear OS 5 upgrade caused several watches to seize up and stop all (proper) functionality.</p><p>More importantly, that update post featured an advisory: the next major OS update won't arrive until March 2025. While that'll be a lengthy wait, hopefully, we won't have to wait that long for a fix for Android 15's Private Space.</p>

It also features up to 13 hours of battery life, along with dual stereo speakers, Dolby Atmos, and a useful headphone jack that some tablets today don't include.</p>

Black Friday discounts are currently being applied to both storage configurations, though not to the version without lockscreen ads. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/dp/B0BHZT5S12" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="49746084-18f5-4253-ad88-c3b2c3ce6e6f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Amazon Fire HD 10 (2023):" data-dimension48="Amazon Fire HD 10 (2023):" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you're looking for something with a long battery life; you don't mind lockscreen ads and just want one of the most affordable tablets there is; you don't expect to need a lot of storage.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you don't want a tablet with lockscreen advertisements; tablets with a good suite of cameras are a priority for you; you'd rather go with a lighter tablet.</p><p>The 2023 Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet is a great little companion, especially at such a low price point. Users love it for its roughly 13 hours of battery life, its 10.1-inch display, and its ease of use for gaming, video streaming,, and more.</p><p>This particular configuration comes with lockscreen ads, and unfortunately, there isn't a deal available for the non-ad version. Still, both the 32GB and 64GB storage options are around half off right now, making these Fire tablets a great deal compared to their usual price point. Storage can also be expanded up to 1TB with the included microSD port.</p><p>It's worth noting that the Fire HD 10 isn't a lightweight tablet, so if this is something that bothers you, it might be worth looking at other options. For those looking to upgrade, it also may be worth considering the slightly larger and better Fire HD 11 tablet, which was launched last year as a more powerful offering from the company.</p>

<ul><li>Spotify announced plans to offer high-fidelity audio to subscribers way back in 2021.</li><li>According to the company's CEO on a recent earnings call, Spotify is still working on delivering lossless audio.</li><li>Unlike the streamer's competitors, Spotify will ask subscribers to pay more for Hi-Fi as part of a "Super Premium" plan.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/spotify">Spotify</a>, the largest music streaming service in the world, is still running into roadblocks that its competitors passed years ago. On an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/q3-2024-spotify-technology-sa-121935633.html" target="_blank">earnings call</a> recapping the company's third-quarter 2024 financial results, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek reaffirmed that lossless audio is still coming, but didn't provide an exact timeline. The higher-quality subscription tier was first announced in 2021, and has faced significant delays since.</p><p>Tidal, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-music">Amazon Music</a> already offer high-fidelity audio to subscribers as part of their standard subscription tiers. However, Spotify wants its subscribers to pay extra for the luxury, despite being extremely behind in the lossless audio game. The upgraded tier became known as "Super Premium," and recent comments from Ek suggest this subscription could cost as much as $5 more than Premium.</p><p>Aside from lossless quality, Spotify's boss says that Super Premium will include “a bunch of other things.” More importantly, Ek thinks that Spotify users will pay extra for a Super Premium subscription because, well, they love Spotify.</p><p>"The principle for us is always the same, which is how do we create something that consumers love, but that also delivers value back to creators," Ek said on the earnings call. "And you can go back to vinyl buyers, you can go back to all of these superfans that already exist to look for clues in what some of the things are that they value."</p>

<p>Despite the delays to CD-quality audio, Spotify is growing beyond its internal projections. The company reported having 640 million monthly active users as of Q3 2024, and revenue up 19% year-over-year. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/spotify">Spotify</a> stock trended upward following the earning's call and financial release, but the Super Premium tier remains a question mark for the company. Can it deliver high-fidelity audio to subscribers, and are there enough Spotify users willing to pay a premium for it?</p>

<ul><li>A report claims Samsung has added a "double-folding phone" to its development plans, which could fold "inward" for durability.</li><li>The phone is suspected to launch with a nine to 10-inch display when unfolded, similar to Huawei's Mate XT.</li><li>A report from September claimed Samsung was moving toward its rollable phone concept shown during CES 2024.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Rumors of a tri-fold or "double-folding" Galaxy device return as a report claims Samsung is rethinking such a device.</p><p>A report by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20241114000332">ETNews</a> claims Samsung "recently added a double-folding phone to its development lineup" (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-double-folding-phone-launch-next-year-3499641/">Android Authority</a>). Huawei's release of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-ultimate-design-launch">the Mate XT</a> is likely a strong catalyst for Samsung as it seeks to debut a similar device. The publication's report states that the Korean OEM's version could fold "inward."</p><p>An alleged insider claims this is done to improve its durability as folding outward would make the phone "vulnerable to drops and impacts."</p><p>Rumors purport its specifications, claiming this double-folding device could offer a display size of nine to 10 inches when fully open. Supposedly, the device will remain similar in size to a "regular" slab phone when collapsed. This seems plausible as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> looks like a regular smartphone when closed, but fully expanding it gives it more of a tablet vibe.</p><p>With this report, the publication's source claims that Samsung's partners "have also begun development projects." Additionally, the company is rumored to have the "release model finalized" by the end of November.</p><p>The post states Samsung could debut this double-folding/"multifold" device in 2025. Allegedly, the company may slip this phone in alongside its annual launch of the Flip and Fold series.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3EYFwuprUs7PqrG6M32Nif" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-6-flex.jpg" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 main display folded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3EYFwuprUs7PqrG6M32Nif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>This report goes against Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-rollable-phone-pursuit-alleged-report">rumored course of action</a> following the Mate XT's launch. In September, rumors claimed the Korean OEM was distancing itself from a device with two hinges in favor of its previously showcased <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-display-foldable-rollable-tech-concepts-ces-2024">rollable concept</a>. The company had filed patents for a tri-fold device in South Korea and the U.S., but the device never came to fruition.</p><p>Speculation suggested the device could arrive with a 12.4-inch display when "rolled out" completely. It was also rumored to feature an under-display selfie camera.</p><p>The report also highlighted Samsung's displeasure with its recent Flip 6 and Fold 6 devices. Those phones had fallen "short of expectations," likely pushing the company to seek other avenues.</p><p>With rumors going back on previous reports, it's best to take this speculation with a grain of salt.</p>

<ul><li>Typically, Samsung uses a combination of Qualcomm Snapdragon chips and its own Exynos chips.</li><li>A leaker with a reliable track record claims that the entire Galaxy S25 lineup will be powered by Snapdragon 8 Elite, in all markets.</li><li>If true, the Galaxy S25 would only be the third Galaxy S lineup to be exclusively powered by a Qualcomm system-on-a-chip.</li></ul>
<hr>
<p>Samsung often sells its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">flagship phones</a> with different processors, depending on your region. For example, some versions of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s24">Samsung Galaxy S24 series</a> shipped with Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 systems-on-a-chip (SoCs), while others featured the Exynos 2400. This comes with benefits and drawbacks: Snapdragon phones are typically faster, while Exynos handsets are more efficient. Looking ahead to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25</a> lineup, one reliable leaker claims that all phones will be Snapdragon-powered, in all markets.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1856677902869516626" target="_blank">Ice Universe</a>, a leaker with a solid track record on all things Samsung, reiterated their position in a post on X (formerly Twitter). The tipster predicts that every Galaxy S25 model worldwide will have Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite on the inside, the company's newest SoC.</p>
<div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I reiterate that all versions of the Galaxy S25 series in the world adopt Snapdragon 8 Elite, and will not adopt Exynos.<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1856677902869516626">November 13, 2024</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div>
<p>Snapdragon chips usually beat their Exynos counterparts in performance, but that disparity could be even greater in 2025. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite</a> uses Qualcomm's custom Oryon cores, which helped the chipmaker find immense success with its Snapdragon X lineup of laptop-class processors. That, plus prior reports of low yield rates for Samsung's Exynos processors, could explain why the Korean tech giant is going all-in on Snapdragon.</p><p>One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.hankyung.com/amp/2024101722011" target="_blank">report</a> out of Korea last month said that low yield rates for the Exynos 2500 chipset, expected to power some Galaxy S25 models, forced Samsung to change its plans. Another, more recent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newsway.co.kr/news/view?ud=2024110612112748553" target="_blank">report</a> suggests that Samsung Foundry's yield woes haven't improved since then. It claimed Samsung's yield rate for 3nm chips was less than 20%, which is an unsustainable figure.</p><p>Combined, all these rumors and reports point to Ice Universe's claim that the Galaxy S25 will be exclusively Snapdragon-powered being correct. If true, it would only be the third time Samsung didn't use an Exynos chip in a Galaxy S lineup in at least some regions. The last time that happened was when the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s23-review">Galaxy S23</a> series launched with only the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy platform.</p><p>However, the Samsung Galaxy S25 lineup being exclusively powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite might come with pros and cons. Though the chipset looks to be plenty fast, it's more expensive than its predecessor, leading some to believe the Galaxy S25 could launch with a price hike.</p>
