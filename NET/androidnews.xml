Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google was hard at work upgrading the Gemini app in November, giving users a new large language model (LLM), image-generation model, and video-generation model. These updates rolled out gradually throughout the month, and are recapped in Google's latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-drop-november-2025/" target="_blank">Gemini Drop</a> for November. If you haven't followed every singe announcement, this is a great way to figure out the new Gemini app you need to try.</p><p>The big change is the addition of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-gemini-3-available-now-everything-you-need-to-know">Gemini 3</a>, the company's latest and greatest LLM. Google calls it the "most intelligent model" it has ever made, with deep understanding and stellar vibe coding abilities. The update first debuted on the Gemini web client, and now, it's available in the Gemini app on iOS and Android.</p><p>To use it, tap the current model listed at the bottom of the Gemini app home screen — usually <strong>2.5 Flash</strong> — to open the model selector. Then, tap <strong>Thinking</strong> to switch to the preview Gemini 3 Pro model, the first one to release as part of the next-generation Gemini 3 series. The release corresponds with a new Gemini mobile app view, which adds a <strong>My Stuff</strong> page <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-tweaks-geminis-android-app-with-a-fresh-homepage-and-my-stuff-view">for images, videos, and Canvas content</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV" name="Gemini-App-Redesign-Nov-2025" alt="The various Gemini app screens tweaked in a Nov 2025 redesign." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vR6sqrw6adL4z7FVkmy4hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google also changed out the Gemini app's image- and video-generation models this month. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/nano-banana-goes-pro-with-refined-design-consistency-and-accuracy-in-the-gemini-app">Nano Banana Pro</a> (Gemini 3 Pro Image) replaces Nano Banana (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) in the Gemini app as the default image generator, at least to start. Free users get a few free generations before the model reverts back to Nano Banana, while Google AI Plus, Pro, and Ultra subscribers get higher rate limits.</p><p>For videos, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-veo-steps-up-its-creativity-in-3-1-version-update-for-realism">Veo 3.1</a> is the default video-generation model, and it now supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-for-gemini-app-users-to-generate-videos-from-photos">the <strong>Ingredients to Video</strong> feature</a> first made available in Flow. It allows users to upload three images that will guide a video prompt, and it aims to shorten the length of prompts needed to generate a requested video. Between the addition of Nano Banana Pro and Veo 3.1 Ingredients to Video, it's clear the new My Stuff section of the Gemini app is part of a content-generation push.</p><p>For Google AI Ultra subscribers, the cornerstone feature added in November is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-gemini-agent-can-orchestrate-complex-tasks-on-your-behalf-in-the-gemini-app">Gemini Agent</a>. It can take actions on your behalf in the Google ecosystem and beyond, all while prioritizing user control. Gemini Agent is based on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/googles-latest-ai-model-gemini-2-0-is-here-to-usher-in-the-agentic-era">Project Mariner</a>, the browser use tool that began testing in 2024.</p><p>Gemini Live also added "more adaptive and expressive" conversations this month, allowing users to customize the speed and tone of the AI assistant's responses.</p><h2 id="what-s-next-for-gemini-2">What's next for Gemini? </h2><p>Google had a busy month shipping Gemini features in November, and the compilation of them in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-drop-november-2025/" target="_blank">November Gemini Drop</a> suggests we've already seen the best additions this month has to offer. There's plenty to look forward too, though.</p><p>The company is currently safety testing Gemini 3 Deep Think, an even smarter AI model that will come to Google AI Ultra subscribers in the coming weeks. Google also confirmed that more Gemini 3 models will be released "soon" to join Gemini 3 Pro in preview. We're likely to see a lightweight model, like Gemini 3 Flash or something similar, to replace or join Gemini 2.5 Flash for basic queries.</p><p>Google could also expand limited features, like Gemini Agent, to more users in the future. We'll have to wait until the December Gemini Drop to find out.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Here are my thoughts on the new Oura Ring 4 model and redesigned Oura app ]]></title>
                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>A year after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring 4</a> launched, the company introduced a new ceramic version of the wearable. As someone who has been using the original titanium version of the ring since it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-launch">launched in October 2024</a>, I was excited to get my hands on this new, stylish take on the device, which Oura says “is designed to stand up to daily life while blending style and function.”</p><p>But it wasn't just the Oura Ring that got a glow-up; the Oura app was recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ouraring.com/blog/new-app-design/?srsltid=AfmBOoqh2CEdKQgL5ahUs70npvxKRQJaTLD_Nwd06Ml-GweYjW7SVLJb">updated with a new design</a> that gives my Android phone a touch of iOS. Both of these updates highlight how Oura is not just a health and wellness product, but also a lifestyle one, making wearable tech that blends in while also standing out.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring/oura-unveils-stylish-ceramic-rings-and-its-first-ever-charging-case">new ceramic ring</a> doesn't come cheap, though, and you'll pay a hefty premium over the cheapest Oura Ring 4 model to get the new material.</p><p>After a month of using the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic, is it worth the extra cost, or should you just spring for a cheaper finish?</p><h2 id="pretty-in-premium-2">Pretty in premium</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="HSZfunYBNtiPbWx3gZsMcX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-09" alt="Wearing the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HSZfunYBNtiPbWx3gZsMcX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oura isn't the first to bring a ceramic finish to its products, and I hope it isn't the last. The Oura Ring 4 Ceramic takes what I think was already a winning design and steps it up a couple of notches with a material that both looks and feels quite premium when compared to the titanium Oura Ring 4.</p><p>The new ceramic finish feels incredibly soft to the touch, a stark contrast to the more rigid and titanium finishes. The difference is quite noticeable, particularly with how easily my finger glides across the ring.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3906px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iC9KwGjoPsp69z9ua2KtbX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-21" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic next to the Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iC9KwGjoPsp69z9ua2KtbX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3906" height="2197" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="n4KcH5VUdMNg8V2rrsXmHV" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-02" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic and Oura Ring 4 side by side" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/n4KcH5VUdMNg8V2rrsXmHV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="Lbj6Zubjg8zCH8HbkosxxX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-23" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic and the Oura Ring 4 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lbj6Zubjg8zCH8HbkosxxX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3692px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="nGSRGnBnQ5atZi5SbYCxGX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-03" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic and Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nGSRGnBnQ5atZi5SbYCxGX.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="3692" height="2077" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>My unit is the Cloud color, which is an off-white hue, although there are three other options to choose from, including Tide (light green) and Petal (light pink). Most are pastels except for the Midnight blue option, which has a deeper hue and is probably my favorite of the lot. According to Oura, the colors were chosen "to complement a wide range of skin tones and personal styles."</p><p>Oura also notes that the ring should retain its hue over time, thanks to a process that creates the colors "with minerals inherent to the ceramic material itself," as opposed to using a surface color that can eventually fade.</p><p>In my use, I've noticed some areas where the color has seemingly been scratched off. You'll want to avoid handling certain objects that could scratch against the ring, like a metal dumbbell. Otherwise, I normally wear a rubber "case" around the Oura Ring, and it appears to work well enough to keep it from scratching. Unfortunately, Oura still doesn't offer first-party ring protectors, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CSYWTR51"><strong>I've found some on Amazon</strong></a> that work well.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="f2ufr2uKPWMVZeE9QiDT4X" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-18" alt="Scratches on the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/f2ufr2uKPWMVZeE9QiDT4X.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, Oura does provide a Ceramic Polishing Pad, which should be able to handle scuffs and scratches to make your Oura Ring like new again, although I didn't receive one with my unit.</p><p>If you're comparing the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic with the titanium model, you'll notice that the new finish makes the ring noticeably thicker and a bit heavier. The size of the ring never bothered me, although some of my friends have pointed out how they find the Oura Ring unpleasantly thick, so the new finish may not appeal to everyone despite its rather premium look.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3913px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PW6nChTiK22x56QEyaFViX" name="Oura-Ring-4-Ceramic-22" alt="Oura Ring 4 Ceramic next to the Oura Ring 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PW6nChTiK22x56QEyaFViX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3913" height="2201" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Otherwise, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic and titanium Oura Ring 4 are pretty much the same.

The vitals shortcuts at the top of the view have a design that almost resembles matte glass, and as you scroll up, the UI elements will blur into the top of the display before disappearing.</p><p>Oura says the new card design "uses colors to signal your body’s different states according to your biometrics," while the My Health view provides a more visual glance at your long-term metrics.</p><div

Many <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">smart rings</a> can still end up looking very much like tech, while Oura is trying to balance that out with a refined sense of style.</p><p>Unfortunately, that doesn't come cheap, with the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic priced at $499. That's $150 more than the cheapest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/which-oura-ring-4-color-should-you-buy">Oura Ring 4 color options</a>, although it matches the price of the more expensive Gold and Rose Gold options. So, if you were already looking at the latter colors, you might want to give the Ceramic models a look. Otherwise, I would have a hard time recommending anyone spend this much on a smart ring, especially when you account for the subscription.</p><p>It's also worth noting that the titanium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9WWB3WX/"><strong>Oura Ring 4 is currently on sale for Black Friday</strong></a>, with as much as $150 off, depending on the color.</p><p>On the plus side, the Oura Ring 4 Ceramic is still FSA/HSA eligible, so you can use that purchase one.

Truthfully, I LOVE seeing great deals on my favorite foldable phones, because it immediately squashes one of the most common hurdles that people face: the price.</p><p>While Google didn't raise the price of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold over its predecessor, the $1,800 price tag can be a tough pill to swallow, even when the payments are split up and added to your monthly bill. So with this deal, instead of shelling out enough money to cover a month of rent for a one-bedroom apartment somewhere, you're getting a 10 Pro Fold for the price of a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/somehow-this-unbelievable-pixel-10-deal-returned">Pixel 10</a>!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5244px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review-13" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold Review" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GmrLG3cJj2pc7UJqQyRs9o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5244" height="2950" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going hand in hand with the price hurdle is the concern about durability with foldable phones in general. We can thank Google for this one, as it looks to squash any worries for those considering the 10 Pro Fold, thanks to its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof" target="_blank">IP68 water- and dust-resistance</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-waterproof"> rating</a>.</p><p>Frankly, I thought Samsung might've gotten there first with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>, especially after removing the S Pen digitizer.

My biggest complaint has been how it lacks the flagship camera experience you would find with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><p>I mean, Samsung managed to make its foldable thinner than a #2 pencil, but upgraded the primary camera to feature the same 200MP lens as the Galaxy S25 Ultra.

And while that might be fine for some people, others could be looking for a bit of a style switch-up. That's where the Nothing Phone 3 comes in, and with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Unlocked-Snapdragon-Interface-Smartphone/dp/B0F9XXHSCG/?th=1"><strong>first 20% off sale</strong></a> of the year, it's easy to finally get a phone that's as unique as you.</p><p>In our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3 review</a>, we praised the phone, saying "the Phone 3 is nothing short of the brand's best device. The design is all grown up, but you still get the quintessential Nothing ethos with bold styling and a new Glyph Matrix LED at the back."</p><p>To make things even better, Nothing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-arrives-for-the-phone-3-with-exclusive-features-refined-glyph-interface-and-more"><em>just</em> released Nothing OS 4.0</a> based on Android 16, which comes with a host of impressive new features you're going to love.

Neither of these things is bad on the phone, but other phones on sale during Black Friday may offer better specs.</p><p>The Nothing Phone 3 is the company's first phone to sport full U.S. support, including open sales at everyone's favorite retailers and compatibility with the uniquely weird wireless networks here. That also includes proper support for U.S. customers, something that wasn't always guaranteed with previous models sold under the "beta" program.</p><p>This phone is a particularly good recommendation here in the U.S. because, quite simply, we have very few smartphone options available when compared to the rest of the world. Nothing stands out as a UK brand with unique design characteristics, including a fast and fluid OS that isn't a bloated mess, plus the unique Glyph Matrix screen on the back that adds a bit of fun to the otherwise bland smartphone game.</p><p>Our review pointed out that what was offered here simply wasn't worth the $799 starting price, but $639 is a substantially better place to start. That's particularly where this deal excels, and it makes this unique phone an easy recommendation when you don't have $1000 or more to spend.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6ae6a556-5d88-4548-8cbf-b311318b78d4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="This clear case feels great and doesn't ruin the unique look of your Nothing Phone 3.

Nelson hops right into the fire with the device, placing his sticky strip of numbers, marking the Mohs Scale of Hardness test's beginning. The phone features Gorilla Victus Glass 2, which begins to show signs of scratching at a level six, with even deeper marks at level seven.</p><p>The display even stands in the midst of the YouTuber's flame test without flinching or asking, "What's burning?"</p><p>The test moves to the back of the phone, which makes Nelson scratch his head a little. For context, he is using the Sandstone variant of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">OnePlus 15</a>, which utilizes a plastic material for its rear panel reinforced with fiber. This is unlike the other OnePlus 15 options that offer a glass back. Nelson didn't mind it, stating that he'd prefer plastic, considering it won't "shatter" if broken, like glass would. He can "deal with" the scratches over the shattered.</p><p>The side rails of the phone are quite durable, as well. Though there are incredibly obvious marks on it from his blade, Nelson states OnePlus' new coating will "handle regular scrapes and bumps better."</p><p>The moment most look forward to (and dread) is the bend test. Nelson applies the usual force to the OnePlus, and while it does bend ever-so-slightly with his thumbs on the front display, from behind, there is "no flex." You can watch the rest of Zack Nelson's durability test for the OnePlus 15 and learn more about the company's attempts at cooling the phone.</p><h2 id="it-s-here-and-it-s-showing-off-2">It's here, and it's showing off</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vCqX0ZkoPMU" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The OnePlus 15 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-debuts-early-worldwide-but-us-fans-have-a-longer-wait">launched just last week</a> with camera upgrades and even more performance enhancements.</p><p>The Chinese OEM applied Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC to power its major functions and brought in a triple 50MP camera array. What's also quite different on the OnePlus 15 is its design. The company revamped the phone's rear panel, dropping that side-mounted circular design for a more square array toward the top left of its back panel.</p><p>Moreover, the OnePlus 15 says goodbye to the flagship series' old Alert Slider in favor of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-ai-upgrade-for-oneplus-13-and-13s">Plus Key for AI</a>. While the OnePlus 15 doesn't sport Hasselblad tuning, since the company has started down its own path from the lessons learned, the phone's cameras are still pretty good, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">maybe better than most others</a>.</p><p>The OnePlus 15 is going for $899, but the device is on a delay in the U.S. When the phone launched, the U.S. government shutdown prevented it from debuting in the States. OnePlus plans to bring it to the U.S., but it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-delayed-us-availability">must seek FCC approval</a> first before doing so.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>There's plenty of competition in music streaming, with Spotify leading the pack. Apple Music and YouTube Music aren't far behind, and there are niche options like Deezer, Tidal, and Amazon Music too. Switching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-streaming-music-apps-android">music streaming services</a> can be stressful, as users worry they'll use their stats, playlists, and music libraries. In an effort to court new subscribers, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> is adding in-app TuneMyMusic playlist transfers to make the process of switching nearly seamless.</p><p>The company is partnering with TuneMyMusic to bring the versatile library transfer tool to the Spotify app. TuneMyMusic supports playlist transfers between Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Deezer, and more services, and it has a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tunemymusic.com" target="_blank">web client</a>. It can transfer, share, or backup your music library, or use AI to create "the perfect playlist" based on its contents.</p><p>However, this process previously relied on users knowing about TuneMyMusic and seeking out the web-based transfer tool. Spotify's in-app TuneMyMusic integration completely removes that barrier to entry, making it easier for users to switch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4654px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK" name="spotify-wrapped-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold" alt="Andrew's Spotify Wrapped 2024 on the Pixel 9 Pro Fold" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yV6UbV7GLa5oDRF6JrvgsK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4654" height="2618" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Now, Spotify users can scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Your Library</strong> tab in the app, where they'll find an <strong>Import your music</strong> button. A few prompts will appear that connect to the TuneMyMusic service, where users can select the streaming service they want to transfer from. After that, users need only to select the playlists they want to import, and continue to have everything appear in their Spotify app library.</p><p>This feature reduces the friction involved in switching music streaming services, and it's available now on the iOS and Android versions of the Spotify app. It's rolling out globally over the next few days.</p><h2 id="the-other-ways-you-can-switch-music-streaming-services-2">The other ways you can switch music streaming services</h2><p>It's worth noting that TuneMyMusic will help you transfer a library to or from any of the following services, plus some others: Spotify, Tidal, Apple Music, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, and Deezer. Spotify is the only streaming service to integrate TuneMyMusic directly into its mobile streamer. However, you can use the TuneMyMusic web client to transfer <em>from</em> Spotify to another music streaming service as well.</p><p>It's not the first time streaming companies have banded together to make switching easier. Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-music-youtube-music-playlist-transfer">Apple Music and YouTube Music partnered in 2024</a> to create library transfer tools between its music streaming services.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This would enable the case to emit sound when lost, addressing the frustration of digging for silent earbuds between sofa cushions.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Perplexity's AI-assisted browser, Comet, is making its way onto handheld Android devices this week.</p><p>Perplexity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/comet-for-android-is-here">announced</a> that its AI browser, Comet, is making its way from larger devices onto Android in a blog post. The company is highlighting the Comet browser as the user's "constant companion," capable of helping with anything they need or come across while browsing the web. This browsing assistant is capable of answering user questions and "taking action" on tasks you assign it.</p><p>Moreover, Perplexity states Android users can utilize the assistant's "expanded reasoning" to see what actions it's taking to fulfill their query and step in if necessary.</p><p>Taking Comet's assistance to another level is voice control. Users on Android can talk with Comet about anything they've got open on their browser. This includes the current page you're on, as well as all other open tabs, even if you're not there. Something Comet can do is "summarize your searches." This feature works across every open tab, meaning if you're conducting some research and have multiple pages open, Comet can quickly summarize everything to save you time.</p><p>The Comet browser is also quite conscious about only showing you what's important. Perplexity states the browser dodges spam and ads with a built-in ad blocker. Additionally, Comet for Android features a whitelist for websites you trust, just like its desktop counterpart.</p><h2 id="from-early-access-to-a-launch-on-mobile-2">From early access to a launch on mobile</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Asr9huXuheI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Other than summarizing tabs, Perplexity highlights Comet's ability to shop for the user. If there's something specific you're looking for, say, a price range for an item, and the retailer, you can give instructions to Comet, and it'll shop for you. What's more, Comet can understand content from an online textbook and can even quiz the user on the information there, if told to.</p><p>Comet is already available on the Google Play Store for download, meaning Android users can grab it today and get started.</p><p>After a limited launch in July, Perplexity <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/comet-is-now-available-to-everyone-worldwide">released its Comet browser</a> for all users, for free, back in October. It was evident during its initial test that Perplexity dared to develop an AI assistant that was there for the user throughout their entire browsing session, not just for the little things, like a chatbot. The company stresses its ability to aid in e-commerce, research, meetings, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In a press release, the company says the Phone 3 is receiving the update today, alongside a few exclusive Android 16 features, too. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Phone 3</a> gains improved Flip to Glyph controls that let users choose between "silent" or "vibrate" modes.

Intwined in the Glyph Interface, Live Updates provide their usual set of real-time information for deliveries and rides; however, the Glyph Interface's involvement offers light-based cues to help users track.</p><p>Nothing states that "any app" in Android 16 that supports Live Updates can be used with Nothing's Glyph Progress feature.</p><p>Extra Dark Mode arrives as an updated variant of what users have experienced before. Now, Nothing states the mode "deepens blacks, improves contrast, and reduces power use across the system." The company's own apps, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/how-use-nothing-essential-space">Essential Space</a> and Launcher support Extra Dark Mode, but Nothing is planning to expand this to even more apps.</p><p>Interactions are another major aspect of Nothing OS 4.0, as Nothing highlights its updated haptic feedback. When adjusting your volume, a "subtle" haptic feedback will alert you to your volume's maximum and minimum. Opening and closing apps should look much smoother than before, while notifications carry "a subtle sense of weight and rebound."</p><h2 id="nothing-os-4-0-highlights-2">Nothing OS 4.0 Highlights</h2><ul><li>More Widget Sizes — Design your home screen your way. New 1×1 and 2×1 layouts for Weather, Pedometer and Screen Time let you build a balanced setup that surfaces what matters most while keeping the space minimal.</li><li>Pop-Up View — You can now open two floating apps at once and switch between them with simple gestures.

And the Charge 6, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M"><strong>has fallen to $99 on Amazon</strong></a> for Black Friday, is Fitbit's newest device that's not a Pixel Watch or kids' watch, making it most likely to sell out first.</p><p>Of course, since we're getting <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/google-promises-new-fitbit-hardware-in-2026-past-statements-suggest-which">new Fitbit hardware in 2026</a>, you can always try to hold out for a Fitbit Charge 7. But there's reason to get excited now, as Google is completely revamping the Fitbit app to make it more personalized and intelligent. And the sooner you start giving Fitbit data, the more that the new AI coach will have to work with.</p><p>If you're <em>not</em> interested in AI insights, however, then there's no reason to buy a Fitbit Charge 6, or any other Fitbit, no matter how good the prices get. Google has tied Fitbit's future to Gemini, giving it an intelligent advantage that other fitness brands can't match, but <em>you</em> may not care enough about AI to pay for it.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="84e3d84d-6211-48fc-8f57-2c2179e2ab1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$99.95" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Exercise-Equipment-6-Months-Membership/dp/B0CC62ZG1M" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="RtTiyhF44bj2uMfaDzxzCe" name="fitbit charge 6 reco 600x600.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RtTiyhF44bj2uMfaDzxzCe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit-charge-6-review" data-dimension112="84e3d84d-6211-48fc-8f57-2c2179e2ab1a" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension48="Android Central verdict:" data-dimension25="$99.95"><strong>Android Central verdict: </strong>★★★★½</a></p><p>The Fitbit Charge 6 threads the needle between fitness band and smartwatch, with a more usable 1-inch display and better sensors than a Fitbit Inspire 3, but with a lighter design and more reasonable price than a Sense 2.

It's only available on Android phones for Premium subscribers in the United States to start, but the beta will launch more widely by the end of 2025. And the final, stable version will launch on Android and iOS sometime in 2026.</p><p>Some of you may decide to wait for the final, stable version to launch, rather than buy the Fitbit Charge 6 now when it's still using the older Fitbit app. But if you're willing to play with beta software, it's an exciting time to get back into the Fitbit ecosystem.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

a NAS? </h2><p>A NAS, or Network Attached Storage, is a physical piece of hardware that's designed specifically for large file storage. Unlike Cloud storage, which holds your files in some remote location, a NAS enclosure is a physical server in your home that you can access and manage at any time with any device you own.</p><p>NAS servers are more than just glorified flash drives, however. These enclosures boast their own operating systems, RAM, and transfer speed, so you're paying for the hardware just as much as the storage capacity. They aren't for everyone, but if you want the ability to store all of your media in one centralized location, a NAS server is a great buy.</p><h2 id="which-nas-is-best-2">Which NAS is best?</h2><p>Although it depends on your individual needs, we generally recommend the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/synology-diskstation-ds224-plus-review">Synology DiskStation DS224+</a> as the best NAS for most people. This enclosure boasts powerful hardware with lightning-fast transfer speeds, and two 18TB bays. Unfortunately, the DS224+ hasn't received a Black Friday discount just yet, but I'll update this guide immediately if that changes.</p><h2 id="when-is-black-friday-2025-2">When is Black Friday 2025?</h2><p>Black Friday is technically set for November 28th, the day after the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States.

If you want a first-party leather band for your 45mm Garmin Venu 4, black is your only option. At least it matches everything!</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><ul><li><a href="#main"><strong>Back to the top ^</strong></a></li></ul><h2 id="choosing-the-right-garmin-venu-4-watch-band-2">Choosing the right Garmin Venu 4 watch band</h2><p>Just like the Garmin Venu 4, almost all the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> support universal quick-release bands. You just have to match the right-sized band to the case size of your model. If you've got the 41mm Venu 4, any 18mm quick-release band will fit it. And if you opted for the larger 45mm variant, stick with 22mm quick-release bands for perfect compatibility.</p><p>The Garmin Venu 4 comes with either a silicone or a leather band. Most people usually buy the silicone band set as it's a whole $50 cheaper than the leather strap bundle. If you fall into that category and are looking for an extra band, I suggest grabbing a metal watch band two-pack first. Both the ViCRiOR 18mm set and the GARTOO Metal Bands for Garmin 22mm kit are extremely affordable, priced below $20, and are made of waterproof stainless steel. This means they won't blacken over time, and neither will they get scratched or bent easily. A metal band is the fastest way to elevate any wearable, so don't skip this option!</p><p>Next, if you've still got some extra dough, I suggest getting a fabric band for everyday use. The Garmin Quick Release Bands ComfortFit Fabric comes in both 18mm and 22mm sizes, although the color options differ across sizes. Fabric is a sturdy material, comfortable, and more breathable compared to silicone or leather. The band's length is easily adjustable, which is another bonus.

According to them, it remains uncertain if these screens will include other potential improvements, such as support for 10-bit color depth or high-frequency pulse-width modulation (PWM) dimming.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a Samsung leaker, I am basically sure that it will adopt M14 material and Polless screen technology, but I can't guarantee that it will adopt 10bit technology and PWM high-frequency dimming. I advise you not to be too optimistic. https://t.co/WicBrzvunb<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1991420299292864522">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Furthermore, the leak suggests that Samsung could use its new M14 material in its display despite sticking to the same brightness.  These OLED panels with "Color Filter on Encapsulation" (CoE) are said to reduce thickness and power consumption, which could contribute to increased efficiency, resulting in reduced power consumption and enhanced long-term reliability.</p><p>"This is not a good sign. Display brightness has stayed unchanged for several generations, and it inevitably raises suspicion that Samsung has started cutting corners on the screen," Ice Universe added.</p><p>While we might not see a significant increase in brightness to 3,000 nits or more, like the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 12, which belong to the 4,500 nits club, Samsung is reportedly planning other enhancements to improve the display of its next flagship series.</p><p>The most exciting rumor for the Galaxy S26 lineup (specifically the Ultra) is the debut of "Flex Magic Pixel" technology, which is a privacy feature that uses AI to electronically narrow viewing angles so that people can peer into your screen, effectively killing the need for physical privacy screen protectors, which dim the display of your device.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Meta Quest gamers don't want to play lousy free-to-play games on their phones <em>through the Meta Quest app</em>. Likewise, Ray-Ban or Oakley Meta users have no desire to browse AI slop Instagram reels when they're just trying to connect to their smart glasses.</p><p>Meta needs to return to its roots and provide users with what they want, rather than continuing to inject its unwanted content into unrelated apps. If users really want to browse AI-generated social media, make it a new tab in the Instagram app. If some mobile gamers want to join Horizon Worlds on their phones, make it a separate app.</p><p>Heck, dropping that in the Facebook app makes a lot more sense than it being in the Meta Quest app, especially when putting this content front and center is contributing to lower sales on your own video game platform.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google might be working on changing one of the most familiar parts of your phone: the moment it rings. Recent code found in the Phone by Google app suggests that Android users might soon be able to tag a call as “urgent” and possibly get through someone’s Do Not Disturb mode.</p><p>The folks at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-phone-urgent-expressive-calling-3618392/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a> have unearthed a potential feature called Expressive Calling, which could change how we grab someone’s attention when a regular ring won’t cut it.</p><p>The ringing on your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phone</a> is an anxiety-inducing lottery. Is it a spam bot about your car’s extended warranty? Or is it your kid’s school calling with an actual emergency? Many people use Do Not Disturb to avoid distractions and only allow important calls. But if something really matters, calling someone repeatedly isn’t a great solution.</p><p>That’s where Expressive Calling steps in. A teardown of the app shows strings that let you pick a "call reason" before the phone starts ringing, with options ranging from “It's urgent!” to friendlier tags like “News to share” or “Quick question,” complete with emoji.</p><h2 id="dnd-bypass-maybe-2">DND bypass (maybe)</h2><p>If the feature works as expected, the urgent tag could bypass Do Not Disturb, but only if you’re in the person’s contacts. This is important because it prevents unknown callers from disturbing you.</p><p>This feature appears to rely on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-rcs-and-why-it-important-android">RCS</a> and SMS permissions, so both sides of the call may need compatible apps or features turned on. Without that support, the call reason might not show at all.</p><p>For users on the receiving end, Android could surface something like “Missed an Urgent Call,”  so you know it wasn’t just a regular call. Make sure you’re using the Google Phone app, since other dialers might not support this feature when it launches.</p><p>As with many unreleased features, this one could change or even be canceled before it’s released. Google hasn’t announced a launch timeline, and early versions of Expressive Calling don’t appear to be live for anyone yet.</p><p>However, the level of detail in the code makes it feel like a feature waiting for its debut, possibly first on Pixel phones before coming to other Android devices.</p> ]]></dc:content>

I tried it out as soon as it was available <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-ai-just-created-the-next-evolution-of-the-photosphere">and was blown away</a> by the quality captured by my Meta Quest 3 headset. Locations I visited and scanned were fully walkable while wearing my headset, making me feel like I was right there.</p><p>Despite the ultra-realistic graphics, Meta has been able to port Hyperspace environments into its fledgling Horizon Worlds Engine, allowing players to share and visit locations together. Better yet, you don't even need a headset to try this out, just the Meta Horizon app from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oculus.twilight&hl=en_US">Google Play Store</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/meta-horizon/id1366478176">Apple Appstore</a>.</p><p>In <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/blog/hyperscape-worlds-sharing-hangout-friends-metaverse-digital-replicas/">a blog post</a>, Meta explains that all you need to do is visit a Hyperscape world — it can be one of your own or one of the existing Meta-created ones, like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://horizon.meta.com/world/24916576431327058/">Gordon Ramsay's kitchen</a> — then just tap the share link and send it to anyone you want to have join you in the world.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Previously, everything was rendered via Meta's cloud and streamed live to your headset, but now things are rendered in realtime on the hardware you're using. That means your Quest headset or smartphone is doing all the work, and it ensures that you and your friends get a smooth experience when playing together.</p><p>Meta suggests inviting friends or family who can't visit for the holidays and using that to spend a little quality hangout time with them. Certainly not a terrible idea, if I do say so myself. Meta says it will continue improving this feature and hopes to allow even more than eight people in a future update. If you don't see the share option right away, check back later as Meta is rolling the update out to players in waves.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="160c4629-3dca-4ec2-b4e3-de9cc1a7f001">            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B0F2GYMC8H/" data-model-name="Quest 3S" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fCUPHg8DY6xth6JoYMuDGK.jpg' alt="An official product render of the Meta Quest 3S with its controllers"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Meta</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Quest 3S</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>This year's mind-blowing Meta Quest 3S sale brings it down to an effective <strong>$199</strong>!

The main highlight here is that Matter 1.5 now supports cameras. According to the CSA, this new camera support brings in live video and audio streaming.</p><p>Not only is this something consumers can look forward to, but they can also look ahead to "support for multi-stream configurations, pan-tilt-zoom controls, detection and privacy zones, and flexible storage options."</p><p>On the developer side, the CSA states Matter 1.5 lets devs build their cameras with Matter interoperability without causing friction between their apps and services.</p><p>Another important update in Matter 1.5 is support for closures. This includes window shades, drapes, awnings, gates, and garage doors. The CSA states that, with this update, smart home device creators can now "represent" different motion types for their devices, such as sliding, rotating, and opening. Additionally, they can also set configurations, like single/dual panels and nested mechanisms.</p><p>Users with a green thumb are receiving Soil Sensor support for moisture and temperature information for indoor plants and those outside in gardens.</p><h2 id="pushing-on-looking-ahead-2">Pushing on & looking ahead</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1342px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.04%;"><img id="xYH6UX6urKyMTHecqx8vNX" name="matter-bridge.jpg" alt="Matter Bridge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xYH6UX6urKyMTHecqx8vNX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1342" height="1007" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On a related note, the CSA states Matter 1.5 is advancing its energy management capabilities. The update enables devices "to exchange standardized information about energy pricing, tariffs, and grid carbon intensity."</p><p>The Matter 1.5 SDK, testing tools, and more are available for Alliance members. Essentially, it's now just a waiting game for consumers until they begin noticing these new capabilities with their smart home products.</p><p>Around this time last year, the CSA launched <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-upgrade-more-device-support-roll-out">the Matter 1.4 upgrade</a>, which brought in support for more devices like water heaters and heat pumps, and improved thermostat support for preset modes. It was a timely update since we were moving into those colder days, and it also marked the arrival of Device Energy Management for electric vehicles. Several months later, in May 2025, the CSA introduced the "minor" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/matter-1-4-1-minor-release-smart-home-setup-easy">Matter 1.4.1 update</a>.</p><p>This update was all about improving the setup process for the consumer through Multi-Device Setup QR Codes and Onboarding Info in NFC tags.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The design itself is nearly identical to Bose headsets, but because this is ultimately a Baseus product, you don't have to pay anywhere as much. The XH1 retails for $149, and it is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XH1-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0FLPYQ693">now down to $99 on Amazon</a>, making it an even better value.

Other than that, the XH1 doesn't really miss a beat; the headset has a stylish design and is comfortable even with all-day use, the battery easily lasts 50 hours — much more than Bose and Sony — and it's even available in interesting color variants.</p><p>It's the sound quality where the XH1 stands out the most; the headset has thoroughly engaging bass, along with a clean mid-range and decent treble. While I wouldn't say it sounds as good as my Bose QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 headset, it comes mighty close, and that alone is a big deal considering the XH1 costs just one-fourth as much.</p><p>The battery life is phenomenal, and it lasts longer than any other headset I own. It doesn't get dust and water resistance, so in that sense, it is similar to other Bose headsets. However, when you consider the cost — <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XH1-Cancelling-Headphones/dp/B0FLPYQ693">particularly at $99</a> — and the build quality along with the design and terrific sound, there's no question that you're getting one of the best headsets in this category.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you upload a picture with Google’s hidden SynthID watermark, Gemini will spot it and let you know it’s AI-generated, as per the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-image-verification-gemini-app/" target="_blank">announcement</a>. It’s a faster version of the browser-based SynthID Detector Google launched earlier this year, which required manual uploads.</p><p>Google has been embedding invisible watermarks into images produced by its AI models, including the recently added Nano Banana Pro model used inside Gemini, Google Ads, and Vertex AI. These <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tech-talk-what-are-content-credentials">images also carry C2PA metadata</a>, an industry-backed format that reveals how a piece of media was created or altered. With these two layers, Google wants to make AI content easier to trace as it moves across the web, especially when it gets reposted, remixed, or wrapped in misleading narratives.</p><p>Building SynthID directly into the Gemini app is Google’s attempt to bring this provenance data out of the developer world and into something regular people might actually when browsing the web.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:653px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:78.87%;"><img id="TPhnUGsPS3HitkybQFcrU7" name="Gemini-AI-detector" alt="AI image detector in Google Gemini" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TPhnUGsPS3HitkybQFcrU7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="653" height="515" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-critical-limitation-2">A critical limitation</h2><p>However, it’s important to remember that this system only works if everyone uses it. Right now, Gemini can’t spot AI images made by other companies’ tools.</p><p>So, while this update is useful, it isn’t a complete solution. It makes it easier to check images made with Google’s tools and encourages more transparency in the industry, but it doesn’t replace basic skepticism when you encounter a picture that looks a little too convenient. For this system to truly work, other platforms also need to use the same standards and make detection as easy as posting a photo online.</p><p>Google says it plans to expand detection to search results, audio, and video next, but the bigger leap will come when these tools work across the entire internet, not just inside a single company’s garden.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Although it isn't a consideration, the Amp Ultra has a gorgeous design, and it connects to all major streaming platforms. <br></p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if:</strong> You need AirPlay. I don't know why the Amp Ultra doesn't have it, and it is an annoying omission.</p><p>The Amp Ultra has an all-metal chassis with an industrial design that looks great, and the amp stands out for all the right reasons. I use the 3.5-inch panel all the time, and there's a large multifunction rotary knob. The bundled remote is pretty great too, and from a design point of view, WiiM hasn't put a foot wrong.</p><p>Coming to the audio, the Amp Ultra delivers 100W on each channel at 8Ω, going up to200W at 4Ω. I didn't have any issues driving the Wharfedale Linton with the amp, and the ESS 9039Q2M Sabre DAC ensures you get great sound. What I like is that there's built-in integration with all music streaming platforms, and it has room correction that makes a difference.</p><p>You get multi-room sound as well if that's of interest, and WiiM's mobile app has a minimalist interface with plenty of customizability. The Amp Ultra is basically one of my favorite home audio devices, and if you've been waiting on a deal, now is the time to act while it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/WiiM-Streaming-Amplifier-ES9039Q2M-Touchscreen/dp/B0F995W2NG">still available for just $423</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With Amazon's Black Friday sale in full swing, you can score <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D8WJYSF9" target="_blank"><strong>25% off the price of the Google TV Streamer 4K</strong></a>, meaning buyers can get high-quality, Google-backed 4K TV streaming for just $75.</p><p>The Google TV Streamer comes with a sleek, minimal design that offers a welcome improvement from the previous Chromecast device.

As the buds don't nuzzle into your ear canal, you don't feel any pressure while wearing these at all, and they're great for all-day use. On that note, the battery life is terrific, lasting up to nine hours between charges. They're just as good in daily use as working out.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You want noise isolation. Because of the design, you don't quite get the same level of noise isolation — these buds are meant to filter in sounds from your immediate vicinity. They don't have AptX codecs, so you miss out on high-res audio.</p><p>I mostly wear open earbuds these days, as they're just much more comfortable. The clip-on style of the OpenDots One means they do stand out quite a bit, but the upside is that you get a good fit that doesn't cause any pressure even with all-day use. The buds are light, and as they're positioned outside the ear canal, you can make out ambient sounds to an extent.</p><p>Other than noise isolation not being on the same level as the equivalent Bose and Sony earbuds, I don't have any issues with the OpenDots One. The fit is great, the sound quality is astonishingly good thanks to dual audio drivers — it's much better than I imagined — and they have a pronounced low-end that just adds to the vibrancy of the sound. You can also easily tweak the audio to your tastes, and there's no sound leakage, so you won't be disturbing anyone if you blast heavy metal during your commute.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hEaawGLBk9xC9nK5xZT4Hc" name="Shokz OpenDots One" alt="Shokz OpenDots One on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEaawGLBk9xC9nK5xZT4Hc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Oh, and did I mention they're light? The buds weigh just 6.5g, and most of the time, I didn't even notice I was wearing these. While I was initially hesitant about the fit, I didn't have any issues in this area — they stay put even while running or working out in general. You get IP54 dust and water resistance, and they're ideally suited for workouts. While you don't get the best noise isolation, I actually found it to be a good thing; I wouldn't take these on a flight, but for every other situation, they're pretty great.</p><p>The buds are interchangeable, so you can wear these on either ear, and they connect via Bluetooth 5.4. I didn't see any issues pairing the buds with my Pixel 10 Pro and Find X9 Pro, and they connect to two devices at once. The case itself is easily pocketable, and it gets Qi charging as well in addition to USB-C. The only omission is AptX; you're limited to SBC and AAC, so you miss out on high-res audio.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex;

much better than most regular buds. There's fast charging as well, giving you two hours of music playback with a 10-minute charge, and the case provides 30 hours worth of power — so you'll only need to charge the case once a week (that's what I did).</p><p>To sum up, the OpenDots One have been nothing short of wonderful. The comfortable fit is the main reason I like these so much, but that doesn't take away from the great sound quality either. I like the battery life and IP54 ingress protection as well, and on the whole, these are among the best open earbuds I used until now. The fact that they're on sale at $139 makes the earbuds a much more enticing choice.</p> ]]></dc:content>

But if you don't need a full-size controller and are looking to play games on the go, the X5 Lite is a better choice. It is considerably smaller and lighter than the G8 Plus, and as it connects over USB-C, you don't need to worry about the battery running out.</p><p>The controller usually costs $35, which is pretty great in its own right. But now, you can <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joystick-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller-Smartphone/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">get it for just $27 on Amazon</a>, making it one of the most affordable mobile gaming controllers you can buy today.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="46f2bcd2-3325-438b-9b20-5a8c6b009a04" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The X5 Lite is the obvious choice if you just need a reliable mobile gaming controller you can take anywhere.

The X5 Lite has good build quality, great buttons and triggers, anti-drift joysticks, and is generally a great bargain.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a Bluetooth gaming controller.</p><p>The X5 Lite comes in at just 135g, making it a great choice as a portable gaming controller. Connecting over USB-C means there's no problem pairing it with just about any Android phone, and I used it with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Find X9 Pro</a> without any issues. Where the controller has an edge over its costlier siblings is that it easily accommodates phones with huge camera islands, and this in itself made me want to use the X5 Lite more.</p><p>It also has an extending bridge that lets you slot in phones and tablets with ease, and the build quality is terrific — I didn't see any problems after three months of use. Interestingly, the controller gets USB-C passthrough charging as well, so you can easily charge your phone while using it. As it connects over USB-C, you can use it with newer iPhones and iPads in addition to Android tablets, and there isn't anything to configure as such.</p><p>Coming to the buttons, you get the standard ABXY cluster along with a D pad, hall effect joysticks, and shoulder-mounted triggers, and the buttons have good tactility. The joysticks are easily the best of any mobile controller in this category, and while it is on the smaller side, it isn't uncomfortable to hold in the least — GameSir did a good job in this regard.</p><p>Overall, the X5 Lite is a hassle-free mobile gaming controller that excels at the basics. It misses out on some of the extras you get with the X5s or the G8 models, but the fact that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Controller-Joystick-Lightweight-Ergonomic-Controller-Smartphone/dp/B0DXPMVCWC">it costs just $27</a> makes it an unbeatable value.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The Pixel Watch 3 is one such device, and though it may be last year's model, this is still one of our favorite smartwatches and one that I personally use on a daily basis. Lucky for you, this great smartwatch is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH">discounted back down to its lowest price</a>, making it one of the more exciting deals I've seen so far.</p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Pixel Watch 3</a> normally retails for $299 for the 45mm Wi-Fi variant, a price that has already dropped from its original $399 launch price. Now, Amazon has discounted it even further, meaning you can score a Pixel Watch 3 for as low as $199.99, or spend a little more on the smaller 41mm Pixel Watch 3, which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9138ZXM">discounted to just $208.99</a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="eCxonXXh5ZfjYAADW7vfAK" name="google-pixel-watch-3-41mm-official-render-active-obsidian-side.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eCxonXXh5ZfjYAADW7vfAK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="500" height="500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p>Right now, you can save a whopping $100 on the already discounted Piel Watch 3, meaning you pay just $199 for one of the best smartwatches on the market. This is the lowest price we've seen for the Pixel Watch 3, so don't wait to snag this deal!</p><p><strong>Price check:</strong> <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/google-pixel-watch-3-45mm-smartwatch-with-obsidian-band-wi-fi-matte-black-2024/J39TC87JGQ" data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99"><strong>$199 at Best Buy</strong></a> <strong>| </strong><a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_watch_3"><strong>$199 at Google</strong></a><a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D91268TH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="3a50d120-e81b-4fe7-b554-7b7afff3eb41" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension48="$199 at Best Buy" data-dimension25="$199.99">View Deal</a></p></div><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><em><strong>Amazon's Black Friday week is LIVE: see the full list of deals</strong></em></a></li></ul><p><strong>✅Recommended if: </strong>you want a good Android smartwatch with decent battery life, access to apps like Spotify and Gemini, and connect to Fitbit for comprehensive health and fitness guidance.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>you prefer to have the latest and greatest devices, as the Pixel Watch 3 is a year old and uses an even older chipset. Also if you're more serious about fitness, in which case, a Garmin watch may better suit your needs.</p><p>The Pixel Watch 3 may be a year old, but that doesn't make it an outdated watch. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/qualcomm-snapdragon-w5-platform-announcement">Snapdragon W5 Gen 1</a> chipset that powers it still performs admirably, and you won't notice any hiccups. Additionally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-major-wear-os-6-upgrade-rolls-out-for-the-pixel-watch-3-2">Wear OS</a> has come a long way, and it feels like a mature smartwatch OS with well-optimized apps and experiences, like the ability to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/how-change-google-pixel-watch-theme">add and change themes</a> based on your watch face.</p><p>I've owned the Pixel Watch 3 for some time now, and while the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4-review">Pixel Watch 4</a> is technically a better watch with a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/snapdragon-w5-gen-2-revealed-with-satellite-sos-but-no-major-power-boost">newer chipset</a> and AI features you won't currently find on its predecessor, I've never felt the desire to upgrade to Google's latest. Battery life has consistently been pretty great for me, with the Pixel Watch 3 lasting two or more days on average, including tilt-to-wake, sleep tracking, and daily workout tracking.</p><p>If you can manage a larger watch, go for the 45mm variant, as the battery will be better than the 41mm version. I would also suggest opting for a Wi-Fi model; I have LTE, but I find that I rarely use it, and it's just a waste of money on my monthly phone bill.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-17">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This <em>isn't</em> one of those times. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/samsung-galaxy-watch7-aluminum-smartwatch-40mm-bt-cream-2024/J3ZYG2KQ89"><strong>Galaxy Watch 7 has dipped to $129 (48% off)</strong></a>, its lowest price ever by $20, and there's no reason to assume that price will fall lower. This is an everything-must-go sale, and the only question is how long the stock will last.</p><p>Having covered Galaxy Watch deals in Black Fridays past, I remember Samsung followed this pattern with the Galaxy Watch 6, dropping the price by 50% down to $139 before Black Friday and sticking to it through Cyber Monday. After that, Samsung took it off storefronts, and you could only find "renewed" models.</p><p>You can play chicken with Samsung and hope the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-7-review">Galaxy Watch 7</a> falls even further, but I wouldn't risk it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Wellness-Manufacturer/dp/B0D1YNVD88">Amazon's storefront</a> already says "Deal selling fast," which shows that people know this is a steal of a deal.

As the name implies, this updated version of Nano Banana was built off the Gemini 3 Pro model with aspirations of bringing two major upgrades to users and their generated images. To begin, Google says Nano Banana Pro is now more proficient at "generating context-rich visuals."</p><p>The purpose of such images is for users who are creating photos meant to offer information—accurately—for a wider audience. Google states that diagrams and "content-rich" infographics based on images you've given the AI should be more helpful than before. Moreover, facts that you've personally provided to the AI for it to consider and implement are now enhanced.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro is now capable of piggybacking off Google Search. If you're looking to showcase a recipe with hunger-inducing visuals, Nano Banana Pro can grab those recipe details and photos and put them together.</p><p>The second update involves images with text. Google says it has worked to improve the legibility of text in photos generated by Nano Banana Pro. Now, AI-created photos with text using a variety of calligraphy, textures, and fonts should appear clearer, as well as the added ability for users to generate text in multiple languages.</p><h2 id="go-bananas-like-a-pro-2">Go bananas like a Pro</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UQsJIo46ZR8" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Of course, what Nano Banana got popular for was being an image generator, and that's what Google is also upgrading. This new Pro version is said to have upgraded its "consistency by design," meaning the AI can now blend/merge images more consistently. Users can lean on more images (up to 14) and watch the AI merge them in ways you'd like. Elsewhere, new "creative controls" are coming in to help users alter the angle of the generated photo, alter its focus, and more.</p><p>So, while Nano Banana Pro takes the more refined, complex approach to image generation, Google says the original Nano Banana is still there for quicker, generated fun.</p><p>Nano Banana Pro is rolling out today (Nov 20) in the Gemini app for consumers and students.

However, the AI scholar and trailblazer that led the company's research efforts for over a decade is now leaving Meta to create a new startup. Yann LeCun, Meta's vice president and chief AI scientist, will depart to build a company aiming to "bring about the next revolution in AI."</p><p>The company continues LeCun's research on Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI), which he has studied as part of Meta's FAIR research devision and at New York University as a professor. LeCun will remain at Meta until the end of this year, and says more details about the new company will be shared later. Critically, we do know that Meta will partner with LeCun's new company "because of their continued interest and support."</p><p>LeCun confirmed his upcoming departure in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.threads.com/@yannlecun/post/DRQL7I2jlco?xmt=AQF0sZXdrCADKkSp3bU1SIZCLME_gTCUbXRPam80ZebSAw" target="_blank">post on Threads</a> and other social platforms Wednesday, Nov. 19.</p><div><blockquote><p>I am creating a startup company to continue the Advanced Machine Intelligence research program (AMI) I have been pursuing over the last several years with colleagues at FAIR, at NYU, and beyond. The goal of the startup is to bring about the next big revolution in AI: systems that understand the physical world, have persistent memory, can reason, and can plan complex action sequences.</p><p>Yann LeCun, chief AI scientist at Meta </p></blockquote></div><p>Most consumer AI products currently available are large language models (LLM), which have a sizable knowledge base from written text and other works. However, LLMs struggle to stay current or provide a deep understanding of the world. With LeCun's AMI program, the researcher aims to build world models that deliver reasoning, knowledge, and capabilities that come close to or match that of the human mind.</p><p>"As I envision it, AMI will have far-ranging applications in many sectors of the economy, some of which overlap with Meta’s commercial interests, but many of which do not," LeCun writes. "Pursuing the goal of AMI in an independent entity is a way to maximize its broad impact."</p><p>The shakeup will put Meta's FAIR research division in new hands for the first time since its inception. It comes at a time when Meta is acquiring AI talent and companies to compete with the likes of Google, OpenAI, and others.</p><p>"The impact of FAIR on the company, on the field of AI, on the tech community, and on the wider world has been spectacular," LeCun says. "The creation of FAIR is my proudest non-technical accomplishment."</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's enough to give you a decent charge when you need it, though you shouldn't expect this to fully replenish your battery.</p><p>That's because wireless charging is relatively inefficient, so the power bank will usually die before it can fully top up the Pixel 10's 4,970mAh battery. However, it should still be enough for most people, especially when used as a backup. Furthermore, the charger will get a bit warm when in use, but not worryingly so.</p><p><strong>Wireless charging:</strong></p><ul><li>Pixel 10 reaches 1-50% charge in 2 hours, 45 minutes.</li><li>Pixel 10 achieves a final battery percentage of 59% once the Anker power bank is depleted.</li></ul><p><strong>Wired charging:</strong></p><ul><li>Pixel 10 reaches 1-50% charge in 59 minutes.</li><li>Pixel 10 achieves a final battery percentage of 65% once the Anker power bank is depleted.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, you can use the USB-C port for power output, with a maximum of 20W. While not the fastest, it should prove faster and more efficient than wireless charging, as shown in the examples above.</p><p>It also supports 20W charging going in, which isn't too bad, but it means you're waiting nearly two hours for a full charge.

With other power banks, I'm used to having a capacity of at least 10,000mAh, which will provide me at least a full charge and then some. With the growing battery capacities of the best Android phones, I can't expect a full charge from the Anker MagGo Power Bank (5K), though I still find it useful for extra power when I need it.</p><p>The charging speed also leaves much to be desired, but it's not terribly slow, especially if you opt for the USB-C method (which somewhat defeats the point of having a magnetic portable charger).</p><p>To remedy this, Anker offers a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D7DKJ75M/" target="_blank">10,000mAh version of the MagGo Power Bank</a> that not only doubles the capacity but also supports up to 30W charging via USB-C, in addition to 15W wireless charging. That said, at .58 inches, the charger is <em>much </em>thicker and doesn't feel like something I would want to stick on the back of my phone.</p><p>Still, it's an option for anyone wanting to get a little more out of their portable MagSafe charger, and there's even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CFDPQXN4/">another 10,000mAh model</a> with the same capacity and a small display on the side (although it's even thicker at .78 inches).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4129px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="nKjJXDop25VMd94riavSL6" name="Anker-MagGo-Power-Bank-5K-hands-on-03" alt="The Anker MagGo Power Bank 5K being charged by the Anker Nano Power Bank" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nKjJXDop25VMd94riavSL6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4129" height="2322" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, if you're willing to forgo the convenience of a magnetic connection, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/anker-nano-power-bank-a1638-hands-on">Anker Nano Power Bank</a> has served me well and has become my new favorite portable charger.

Once this arrives, when tapping Quick Share to send a file to another phone, users with a Pixel 10 should begin to pick up iPhones. This new capability is said to work vice versa, as well.</p><p>Though these are different (even competitive) devices on different operating systems, Google said it built this capability "with security at its core."</p><p>The company states it has tested its "strong safeguards" with "independent security experts" to ensure that the data you're sending between devices remains protected. It's worth mentioning that so long as your Android device and iPhone <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9286773">are prepared to receive files from others</a>, this Quick Share/AirDrop update will work seamlessly. Moreover, Google says this won't stay a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> exclusive ability.</p><p>The post states that the company will look to improve how Quick Share and AirDrop function alongside one another, as well as looking to offer this update to "more Android devices." There's no timeline set for this just yet, so it's unclear how long other phones will be waiting.</p><h2 id="android-ios-look-like-the-best-of-friends-2">Android & iOS look like the best of friends</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:860px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:69.77%;"><img id="iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY" name="google-apple-quick-share-airdrop-update" alt="Google's Pixel 10 series can now use Quick Share to send files to users with an iPhone's AirDrop." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iZ68brKgxQroxsmXkCRQPY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="860" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This update should begin rolling out today (Nov 20) for the devices involved, so keep your eyes peeled for it.</p><p>This is, in essence, a major update for how Android and iOS (Google and Apple) work with one another, following the whole RCS situation. Last September, Apple started rolling out RCS on its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/apple-ios-18-adds-rcs-support-android">iPhones through iOS 18</a>. This update finally brought read receipts, sharper photos, and an overall well-improved chatting experience between iPhones and Android devices that previously leveraged the old, clunky SMS standard. This was everything Google was fighting for in its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-get-the-message-campaign">#GetTheMessage campaign</a>, even if it had <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/rcs-iphone-launch-had-nothing-to-do-with-google">nothing to do with its implementation</a> in the end.</p><p>However, it <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/apple-gsma-rcs-encryption-standrd-update-confirmed">wasn't until earlier this year</a> that iPhones got the E2EE (end-to-end encryption) side of that RCS update, which is really what we're all here for. The GSM Association announced the new RCS Universal Profile 3.0, which brought encryption to RCS. Why this might seem strange (since Google Messages has encryption), RCS never had encryption levels like that. Google was the one that implemented it for users. Now, with the RCS standard as a whole adopting stronger protections for user messages, everyone can get in on it, including Apple's iPhones.</p> ]]></dc:content>

From heavy-hitters like the recently released <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/vr-games/marvels-deadpool-vr-hands-on">Deadpool VR</a> to the return of classics like Thief VR, there's no shortage of games to play on your Meta Quest this holiday season. But one stands out from the rest for me because of its polish and near-perfect gameplay execution: Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked.</p><p>This long title, which I'll just shorten to Demeo x D&D from here on out, builds upon the successful turn-based strategy card battler <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/demeo-hands-on">Demeo</a> with the expansive universe of Dungeons & Dragons. While I played it on the Meta Quest 3 the entire time, the game is also available on Steam and PlayStation in both VR and non-VR versions, so you can play with all of your friends, no matter their platform of choice. Yes, that means VR players can play with non-VR players just as Demeo allowed.</p><p>Demeo is out now on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014283/" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/experiences/demeo-x-dungeons-dragons-battlemarked/7239148276178939/" target="_blank">Meta Quest</a> for <strong>$29.99 USD</strong>, an unbelievable value when you consider that the substantially shorter Demeo was $39.99 for the longest time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

Each battle takes place on a "board" composed of movement squares, but each board is lavishly decorated to look like a convincing location rather than a simple board game.</p><p>During a battle, players can choose to carry out two actions per turn. Each player has a hand of cards that contains attacks or items to use, or an action point can be spent moving on the board. If you've played D&D, you'll be immediately familiar with some of the mechanics, although the card-based abilities shake up gameplay in a meaningful way from standard D&D.</p><p>Like D&D, you may randomly come across an encounter or trap that requires you to roll a die to either pass or fail the test. Each of the eight playable classes can specialize in a number of different traits, and each of these traits plays a role in combat, traps, and even dialogue.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-mixed-reality-gameplay" alt="Fighting battles in mixed reality in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8sn4MbQT5hXLXD46TstD5n.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The game features two main campaigns at launch, each of which spans dozens of hours and locations to complete. Players can save and stop at any time, resuming their saved campaign with or without other players. Developer Resolution Games recommends always starting with four characters when playing a campaign, and these characters can be controlled by you or other human players.</p><p>Combat isn't the only thing players can do here, either. During each campaign, players will visit locations like taverns that allow them to chat with NPCs, investigate locations and objects, accept side quests, and more.</p><p>Three "one-shot" campaigns are also included in the launch game, adding even more variety and replayability to the game. The game can be played in VR or on a traditional TV/monitor system setup, giving you freedom to choose how you prefer to play this epic strategy title.</p><h2 id="what-s-different-from-regular-demeo-2">What's different from regular Demeo?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="uZw9c3bkS949eyJBJuWrLJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-ui-flat-vs-vr" alt="The differences in the UI between the VR and non-VR versions of Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uZw9c3bkS949eyJBJuWrLJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The base battle gameplay is similar to Demeo in that each character on the board takes turns moving and attacking, with players utilizing abilities from a deck of cards in their hand. But the basic structure of the rest of these games is quite different.</p><p>In Demeo, players choose from a half-dozen campaigns to play through. Each campaign is made up of three "floors." The first floor is usually a medium-sized area, the second floor is typically a much larger area with more challenging groups of enemies, and the third floor is a boss battle. Players stop at "Cleepto's Bazaar" between each floor to shop and trade cards with the merchant NPC.</p><p>In Demeo x D&D, players always begin at a map of the campaign's world and choose areas to visit from there. Each area is bespoke and has no set size. Some sidequests may be made up of a single forested area with a handful of enemies, while other sidequests may be multi-floor dungeons with dozens of enemies. You'll also come across plenty of areas where fighting is not an option, allowing you to move freely around to investigate areas or talk to NPCs.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:426px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="zSG5W79XqSXZLginCWZshm" name="demeo-x-d-and-d-map" alt="Choosing a location to visit on the world map in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zSG5W79XqSXZLginCWZshm.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="426" height="240" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Demeo x D&D has a much more traditional RPG structure in this respect. You can follow the main campaign or get sidetracked as often as you'd like, exploring each of the game's diorama-sized areas to your heart's content. Cleepto's Bazaar still exists in Demeo X D&D, but now it's a dedicated part of the world that you can visit any time you head back to the world map.</p><p>The game saves <em>very</em> often, making it easy to pick up and play. One of the best additions to the original Demeo was a later update that added save slots, allowing you to stop and save, then pick up the action at a later time. Demeo x D&D supercharges this mechanic by dropping a save slot on each player's system, allowing them to continue the campaign you were playing together on their own or with completely different people.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="CZ3oUk2DxBWxJqB3HhcGJJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-random-trap" alt="Encountering a random trap during a battle in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CZ3oUk2DxBWxJqB3HhcGJJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a brilliant mechanic that gives you the freedom to play when you want instead of having to perform a miracle and get all four players' adult schedules lined up. Public multiplayer lobbies are available just as they were in the original Demeo, and I'm hoping the crowd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/how-did-demeo-avoid-the-toxic-culture-of-so-many-multiplayer-games">is just as friendly</a>.</p><p>And unlike Demeo, the characters in Demeo x D&D are customizable. You can paint colors on them in a basic way, and each character has a skill tree that you'll build out as you progress through the campaigns. As you might hope, those skills transfer between campaigns and can make things much easier as you go. One-shot campaigns use new characters each time, which is typical of D&D.</p><h2 id="how-about-a-local-demeo-x-d-d-night-2">How about a local Demeo x D&D night?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="u8CKsekihTrZ2noFhq8fK9" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-official-screenshot-02" alt="Official gameplay screenshots from the non-VR version of Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/u8CKsekihTrZ2noFhq8fK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Resolution Games)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the <em>very</em> coolest features of Demeo x D&D is the ability to play the game together with other people in the same room. Using the built-in co-location feature, Meta Quest players <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-played-virtual-dandd-on-a-real-table-with-the-quest-pro-and-it-was-amazing">can place the board on a real table</a> as if it were a real board game. Everyone sees the same board in the same exact location, so this works as you'd expect (or even just hope to expect).</p><p>I recommend players use only a Meta Quest 3 or Quest 3S for this, as the color passthrough is a significant upgrade over the nasty, low-res, black-and-white passthrough of the Quest 2. This will make it feel like a "proper" D&D night with friends, albeit with no one having to take the helm of dungeon master.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ax95NEsigzBFeKHjAwmDKJ" name="demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-screenshot-conversation" alt="A conversation roll opportunity in Demeo X Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked for the Meta Quest 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ax95NEsigzBFeKHjAwmDKJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And that's another area where Demeo x D&D shines. It features several of the stat-based random encounters of D&D, including environmental hazards and enemies alike, plus lots of dialog choices that players can all vote on. It's an incredible way to get that D&D feel without having to put in all the dungeon master work (and that crap is <em>a lot</em> of work).</p><p>All of these new additions and the fact that there are two full campaigns, plus three "one-shot" campaigns, add significant variety to an already impressive game. I also love that this still uses the tried-and-true Demeo style of combat and movement, which helps it feel different from traditional D&D, all while still maintaining enough of that property's soul to feel like the branding belongs here.</p><p>The polish on the visuals, dialogue, voice acting, and gameplay all combine to make this my favorite VR game of the year. Of course, if you're not a VR gamer or have friends who might be interested in playing the game (but don't have a VR headset), don't worry, as Resolution Games ensured cross-platform play works perfectly. I played with some friends using the non-VR Steam client, and things were as smooth as I had hoped. It's a must-have title on the Meta Quest, for sure, and a must-buy game for D&D and strategy gamers, as a whole.</p><h2 id="faq-2">FAQ</h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What platforms is Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked available on?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked is available on Meta Quest, Steam, and PlayStation platforms.

That means Meta Quest gamers can play the same game together with a non-VR Steam player, and even match up with PlayStation players in the same game. Demeo supports up to four players max.</p></article></section><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Does Demeo x Dungeons & Dragons: Battlemarked use the same rules as D&D?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>While Demeo x D&D sports classic Dungeons & Dragons lore and locations, the game's ruleset is based heavily on Demeo and not traditional D&D. Chance encounters, like random monsters, conversations, or traps that require a roll, use familiar 20-sided dice rolls to pass a requirement, but players cannot choose to "do anything they want" in the same way they can in a traditional D&D game.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>If you’ve ever wished you could message a friend directly in YouTube instead of bouncing to WhatsApp or Instagram, you might soon get your wish. YouTube is quietly testing built-in direct messaging, starting in two countries for now.</p><p>After years of pushing users toward public comments and Community posts, the platform is testing a DM revival in Ireland and Poland, though you must be 18 or older to access the feature, as per YouTube's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/18138167?hl=en&msgid=388556429" target="_blank">support page</a>. To get started, tap the notification bell on any long-form video, Short, or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/minimum-streaming-age-youtube-requirement-increases-parents-details">live stream</a>. Then, hit "Invite others to share videos," and you can send an invite to another user. Once the recipient accepts, the conversation kicks off. If they’d rather not, they can decline.</p><p>You can also block or report someone if the chat gets messy. Messages aren’t fully private, though, as YouTube notes that they “may be reviewed” for Community Guidelines issues, so this isn’t aiming to replace your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-text-messaging-apps">favorite messaging apps</a> like WhatsApp or Signal.</p><p>A separate YouTube <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/16650958#zippy=%2Cinvite-others-to-share-content-accept-invites%2Cshare-when-watching-content" target="_blank">support page</a> notes that invite links expire seven days after they're created. So, make sure you've turned on notifications for YouTube to get notified when someone sends you a chat invite in the app.</p><p>You can also just hit the Share button under any video and pick who you want to send it to, or tap “Invite to share on YouTube” if you need to invite them first.</p><h2 id="this-is-youtube-s-second-attempt-2">This is YouTube's second attempt</h2><p>This isn't YouTube's first rodeo with DMs. The platform launched an in-app messaging system between 2017 and 2019 but eventually shut it down, arguing that the platform needed to prioritize public discussion, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/19/youtube-is-testing-a-revival-of-built-in-direct-messages-a-top-feature-request/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> points out. That was before TikTok rewired how people discover and share content and before short-form clips became a core part of social conversation.</p><p>Fast-forward to today, and YouTube clearly doesn’t want to keep losing those share-and-react moments to other apps. For viewers, the immediate benefit is simply less friction. Instead of copying a link, jumping into a separate chat app, and then diving back into YouTube, you’d be able to keep the discussion right where you found the video.</p><p>For creators and brands, this feature could help build small communities, share exclusive content, and encourage more personal interactions without relying on other platforms. However, the privacy trade-off is important, and YouTube’s monitoring policy may affect whether people use or avoid the feature.</p><p>What happens next will depend on how users react in the next few months. YouTube hasn’t promised to launch this feature worldwide; for now, it’s just a trial to see how things go.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Just because I have fancier models now doesn't change the fact that they got me motivated to get faster and lose weight.</p><p>So if you're looking for a reasonably-priced Garmin watch deal that strikes a balance between affordability and usefulness, the Venu 3 or Forerunner 265 are where you should start.</p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-37">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a><br><br><em><strong>More Black Friday coverage</strong></em></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><strong>The best Google Pixel deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><strong>The best Samsung deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><strong>The best Motorola deals of Black Friday</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This is also true of Chromebooks, and Google has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/geforce-now-fast-pass">announced a new partnership</a> with NVIDIA, introducing GeForce NOW Fast Pass.</p><p>With this announcement, Google states that "GeForce NOW Fast Pass allows users to stream over 2000 PC games directly to their Chromebooks." Since GeForce NOW was already available for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>, you might be wondering what the big deal is.</p><p>Well, if you're an existing Free Tier subscriber, you'll likely find yourself stuck waiting for ads before actually being able to jump into a game.

Instead, it can be seen as more of a supplement, as you're limited to "10 hours of gaming per month, with up to five unused hours rolling over." For comparison, both Performance and Ultimate allow for up to 100 hours of monthly playtime, along with an abundance of additional features.</p><p>Google also confirmed that anyone who buys a Chromebook starting today (November 20) will get GeForce NOW Fast Pass for free, for one year.

Storage limitations are just one reason why, and that's provided that you're able to even get more than a game or two running. And while there are a bunch of fantastic games available on the Play Store, it's not quite the same as playing a new AAA title.</p><p>Thankfully, cloud gaming solutions such as GeForce NOW, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/gaming-accessories/backbone-pro-xbox-edition">Xbox Game Pass</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://luna.amazon.com/">Amazon Luna</a> help to fill the gaps.

It showed it off at Google I/O, and apparently, some users on Reddit started <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-auto/gemini-for-android-auto-is-starting-to-replace-google-assistant">seeing signs of the rollout</a> earlier this month.</p><p>Today, the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/android-auto-gemini-tips">officially announced</a> that Android Auto will indeed be Gemini-fied globally (Nov. 20). With Gemini in your car, you'd be able to get more done on your drive to work. This means you can have lengthy conversations with it and also get more complex tasks done. For instance, Gemini can double as your tour guide and local expert, with it fully integrated in Google Maps.</p><p>Gemini will look at reviews to offer business insights, answer common questions, and help users find and navigate to local spots. If you say, "Hey Google, I need your help. I'm suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?"  Or you can then ask follow-up questions about popular dishes, dog-friendliness, or specific item reviews (like ribs).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="YJBtAnCWvEgC84uwAudsuf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:73,cw:1034,ch:582,q:80/YJBtAnCWvEgC84uwAudsuf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Gemini on Android Auto is all about making your drive seamless; it handles the monotonous tasks for you, allowing you to focus on enjoying your drive. Google explains that you don't need to perfectly dictate texts, start over, or manually add your ETA. It can summarize incoming messages and help you reply confidently.</p><p>You can say,  "Oops, I'm stuck in traffic. Can you let Leo know and add my ETA and a sorry emoji?" and "One more thing. Can you also ask if he wants to grab coffee after the game? And please translate the message into Spanish," with its new ability to translate into over 40 languages, without starting over from scratch.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="QDZ8fy2NSGxMypMLGvPFtf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:218,cw:1067,ch:600,q:80/QDZ8fy2NSGxMypMLGvPFtf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Furthermore, with Gemini's integration into almost every other Google app, you will be able to get it to access your Gmail while still on the move. It can be as simple as asking it to summarize your emails or a more complex task like "Okay, I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?"</p><p>Along with all this, Gemini still helps you "check your calendar, capture to-dos and take notes — now in a much more conversational way," Google said in its press release.</p><p>Speaking of taking over while you drive, Gemini on Android Auto will also act as your brainstorming buddy or someone you'd like to rehearse your speech with, by simply saying, "Hey Google, let's chat about the rehearsal dinner at his parents' house, and I'd like to get them a small something. What are some good ideas…"</p><p>Lastly, what's a ride without some jam sessions? Gemini will be able to curate the perfect playlist for your next road trip, or you could also ask it a more open-ended question, like, "It's pouring outside, could you give me a cozy playlist for a rainy drive?"</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:42.86%;"><img id="S6Jet2hRc2uRtvq4nKKjtf" name="Gemini-Android-Auto-Launch" alt="Gemini infiltrates into Android Auto" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:0,l:188,cw:1067,ch:600,q:80/S6Jet2hRc2uRtvq4nKKjtf.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>That said, the new Gemini AI assistant for Android Auto begins rolling out today, supporting 45 languages.

The good news is that you don't have to wait! Our three <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-glasses">highest-rated smart glasses</a> are <em>all</em> on sale a full week before Black Friday officially begins, but how do you choose between them?</p><p>All three pairs of glasses provide you with a massive wearable OLED display in a svelte glasses form factor, allowing you to plug them into your smartphone, Steam Deck, laptop, or several other devices. That gives you a personal, private screen that won't hurt your neck. Whether you're looking for the best image quality, lowest price, or widest range of compatible products, I'm here to help you make the right choice <em>today</em>.</p><h2 id="best-overall-smart-display-glasses-2">Best overall smart display glasses</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP" name="xreal-one-side-angle-lenses-01" alt="A pair of Xreal One smart glasses on a wooden tea tray" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3nxasAyAZkfzTZarDYJVYP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xreal One has been our top choice since it launched earlier this year. My <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/xreal-one-review">Xreal One review</a> will help you understand what makes it the best if you want all the details, but the skinny is that Xreal One glasses come with the industry's first-ever dedicated chipset, allowing it to do things no other pair of glasses can. They're also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F7R96TFC"><strong>down to $399</strong></a>, the lowest price we've seen yet; a full $100 off!</p><p>Paramount to that experience is the ability to "mount" the virtual screen to an imaginary wall in front of you. When you plug Xreal One into any compatible device, the virtual screen in front of you stays in place just as a physical TV or monitor would, so you can move your head or body around normally, and that monitor will stay in place.</p><p>All other smart glasses "pin" the display to your face, which means that even the slightest jitter will make that display jostle and shake, and could give some people sore eyes or motion sickness. Xreal One's powerful chipset keeps this from happening, and the glasses even feature a built-in monitor-like settings menu that lets you fine-tune the image and several other options. Again, something no other pair of smart glasses can do.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="bd6374aa-83a8-4a19-9b76-3d041fe5ce2f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Take $100 off the normal price and enjoy the power of Xreal One with its dedicated, industry-first X1 chipset.

This dock is only guaranteed to work with Viture's glasses, so it's best to pair Luma Pro with them. Plus, since Luma Pro has the best micro-OLED display on any smart display glasses to date, you'll be thrilled with the image quality here.</p><p>Viture also makes a massive ecosystem of products that work with its glasses, from an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/viture-8bitdo-ultimate-mobile-controller">incredible mobile controller</a> that makes your phone display massive, to a crazy <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/VITURE-Multi-screen-Assistant-12GB-256GB/dp/B0DRVPMT4T?th=1">Android-powered wearable neckband computer</a> that natively pairs with your glasses and enables remote PS5 play, plus access to other streaming services and Android games.

Reportedly, the device was featured in an all-glass case (likely a prototype model) during the Honor User Carnival event in China. There was a host of Honor products on display, like the Magic 8 series, but what had everyone chatting was the Robot Phone.</p><p>From the Weibo post, the Robot Phone was shown off in a white color option with its curious camera flipped up. The camera is housed within its camera array on its back, but when flipped up, it breathes new life into the device and its AI capabilities. Design-wise, the Robot Phone is pretty similar to the Magic 8 series, that is, with rounded corners, flat seemingly, and potentially a completely flat display.</p><p>The report on Weibo cites a statement (machine-translated) from Honor's CEO, Jian Li, who said, "A technology company is completely devoid of vitality without a little innovation. ROBOT PHONE is just a new game for mobile phones. In the future, glory in different industries will make users proud."</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://weibo.com/7490159699/Qep9maBNd">user post on Weibo</a> showed off the Robot Phone in a little more detail with close-up shots. We're able to see just how large the gimbal-like camera is, and the space created within the phone for it to slot into. This model, shown in a black option, gives a little more perspective on its thickness. As expected, it seems the phone will be quite thick, especially around that rear camera array, due to the flip-up camera.</p><h2 id="the-start-of-a-new-phone-era-2">The start of a new phone era?</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:690px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:66.67%;"><img id="hFc4wPnJfeSKqRCkefdCUZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-white-option" alt="A snapshot of the Honor Robot Phone in white, which has its gimbal camera flipped upward." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hFc4wPnJfeSKqRCkefdCUZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="690" height="460" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="YthoqAduiGGDEnu3pwyGUZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-black-triple-showcase" alt="Three snapshots of the Honor Robot Phone, showcasing its flip-up gimbal camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YthoqAduiGGDEnu3pwyGUZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:453px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:132.45%;"><img id="MjF9ycArPUdVHNnVdVZeTZ" name="honor-robot-phone-user-carnival-black-side" alt="The Honor Robot Phone in black from the side, showing off its rather thick camera bar to fit the flip-up camera." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MjF9ycArPUdVHNnVdVZeTZ.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="453" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Weibo)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>When Honor revealed its Magic 8 series, the company also teased something new: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-teases-a-curious-ai-driven-robot-phone-with-a-flip-up-camera">the Robot Phone</a>. While no one knew quite what that entailed, the company's main page updated to showcase the device in an AI-generated video. It positioned the phone as a curious device, one that has a flip-up camera that can be attentive and react to what you (the user) see and do. The design is also quite reminiscent of the Apple iPhone 17 Pro, especially with the way its camera bar looks.</p><p>The prelude also delivers a question: "What if a device could exist with the super brain of AI, perceiving the world around you in an instant?"</p><p>It seems as if the device can take photos for you, record videos for you, and so much more, to make creating memories a breeze. Honor even showed the phone assisting a woman with finding a dress she might like for the evening. This is all exciting, and the Robot Phone's appearance overseas was a shock, but that's not all we should expect.</p><p>Honor states that it plans to fully unveil the Robot Phone during MWC Barcelona in 2026.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Furthermore, these smartglasses could be equipped with a built-in camera, and connectivity to a phone is established via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, as the glasses lack their own mobile data capability.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1584px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE" name="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" alt="Live Translate Demo using Android XR smart glasses" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SSGGBLyPvapWjiGkzEYTfE.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1584" height="891" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Android XR glasses prototype was shown off a few months ago at a TED Talk event.

Unlike <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/cases-screen-protectors/best-oneplus-15-cases">OnePlus 15 cases</a> that are limited in availability right now, there are loads of options available when it comes to screen guards. Almost every single pick is reasonably priced, includes multiple pieces, and has no front camera cutout. The camera notch tends to collect dust, so it's always best to get a screen guard without one.</p><p>The best overall option is the Orzero OnePlus 15 3 Pack Screen Protector + 3 Pack Camera Lens Protector. You get an excellent deal for $10, and the brand Orzero has good reviews spanning across the last few years. The OnePlus 15 set features three scratch-proof 9H tempered glass screen protectors with rounded edges. You also get three dark tempered glass camera lens protectors for the camera island.</p><p>If you want to take care of your phone case needs simultaneously, why not get a set that includes it all? The Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is made of a really sturdy material called 600D aramid fiber. Thinborne includes a free tempered glass screen protector with every one of its cases, increasing the value for money. At the end of the day, it's still a very expensive set priced at $70. However, you get super high-quality products in exchange.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the listing, the mid-range phone will now receive one extra year of Samsung software support, taking users up from a promised six years to seven. The publication clocked that Samsung will now support the phone from 2025 to 2032 with its software patches.</p><p>However, it seems Samsung is only willing to extend one aspect of its software support: the security side.</p><p>There's a section in Samsung's product listing that highlights its promised Android OS versions and the number of upgrades consumers can expect for a particular device. For the Galaxy A56, that number hasn't updated and remains at six. So, right now, it seems the model will only receive major Android OS upgrades from 2025 to 2031, meaning that last year is just for anything crucial and new with Samsung's security.</p><p>A user on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/mobile-apps-services/samsung-extending-software-updates-to-some-mid-range-devices/td-p/13644948">Samsung Community forum</a> noticed this, too, citing a post by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammyfans.com/2025/11/13/samsung-extends-7-year-updates-to-many-devices/">Sammy Fans</a> about a few more extensions. It seems Samsung has also quietly extended its support for the Galaxy A36, Galaxy Tab A11, and Galaxy Tab A11 Plus. All of these devices have been reportedly brought up to seven years, which, in a way, mirrors Samsung's flagships.</p><h2 id="making-the-best-of-the-budget-2">Making the best of the budget</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="4rHh2GsxgNSQfbs6n26svi" name="Samsung Galaxy A56" alt="Samsung Galaxy A56 against a colorful background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4rHh2GsxgNSQfbs6n26svi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>U.S. consumers <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-a56-5g-hits-retailers-nationwide-us-debut">were patiently waiting</a> for the next Galaxy A series phone to arrive, especially after the company skipped out on the Galaxy A55 a year prior. The A56 officially arrived in July at retailers nationwide in the U.S. For $499, consumers were treated to a 6.7-inch FHD Plus Super AMOLED display, a trio of cameras, and a 5,000mAh battery.</p><p>The model was a little delayed in getting to the U.S., as the Galaxy A56 originally launched with the A36 and A26 back in March in other markets.</p><p>The mid-range devices also feature Awesome Intelligence, Samsung's first take on its Galaxy AI features, but for mid-range models. Object Eraser, Best Face, and even Google's Circle to Search made their way to these Galaxy A-series phones.</p><p>Regarding the apparent software extension, Samsung is seemingly bringing its mid-range models up to par with its flagships, sans Android OS upgrades. The Galaxy S25 series <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-many-software-updates-will-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-get">has received seven years of promised support</a>, which includes Android OS updates with its typical monthly security patches.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You wouldn't want to mar such a wonderful trait with a bulky phone cover. This is why I highly recommend getting a sleek and lightweight case for your OnePlus 15.</p><p>So many of the best OnePlus 15 cases are from OnePlus itself. However, due to the delay in FCC certification, both the phone and its cases have been delayed. This is why it's really hard to find either product in stock in the U.S. right now. This leaves you with two choices: You can either buy something available right now, or wait patiently until the cover of your choice is released.</p><p>Of the cases available right now, the Thinborne 600D Aramid Fiber Magnetic Case for OnePlus 15 is the best option for your device. It measures only 0.04 inches wide, is made of robust 600D aramid fiber, has strong magnets, and even comes with a tempered glass screen protector. While Thinborne's sleek offering is pretty expensive, it is an all-in-one solution that you can purchase in North America immediately, making it a great pick.</p><p>I also like Nillkin's Super Frosted Shield Pro Magnetic Matte Case because it has a dotted, textured back that is incredibly grippy. The entire case is built well and fits the OnePlus 15 rather snugly. I have used plenty of Nillkin cases before, and they usually last a good while, between two to three years on average.</p><p>Play the long game, and you can get any of the wonderful first-party OnePlus 15 cases listed in this guide. However, be sure to get a cheap in-between case as you wait for the official cases to go on sale. Something like the clear case from Foluu only costs about $7, making it an ideal temporary solution.</p> ]]></dc:content>

That's probably why you're wondering which OnePlus 15 color you should buy. There are three colorways to choose with this iteration, each available in 16GB/512GB as well as 12GB/256GB storage options. This makes it easier to choose a color worry-free.</p><p>All the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-oneplus-phones">best OnePlus phones</a> always come in a black option, along with a few interesting textures.

A phone is such a personal possession. It often reflects who we are as people. Thus, picking a colorway when buying a phone is not always as straightforward.</p><p>I'm in love with the OnePlus 15 in Ultra Violet because it's one of my favorite colors. And if there's one thing about people who love purple, they go all in on that obsession. But my feral attachment to the shade aside, Ultra Violet is the most unique offering with the 15 series. It has a fantastic duochrome hue with a purple and opal mixture. The matte finish somehow subdues and enhances the color shift at the same time, and the shiny purple frame looks luxurious.</p><p>But if you're not big on colorful shades, then the monochrome options like the beige Sand Storm and plain black Infinite Black are probably better suited for you. Scratches and dirt stand out more on lighter colors like Sand Storm, so if you're planning on using the OnePlus 15 without a phone case, I'd suggest opting for Infinite Black to play it safe.</p> ]]></dc:content>
