The report cites an internal memo from Maher Saba, who is the vice president of Meta's Reality Labs Foundation. It reveals that Meta's next-generation pair of mixed-reality glasses will now release in 2027 instead of 2026. Plus, there's reportedly a prototype wearable and a new Quest headset in the works.</p><p>The company originally planned to launch the mixed-reality glasses, code-named "Phoenix," in the second half of 2026. Now, the glasses are positioned for a release in the first half of 2027. The minor delay is intended to give Meta "a lot more breathing room to get the details right," according to a separate memo seen by Business Insider.</p><p>"There's a lot coming in hot with tight bring-up schedules and big changes to our core UX, and we won't compromise on landing a fully polished and reliable experience," wrote Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns, per the report.</p><p>Separately, the memo penned by Saba references a "limited edition" wearable variant code-named "Malibu 2" in 2026. The next Meta Quest headset will also be a "large upgrade" that will "significantly improve unit economics," according to Aul and Cairns.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k" name="meta-quest-3s-apple-iphone-17-pro-max-orange" alt="A Meta Quest 3S headset behind an orange iPhone 17 Pro Max" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ziW89zHd2rsXrWAq7HBM6k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the memos don't reference the situation specifically, it sounds like these delays may be in relation to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-just-stole-two-of-apples-biggest-lead-designers-and-the-implications-for-vr-smart-glasses-and-ai-are-absolutely-enormous">Meta's design leadership change</a> announced this week.

The update initially debuted for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3-review">Nothing Phone 3</a>, and later <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-phone-3a-just-got-android-16-proving-budget-phones-dont-have-to-wait">made its way to older Nothing Phone models</a> by Nov. 28. However, Nothing Phone users have reported bugs with Nothing OS 4, and the launch has been rocky. In fact, it looks like Nothing has paused the Nothing OS 4 rollout entirely as it works to fix some of the update's issues.</p><p>The first sign that Nothing OS 4's rollout may have been halted came on Dec. 1, when a  report from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://techiboy.com/nothing-os-4-0-stable-update-disappears-for-some-users-heres-what-happened/" target="_blank">Techiboy</a> noted that the update appeared to disappear from user devices. Now, a post from <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1pfkgtq/nothing_os_40_rollout_has_been_paused/" target="_blank">u/nikhkin on Reddit</a> claims that the Nothing OS 4 release was indeed paused. The post cites a screenshotted email from Nothing's support team  responding to the customer's inquiry into why their Nothing Phone 3 hadn't received the Android 16 update yet.</p><p>"We have received feedback from the relevant team and we ... regret to inform you we have temporarily halted and removed the current 4.0 rollout and are working on an urgent fix," the screenshotted email, claimed to be from a Nothing support representative, explained. "Thank you for your patience and understanding while we work to deliver a stable update as soon as possible."</p><blockquote class="reddit-card"  ><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech/comments/1pfkgtq/nothing_os_40_rollout_has_been_paused">Nothing OS 4.0 rollout has been paused</a> from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NothingTech">r/NothingTech</a></blockquote><script async src="//embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"></script><p>The support email contains a few grammatical errors, but appears to be authentic and from Nothing support. Android Central reached out to Nothing to confirm the Nothing OS 4 rollout has been paused, but the company did not respond in time for publication. We will update this article when we hear back.</p><p>The email does not mention the specific bug or issue affecting the stable Nothing OS 4 build, but says the company is working on "an urgent fix." Once the patched version passes Nothing's internal testing, it will roll out to users, according to the email. Users who already have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/nothing-phones/nothing-os-4-arrives-for-the-phone-3-with-exclusive-features-refined-glyph-interface-and-more">Nothing OS 4</a> are set to receive a patched version of the update, and the Android 16 rollout will open for users who didn't get a chance to update.</p><p>It's unclear when the patched Nothing OS 4 build will resume rolling out, but we've asked Nothing for clarification.</p> ]]></dc:content>

With a price tag of approximately $2,400, its early hands-on previews hint at a transformative foldable experience ahead.</p><p>Popular <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMiJRAwDNSNzuYeN2uWa0pA">YouTuber Mrwhosetheboss</a> went hands-on with the Galaxy Z TriFold shortly after Samsung revealed it. The video covers everything, including the unboxing, design and build, software experience, internal hardware, and what it's actually like to use the phone.</p><h2 id="a-closer-look-at-samsung-s-new-galaxy-z-trifold-2">A closer look at Samsung's new Galaxy Z TriFold</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qNKKSujit94" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The video starts with a quick unboxing of the trifolding phone. Arun (Mrwhosetheboss) notes that while most modern Samsung phones ship in small boxes, the Galaxy Z TriFold arrives in a much larger box. It's similar to what Samsung did with the first Galaxy Z Fold, using a big box to deliver a more premium first impression.</p><p>Inside the box, you get the Galaxy Z TriFold laid out fully unfolded, a SIM ejector, a USB-C cable, and a slim case made to cover the device's spine for protection when closed. A rare addition is a 45 W charger included in the box, something missing from devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. Given the price, though, this inclusion is expected.</p><p>In terms of first impressions, when folded, the cover screen looks similar to the 6.5-inch outer display of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-and-z-flip-7-your-ultimate-guide">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> with comparable bezels. However, the video notes that the device is quite heavy at 309 g, making it much heavier than the Z Fold 7.</p><p>When fully unfolded, the Galaxy Z TriFold becomes an extremely slim device measuring just 3.9 mm at its thinnest point. Since it uses a U-shaped tri-fold design, both sides fold inward individually toward the center, and the video even shows an animation that appears if you fold it incorrectly.</p><p>Once unfolded, the device offers a big 10.1-inch 16:11 display similar to an Android tablet. Arun notes that this improves app usability and information density compared to current foldables. Apps like Samsung Health, Files, and YouTube take full advantage of the larger canvas with optimized layouts and more visible content.</p><p>Samsung mentioned in its press release that the Galaxy Z TriFold is the first device with standalone Samsung DeX, and the video confirms it completely transforms the phone into a full computing device. It supports resizable windows, multi-app layouts, and a full desktop-style environment.</p><p>All things considered, the Galaxy Z TriFold looks like a promising device based on the video. It costs about $2,400 in Korea and goes on sale starting December 12, 2025. There's no U.S. pricing yet, but the foldable will likely cost slightly more than in Samsung's home market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The feature was <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-qpr-beta-webcam-feature-video-quality">originally added in Android 14 QPR1</a>, but Google Pixel devices are still the only Android phones to support it. By supporting the USB Video Class webcam standard, you can plug in a Pixel to a host device and use the phone's camera as a webcam. Now, this feature works with the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>As spotted by user Nadir92 on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/MishaalRahman/status/1996928794532438194">X (formerly Twitter)</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-phone-as-switch-2-webcam-3622443/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>, the Switch 2's GameChat feature now works with Pixel phones. By connecting a USB-C cable between your Switch 2 and a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phone</a>, you'll be able to use the phone's live camera feed for GameChat.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Now, it works! #GooglePixel #NintendoSwitch2 https://t.co/2mfCEGSuBn<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1996711176126796110">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>Nintendo's new GameChat feature is a key feature addition for the Switch 2, making it possible to play games in an immersive group environment with friends. After connecting a webcam, users can join a group video call and share their screens. This works across games, and is a clever way to play Switch 2 games remotely with others. There's just one problem — the Nintendo Switch 2 doesn't have an onboard camera.</p><p>Nintendo says the Switch 2's GameChat feature supports most USB webcams. The company even sells a first-party camera accessory for $50 specifically designed for Game Chat. However, it's on the larger side, and makes more sense for a home gaming setup than a portable solution.</p><p>That's why a smartphone — a device with multiple cameras and a USB-C port that most people already carry with them — makes perfect sense for GameChat use on the Switch 2. Unfortunately, the Google Pixel USB webcam mode wasn't compatible with GameChat when the Switch 2 launched. Now, that has been resolved, and Pixel phone users have a convenient GameChat webcam they always have nearby.</p><p>It's unclear whether an update from Google or Nintendo made these devices more compatible. Either way, it's a win for Switch 2 owners who also have a Pixel, as they just unlocked a new method for using GameChat.</p> ]]></dc:content>

People come up with lofty, vague plans like "learn a language" or "lose weight." They spend the holidays gorging on rich foods, then hit January tired, bloated, and back at work. Most people make a half-hearted effort for a week, then fall back on old routines by "Quitter's Day."</p><p>In my case, 2025 isn't over, but I've completed (or will complete) 32 of my 40 resolutions for the year. I wish I could have done more; I never got far with my goals for cycling, push-ups, and novel writing. But resolutions aren't some impossible challenge.</p><p>I can help you plan out your New Year's resolutions so that you're set up for success. You can't just buy a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">fitness smartwatch</a> or download a nutrition app and hope an algorithm will bully you into being healthier. You need to plan them for yourself, and do so <em>right now</em>, not on January 1.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-five-ways-to-make-your-new-year-s-resolutions-successful"><span>The five ways to make your New Year's resolutions successful</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:27.86%;"><img id="BGouKxoAd6JPkXLStnztVC" name="new-year-lloyd.png" alt="Android Resolutions" src="https://dev.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGouKxoAd6JPkXLStnztVC.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="560" height="156" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div></figure><h2 id="1-make-resolutions-for-things-you-already-do-2">1.

We have finite time and mental energy outside of our 9-to-5s, and working new things into your schedule means sacrificing other things.</p><p>Before you make ambitious new plans for 2026, start by creating resolutions that <strong>fit within your current, established routine and hobbies</strong>, only slightly different or harder. That way, you're primed for success, and as you log these completed goals, you'll then be motivated to track and try your more <em>challenging</em> resolutions.</p><ul><li>If you read 20 books in 2025, aim to read 25 books this year, or 20 but with five in a new genre.</li><li>If you're a runner, try running more miles, hit a new race PR, do X more track or trail workouts, or go to X running club or race events.</li><li>Cooks and bakers could try one new recipe a month, or side dishes that pair with favorite meals.</li><li>If you commute every day, commit to more books, podcasts, or journaling for at least one leg of the trip.</li></ul><h2 id="2-break-down-resolutions-into-monthly-goals-2">2. Break down resolutions into monthly goals</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1261px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="zECoeAs9wnVbtFacPCTC44" name="New-Years-resolutions-reading-weight-2025" alt="A Google Docs screenshot showing my Reading and Weight resolution goals, split by month and with bronze, silver, gold, and ace levels of success." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zECoeAs9wnVbtFacPCTC44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1261" height="709" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's say you want to walk 10,000 steps a day in 2026, or work out more; how do you keep yourself accountable? It only takes one bad week to fall off your routine, and then you have no reason to keep trying because you've already failed.</p><p>Instead, <strong>break your resolutions down by month</strong>. Split them out so you can <strong>make up for lost ground</strong> if you start to fall short, or <strong>monitor your progress</strong> toward a long-term goal.</p><p>Here's one example: Instead of "Three gym visits per week," make it "twelve times per month." Compensate for missed days by going more often the following week. If you only go six times in January, that's no excuse to stop; you can aim for eight visits in February, then ten in March.</p><p>The <em>eventual</em> goal is to build a consistent routine, but changing your lifestyle is a struggle, and building in for failed days or weeks makes you less likely to give up entirely.</p><ul><li>Want to walk 10,000 steps per day? That means 300,000 steps total, so you'll have to build in days where you walk <em>more</em> than 10,000 steps, like on weekends, to compensate for days you slack off.</li><li>For vaguer goals like "Drink less alcohol," add each night of drinking to your monthly total. By January's end, if you drank 10 times, that's your baseline, with the goal to decrease that number in subsequent months.</li><li>Similarly, if you want to "lose weight," logging your last weigh-in every month lets you see how you're progressing, or if you're backsliding.</li></ul><h2 id="3-give-yourself-stretch-and-backup-goals-2">3.

Some months, I really slacked off, but because I had the lower 6K and 7K targets, I still had motivation to go out near the end of the month instead of giving up entirely. Other months, I kept pushing after hitting the 240K total, because I could hit a higher goal.</p><ul><li>Want to read more? Maybe 5 books per month is your target, but let yourself aim for 2 (bronze) or 3 (silver) for the months where you don't read for three weeks and need <em>some</em> motivation to finish the month strong.</li><li>Want to do gym or HIIT workouts 10 times per month? Your monthly goals could be to hit five workouts (bronze), eight (silver), ten (gold), and twelve (stretch).</li><li>Want to lose weight?

By the time you hit spring, aiming to hit arbitrary goalposts will get boring, and you'll start to slack off if you let yourself. You need to find a <strong>north star</strong>, a <strong>concrete goal</strong> to work toward.</p><p>In my case, I signed up for a marathon, which gave me <em>months</em> of motivation to run or walk on weekdays, even when I was exhausted from work. I knew the alternative was having a horrible time during the race and wasting my flight and hotel money, so I didn't let myself off the hook; I even started hitting my stretch resolutions.</p><p>To go with your monthly self-perfection resolutions, commit to specific events that mesh with those goals and make lifestyle changes fun instead of onerous.</p><ul><li>Want to hit the gym more? Sign up for Spartan Racing or HYROX, competitive events that give you a concrete reason to train specific muscles: beating your fellow athletes.</li><li>Want to cook or bake more recipes?

The model, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro Preview</a>, released widely across the Gemini app, AI Mode in Search, and Google's developer tools. However, the company also previewed a more powerful Gemini 3 Deep Think model that underwent extra safety evaluations before its public release.</p><p>Now, Gemini 3 Deep Think is officially ready for use in the Gemini app. It's rolling out now for Google AI Ultra subscribers, Google announced in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-3-deep-think/" target="_blank">blog post</a> this week. It's the successor to Gemini 2.5 Deep Think, which was previously Google's best AI model for advanced reasoning.</p><p>"This new mode delivers a meaningful improvement in reasoning capabilities, designed to tackle complex math, science and logic problems that challenge even the most advanced state-of-the-art models," Google explains. "It uses advanced parallel reasoning to explore multiple hypotheses simultaneously."</p><p>Gemini 3 Deep Think performs better on top knowledge and reasoning benchmarks than Gemini 3 Pro. In Humanity's Last Exam, Gemini 3 Deep Think scored 41% without tool use. By comparison, the standard Gemini 3 Pro model only reached 37.5% without tools. In the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark, Gemini 3 Deep Think scored 45.1% with code execution in a result that Google calls "unprecedented."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN" name="Gemini-3-Deep-Think-benchmarks.jpg" alt="Gemini 3 Deep Think benchmark graphs." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSyE5JerxU3LxK2f4TmTdN.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In the Gemini app, Gemini 3 Deep Think is labeled as being "experimental."

Antigravity is an agentic integrated development environment (IDE) that puts AI at the center of the coding experience. Unlike other IDEs with AI helpers, Google Antigravity lets coders deploy AI agents that can make changes, run code, and check their work independently.</p><p>Google shared an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/feed/new-antigravity-rate-limits-pro-ultra-subsribers/" target="_blank">update</a> Friday, Dec. 5 about the response to Google Antigravity, calling it "incredible." The company says it's working to meet the demand for Antigravity, and it's changing the platform's rate limits accordingly. There are positive changes for both free and paid users, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-3-pro-googles-new-ai-model-aims-to-redefine-multimodal-understanding">Gemini 3 Pro</a> still powers the Antigravity development platform for everyone.</p><p>Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers now get priority access to Google Antigravity with the "highest, most generous rate limits." The quotas for Antigravity's rate limits will refresh every five hours.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BGvb4Q27rPkydDSTQiL9Vj" name="Google-Antigravity-2" alt="The promotional images and UI elements for Google Antigravity." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGvb4Q27rPkydDSTQiL9Vj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Antigravity now uses a weekly-based rate limit for free users. Google says this change is intended to "minimize hitting rate limits quickly during a project." So, instead of needing to spread out work on a project across multiple hours and days to avoid rate limits, free users have another option. They can use up all of their Antigravity usage in one project quickly, but free users may have to wait for the weekly rate limit to reset to gain more access.</p><p>Google Antigravity usage limits aren't calculated by the number of requests or lines of code written. Instead, the rate limits are based on "work done" by Antigravity's AI agent. This means that basic tasks will use up less of your Antigravity quota than those that require complex reasoning.</p><p>The core experience is remaining the same for both free users and Google AI subscribers. "Regardless of your tier, all users will continue to enjoy Gemini 3 Pro, unlimited tab code completions and access to all product features, such as the Agent Manager and Browser integration," Google confirms.</p><p>The entire Gemini 3 suite is experiencing high user demand, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/high-demand-leads-google-to-cap-gemini-3-pro-and-nano-banana-pro-usage">Google capping Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro usage</a> at the end of November. Now, Google is making similar adjustments for Antigravity. However, instead of slashing rate limits, the company is tweaking them to make Antigravity available as much as possible while keeping up with the demand.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Sure, it wasn't the first Razr smartphone, and the Galaxy Z Flip was already well-established at that point, but it was clear that Motorola was truly onto something.</p><p>Two years later, Motorola seems to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-should-feel-threatened-by-motorola">have a winning strategy with the Razr</a>. The company has leaned heavily on the flip phone as its premium flagship, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-ultra-2025-review">Razr Ultra 2025</a> featuring specs that rival even the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. However, as 2025 comes to a close, I'm becoming increasingly curious about what Motorola may have in store for its 2026 model and how this year's trends may shape the next Razr phone.</p><p>So what can we expect from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-razr-2026">Motorola Razr 2026</a>?

Phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> showcased just what companies are capable of when they put their minds to it, achieving surprisingly thin profiles under 6mm. To me, this is the perfect technological advancement for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-flip-phones">flip phones</a>, which, despite their compact designs, can be quite thick when folded in half.</p><p>While these phones still have notable shortcomings, including smaller batteries and fewer cameras than typical flagships, some companies have somewhat addressed these concerns when launching their thin models. Motorola recently launched the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-edge-70-is-taking-a-shot-at-apple-and-samsung-with-a-massive-battery">Edge 70</a>, which is less than 6mm thin while featuring a much larger 4,800mAh battery than those in Samsung and Apple's phones.</p><p>Sure, there's no telephoto camera, and it features a mid-range <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-launches-snapdragon-7-gen-4">Snapdragon 7-series chipset</a>, but I would much rather have a battery that lasts me through the day than a telephoto camera.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:700px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="4tiQS8knLEkXSjMB8DXBwD" name="Motorola-Edge-70-teaser" alt="green Motorola Edge 70 showing its battery capacity" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4tiQS8knLEkXSjMB8DXBwD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="700" height="394" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola Poland)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Razr Ultra 2025 is rather chonky, measuring 7.29mm and 15.69mm unfolded. But the way I see it, the Edge 70 is the perfect precursor for a thinner Razr Ultra 2026. Samsung already did something similar with the much thinner <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7</a>, measuring 6.5mm unfolded (13.7mm folded), following the launch of the S25 Edge.</p><p>I would love to see Motorola squeeze in a large <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/electric-car-battery-tech-will-supercharge-your-next-smartphone">silicon-carbon battery</a> while slimming the phone down to 6.5mm or less.</p><h2 id="new-colors-and-new-finishes-2">New colors and new finishes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1379px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="FLmVSwovN3Nh6HTfTRuAiM" name="Motorola-Edge-70-pantone-cloud-dancer" alt="The Motorola Edge 70 in Pantone Cloud Dancer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FLmVSwovN3Nh6HTfTRuAiM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1379" height="775" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of my favorite things about the Razr series (and Motorola phones in general) is the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-razr-2025-lineups-textures-are-a-sensory-delight">use of alternate materials and interesting color options</a>. The Razr Ultra 2025 brought vegan leather, wood, and Alcantara into the mix with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/what-motorola-razr-ultra-2025-color-should-you-buy">Pantone hues</a> like Cabaret, Scarab, and Mountain Trail. It's a stark contrast to the hard glass back panels we're used to on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a>, and it really helps Motorola's devices stand out.</p><p>Pantone recently announced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://motorolanews.com/color-of-the-year-2026/">Cloud Dancer</a> as the 2026 color of the year, and Motorola has already launched the Edge 70 featuring the color, with a "leather-inspired back finished in a quilted pattern" and embedded Swarovski crystals.</p><p>There's little doubt in my mind that the next Razr will feature this color, though I hope the company extends the Swarovski partnership to the Razr 2026 Ultra (it was only on the base <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/motorola-brilliant-razr-2025-buds-loop-swarovski-collaboration-shines-launch">Razr 2025</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="2o5rUtxscYWVkQWEXyQVGS" name="motorola-edge-70-ultra-leaked-render" alt="A leaked rendering of the alleged Moto Edge 70 Ultra with a textured, almost fabric-like back panel, a square camera housing, and three lenses." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2o5rUtxscYWVkQWEXyQVGS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've also seen leaks of what appears to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/the-motorola-edge-70-ultra-looks-like-it-wants-to-stand-on-premium-in-this-leak">Motorola Edge 70 Ultra</a>, which reveal a different textured back finish compared to the Razr series.

That said, Motorola's pricing for the Razr series felt a bit off.</p><p>I love the Razr Ultra 2025, but $1,300 feels like too much to spend on a Motorola phone, making it hard to recommend. Fortunately, we saw a few deals during Prime Day and Black Friday that made it much more attainable, but the Razr Ultra 2026 should not cost more than $1,100.</p><p>I would love to see the Razr Ultra 2026 start at $999, although $1,100 would align with Samsung's recent pricing for the Galaxy Z Flip 7. If that means cutting the base storage from 512GB to 256GB, I think that's a compromise most consumers can live with, while <em>opting </em>to pay the exorbitant $1,200 or $1,300 for more storage.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-hands-on-17" alt="Different colors of the Razr Ultra 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Q4uD6JrUXYHyJc2Us5C4se.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Then there's the Razr Plus 2026.

If there is, it should come with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/snapdragon-8-gen-5-announced">Snapdragon 8 Gen 5</a> chipset and other moderately upgraded specs (swap the telephoto camera for an ultrawide), leaving the more premium <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> to the Ultra.

We know you're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/google-promises-new-fitbit-hardware-in-2026-past-statements-suggest-which">launching new Fitbit hardware in 2026</a>, but for my sake, and for the millions of health-conscious consumers who crave simplicity, style, and cutting-edge tracking, please let that hardware be a smart ring.</p><p>The form factor perfectly aligns with Fitbit’s DNA: long battery life, accurate tracking, and simplicity. These are the pillars that made Fitbit a household name. While <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatches</a> have become feature-packed mini-computers, many consumers still crave a device that “just works” without constant charging or complicated interfaces. A ring delivers that promise.</p><p>Unlike a wristband or watch, a ring sits stationary on the finger, offering superior conditions for heart rate and other biometric measurements. Less movement means more accurate readings, a critical differentiator in a market where precision matters. Rings also feel less intrusive, blending seamlessly into daily life. For the simplicity-loving Fitbit user, this is a dream come true.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

That segment is under pressure. As we head into 2026, macroeconomic trends point to a <strong>K-shaped recovery</strong>, where affluent consumers continue to spend while value buyers tighten their belts. Your current lineup caters to the latter, which is a risky bet.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/best-smart-rings">Smart rings</a>, on the other hand, command higher average selling prices (ASP). This is your chance to move Fitbit upstream, reclaim its premium status, and tap into a segment that’s resilient and aspirational. Think of the consumer who wears a luxury watch but still slips on an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oura-ring-4-review">Oura Ring</a> because health matters. Fitbit deserves to be in that conversation.</p><h2 id="market-signals-2">Market signals</h2><p>Consider the numbers: Oura has shipped 5.5 million rings in its lifetime with virtually no serious competition. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-review">Ultrahuman</a>? Roughly 1 million. Samsung? Under 500,000. Meanwhile, Fitbit — despite aging hardware — shipped over 2 million devices in the first three quarters of 2025, according to IDC. At its peak, Fitbit moved tens of millions annually. With Google’s reach, that scale is achievable again — if you let Fitbit stretch its wings.</p><p>And the trend is undeniable. Rings are gaining traction in the U.S. health and fitness tracker market with an ASP of over $200. Just look at the chart below:</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:789px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.64%;"><img id="9mM4rsB8MHWZ3YbewrHupA" name="IDC-US-health-fitness-trackers-market-2023-2025" alt="The US market for health/fitness trackers from Q3  2023 to Q3 2025" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9mM4rsB8MHWZ3YbewrHupA.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="789" height="510" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: IDC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Notice how the orange slice representing rings has grown steadily from 2023 to 2025. This isn’t a fad; it’s a shift.</p><h2 id="corporate-wellness-fitbit-s-secret-weapon-2">Corporate wellness: Fitbit’s secret weapon</h2><p>Fitbit pioneered corporate wellness programs, partnering with insurers and employers to integrate health tracking into benefits packages. Oura has also capitalized on this playbook, but Fitbit wrote it first. A smart ring would supercharge Fitbit’s ability to re-enter this lucrative segment, offering a discreet, stylish device that employees actually want to wear.</p><h2 id="fashion-meets-function-2">Fashion meets function </h2><p>Health tech is no longer just about utility; it’s about identity. Consumers flaunt luxury watches and designer clothes, yet they still seek cutting-edge health insights — that market is currently served by the likes of Oura and Whoop. But a Fitbit ring bridges that gap, elevating the brand into a space where fashion and wellness intersect. Done right, this product could sit comfortably next to a Cartier bracelet or a Rolex watch.</p><h2 id="xr-the-hidden-opportunity-2">XR: The hidden opportunity </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd" name="Android-XR-smart-ring-controls-awe-2025" alt="The author wearing a Kiwear smart ring capable of gesture controls, using it to slice fruit in Fruit Ninja on a tablet." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dgZs7Q8ensYqq49TLTPjgd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The smart ring isn’t just about health; it’s about the future of interaction. With <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/android-xr">Android XR</a> glasses and headsets expected in 2026 and beyond, the ring form factor is perfectly poised to become a discreet, intuitive input method.</p><p>Remember <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/googles-parent-company-reportedly-buying-ar-smart-glasses-maker-north">Focals by North</a>, one of Google’s own acquisitions? They used a ring as a controller, and it was brilliant. Other brands have since replicated this approach, proving its viability. A Fitbit ring could serve double duty: health tracker and XR controller, making it indispensable in Google’s ecosystem.</p><h2 id="why-google-needs-this-win-2">Why Google needs this win </h2><p>Let’s be honest: Google’s hardware ambitions have been uneven. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/best-google-pixel-phones">Pixel phones</a> are gaining traction, but wearables remain a battleground dominated by Apple and Samsung. A Fitbit smart ring isn’t just another SKU — it’s a statement. It says Google understands where the market is headed and is willing to lead, not follow.</p><p>And let's not forget, Valentine’s Day is not far off. What better time to seal the deal with Fitbit fans than by launching a product that symbolizes commitment to health and wellness? A ring isn’t just a device; it’s a statement. Imagine the marketing possibilities: “Show your heart some love.” It practically writes itself.</p><p><strong>About IDC</strong><br>IDC is a leading global provider of technology research, insights, and events.

It's not their responsibility to tell you and me how to raise our kids unless we're doing something wrong enough to break the law.</p><p>The Australian government is caving to the demands of a few loud voices in an attempt to become more popular and boost some politicians' reelection chances. I imagine most parents think the government should let them take the wheel when it comes to raising their kids, rather than telling them that Junior isn't allowed to upload <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-game-review-minecraft-pocket-edition">Minecraft videos</a> once he's finished his homework.</p><p>Google doesn't want anyone — child or not — to have any difficulty having a YouTube account.

According to my year-end review from Google, I use it more than 80% of people do. I've seen plenty of great things, but I've also seen some pure garbage. If you use the service, you can say the same: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/youtube">YouTube</a> is full of content that kids have no business seeing.</p><p>We might disagree on what that content is. For example, I don't care if my kids watched a video with foul language because I know what they hear in school, and that they probably use at least half of those words when I'm not in earshot. I don't like the idea of them learning how to make a homemade pipe bomb, though, because I think most kids are stupid enough to believe they can try it and not get hurt or hurt anyone else, not that they want to become militant terrorists.</p><p>The point is that we each can decide what our kids see and how often they see it if we want to. Letting the government decide what content is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-old-do-you-have-be-open-gmail-account">age-restricted</a> and then blocking access to it is lazy parenting.

While there are stats and features regarding Play Books, Google says that users can expect a gift this weekend: the gift of 15x points. Beginning today (Dec 5) through December 7, users purchasing books can earn 15x the Play Points.</p><p>The company says this boost will apply to all users regardless of their Play Points level.</p><p>Since launching in 2010, Google says Play Books has expanded to over 75 countries and has built a library of "over 10 million ebooks and audiobooks." The company draws attention to its shelves, which helps users organize their books by genre or author. Users are also able to access their Play Books library between devices. Users can quickly pick up their stories from one phone to another (or even a tablet) without a problem.</p><p>Samples in Google Play Books give users a chance to understand the prose or general pacing of a book in question. More than that, the subscription gives users quick alerts when a new title is added to their favorite series.</p><h2 id="happy-birthday-google-play-books-2">Happy Birthday, Google Play Books</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghr9adwnaOE" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google Play Books is back in the spotlight after the Play Store celebrated the year's end with its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-play-store/google-play-celebrates-its-best-of-2025-winners-for-apps-and-games">typical "Best Of" showcase</a>.

It also has a 720p selfie cam and built-in microphones for video meetings or recording, as well as a durable 180-degree hinge for multiple viewing angles.</p><p>While it's not an industry-leading device by any stretch of the imagination, Samsung does highlight that the Go features substantially faster performance as well as a WLAN card that's around three times as fast as previous Galaxy Book generations.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>For a long time, people who wanted direct political coverage had to use free streams and awkward browser tabs to watch congressional hearings, since C-SPAN wasn’t on YouTube TV. That’s changed this week. YouTube TV now includes C-SPAN, C-SPAN2, and C-SPAN3 in its live TV lineup.</p><p>C-SPAN and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/youtube-tv">YouTube TV</a> first struck a deal back in September, agreeing on a modest per-subscriber fee, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/04/youtube-tv-finally-adds-c-span-channels-following-fee-agreement-with-google/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>. This agreement made it possible for the full launch <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/cspan-live-on-youtube-tv/" target="_blank">to happen this week</a>.</p><p>Until now, YouTube TV subscribers had to jump through hoops to watch C-SPAN content, relying on the network’s website or scattered livestreams during major political events. That’s no longer the case. The channels are now in the regular guide with other news outlets, and there’s no need for a special add-on.</p><p>This change is also a lifeline for C-SPAN. As more people dropped cable, the network’s revenue fell from about $64 million in 2019 to $45 million in 2023, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.newsday.com/business/cspan-media-streaming-congress-l22875" target="_blank">Newsday</a> reported. Joining major streaming bundles became necessary for its survival.</p><h2 id="no-extra-cost-for-youtube-tv-subscribers-2">No extra cost for YouTube TV subscribers</h2><p>For YouTube TV, the cost is low enough that subscribers probably won’t see a price increase because of this change. It’s a win-win: C-SPAN reaches millions of homes without cable, and YouTube TV adds a news channel that many people thought it should have had long ago.</p><p>For viewers, this change is straightforward. You get C-SPAN’s full, unfiltered coverage, now with YouTube TV’s playback controls, search features, and the ability to watch on different devices.</p><p>The bigger point is what this means for streaming overall. If a public-affairs network like C-SPAN can finally join major live-TV services, it could lead to more niche or civic-focused channels moving away from cable too. It also raises the bar: if <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-services-free-trial-deals">streaming platforms</a> are going to replace cable, it should offer the same variety, including important coverage of government and democracy.</p><p>For a service that prides itself on being a full cable replacement, this addition brings it closer than ever to actually feeling like one.</p> ]]></dc:content>

A lot of leaks have already revealed plenty about the Galaxy S26 lineup, and it seems Samsung may have accidentally leaked the designs itself.</p><p>Spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-series-designs-software-3622475/">Android Authority</a> in One UI 8.5's source code, there are references to certain renders of Android phones that appear to be the upcoming Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26 Plus, and Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>According to the report, the source code mentions three new Samsung devices with codenames M1, M2, and M3, which correspond to the Galaxy S26 (M1), Galaxy S26 Plus (M2), and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s26-ultra-vs-galaxy-s25-ultra">Galaxy S26 Ultra</a> (M3).</p><h2 id="new-one-ui-code-all-but-confirms-the-s26-design-2">New One UI code all but confirms the S26 design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2610px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:57.55%;"><img id="QxHFGe2VmRYUxaMMRFzWQe" name="galaxy-s26-design-one-ui-8-5-source-code" alt="Leaked designs of the Galaxy S26, S26 Plus, and S26 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QxHFGe2VmRYUxaMMRFzWQe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2610" height="1502" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Authority)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While the images aren't actual 3D CAD renders like the ones we usually see ahead of launch, they are 2D illustrations of the upcoming devices.

The publication speculates that the phone could have a launch quite soon, likely sometime in December, considering its CQC appearance; however, the main highlight is its massive battery capacity.</p><p>Per the listing, the Honor X80 will seemingly hit the Chinese market sporting a huge 10,000mAh battery.</p><p>The post adds that the battery could also sport "increased durability," potentially pushing forward its longevity for users looking to really go the mile with their phone before charging. Strangely, the publication states that "other details" about the phone are missing in the CQC listing. It's not <em>that </em>strange to have some details left in the dark about a phone during its certification rounds. This just means we'll have to wait until the phone appears officially.</p><p>The post states that the listing did mention 5G cellular connectivity—an unsurprising addition. The folks at Gizmochina add that the Honor X80 has been rumored to sport "improved performance" over its previous iteration, the X70. Additionally, consumers may also find even greater strides toward mobile gaming, which could affect its FPS for higher-intensity games, like Genshin Impact or even Zenless Zone Zero.</p><h2 id="honor-s-making-changes-2">Honor's making changes</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT" name="Android-16-logo-purple-Honor-200-06" alt="A purple and green Android 16 logo on an Honor 200 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tz9fdwZDVfiw5ycnJWrCVT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Honor's alleged battery capacity increase for the X80 is roughly 2,000mAh more than what the X70 provided.</p><p>Here's the thing: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/future-honor-android-phones-major-battery-capacity-rumors">rumors about Honor's plans</a> from this past summer claimed something like this <em>could </em>happen. Allegations from July said that Honor was looking at boosting the battery capacity of two phone series: its Magic flagship line and its mid-range X series. These rumors came from tipsters on Weibo (Chinese social media), adding that its mid-range series could see totals between 8,200mAh and 8,400mAh.</p><p>These totals are much lower than what the X80's purported listing dictates, as it's ~1,800mAh higher than those predictions. Nevertheless, an increase could be a reality for those awaiting it in China.</p><p>Those July rumors highlight its flagships, stating totals could rise to a range of 7,020mAh-7,200mAh.</p><p>Those flagship totals were met <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-8-series-debut-redefines-on-device-ai-imaging-on-device-needs">when the Magic 8 Pro debuted</a> in October, as it was revealed to possess a 7,200mAh battery. However, this mid-range Honor X80 isn't the only thing making its rounds, as other rumors have surfaced about an Honor Magic 8 "Ultra."

From the looks of it, the Galaxy Z TriFold is incredibly thin (3.9mm), featuring a large display and two panels that fold inwards.</p><p>The Galaxy Z TriFold showcases a 10-inch AMOLED main screen when unfolded, and a 6.5-inch cover screen. Samsung has made two differently sized hinges that ensure a smoother folding experience, allowing the panels to close without leaving any gaps. It has an IP48 rating, which means it is resistant to freshwater immersion and solid objects.</p><p>It comes with a massive 200MP wide-angle sensor with 2x optical-quality zoom, an ultrawide 12MP camera, and a 10MP telephoto lens. The cover screen features a 10MP selfie camera, while the main screen has a 10MP under-display camera, making it easier to take selfies even when the device is unfolded.</p><p>The device is said to come with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/android-16">Android 16</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/one-ui">One UI</a> 8 out of the box, only in one colorway: Crafted Black, landing in the U.S. only in the first quarter of 2026.</p><h2 id="twas-a-week-of-new-feature-drop-for-pixels-and-android-users-2">'Twas a week of new feature drop for Pixels and Android users</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5712px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R" name="Pixel-10-series-boquet" alt="Pixel 10 series shot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v2/t:769,l:356,cw:5356,ch:3012,q:80/WkEf6GUsy4vTHLJKuUCE3R.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5712" height="4284" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/december-drop-google-brings-fresh-updates-for-android-users"><strong>here </strong></a><strong>and </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-finally-fights-notification-overload-and-lets-you-kill-ugly-icons"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/android/new-android-features-December-2025/" target="_blank">announced</a> that it will introduce new features to help Android users really focus on the things and people that matter most to them when they pick up their phones — cutting out the unnecessary noise.

Samsung is reportedly working on a new smartwatch that is internally called the "Galaxy Watch 9 Ultra," but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-watch-ultra-2/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a> suggests this will hit shelves as the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2. However, the publication also suggests that the new Ultra won’t be released until the summer of 2026, meaning there will be no major rugged update in 2025.</p><p>Samsung appears to have delayed the launch, opting instead to focus on a more substantial upgrade in 2026. This move suggests the company is aiming for more than a mere specification bump, potentially giving the smartwatch a whole new look. We're likely to see a unique feature on the new watch.  If it shares the DNA of the Apple Watch 9, we’re likely to see more advanced health features and greater processing power.</p><h2 id="massive-one-ui-8-5-leak-2">Massive One UI 8.5 leak </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:50.00%;"><img id="e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-review-hero-5" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 in blue on a blue table outdoors." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e2kc6RdzJHPmwiUJVaM78W.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Read more </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/one-ui-8-5-update-changelog-leaked"><strong>here</strong></a></p><p>We've been seeing multiple One UI 8.5 leaks lately, and this is the best one yet.

The Pixel 10 Pro XL is our favorite Android phone for parents, in no small part due to its powerful range of cameras, its large OLED display, and its huge performance improvements over previous generations. It features a wide camera lens, a telephoto, and an ultrawide lens on the rear, as well as a powerful front-facing camera.</p><p>The 10 Pro XL normally retails at $1,200, so keeping an eye out for deals like this is definitely the move. To be sure, this is also the lowest price ever recorded for the phone at Amazon, so it's not a bad pick if you're already in the market for something in the premium price range.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.00" data-dimension48="$1,199.00" href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTPP3S7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-XL-render-Moonstone-front-back" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/APdDaw44aSpsKffhWU53s9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="2500" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-Pixel-Pro-Smartphone-Fast-Charging/dp/B0FFTPP3S7" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$1,199.00" data-dimension48="$1,199.00" data-dimension25=""><del><strong>$1,199.00</strong></del><strong> $849.00 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has chopped $350 off the price of the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, which is our top pick for the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones#section-best-for-parents">best Android phone for parents</a>.

The Google Tensor G5 also offers significant performance improvements over previous generations of the Pixel, making for smoother gaming. While it still doesn't quite hold up to some premium-level, Qualcomm-backed phones, it's still a welcome upgrade and it gets multi-tasking help from the 16GB of RAM.</p><p>As for cameras, this Pixel has a 50MP main lens, a 48MP ultrawide with macro focus, a 48MP telephoto, and a 42MP selfie cam. It also comes with a 5,200mAh battery, 45W wired fast charging, and Qi2 Pixelsnap wireless magnets built in.</p><p>Some of the biggest downsides to the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL are its lack of a SIM card tray in the U.S., some battery throttling, and a PWM rate that isn't suitable for many with sensitive eyes. If these aren't dealbreakers for you, then an $850 price tag is a good opportunity to pick this premium phone up, at the very least.</p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-7">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

The features build on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-now-remembers-your-drivers-license-passport-and-vehicle-info-so-you-dont-have-to">enhanced autofill</a>, the upgraded autofill feature that debuted in November for Chrome users in all regions and languages. Enhanced autofill initially added support for driver's license numbers, passport numbers, license plate numbers, and VINs.</p><p>Now, Google is expanding Chrome's enhanced autofill to support saving vehicle details to Google Wallet. This feature links your vehicle info to Google Wallet after entering it on a supported form in Chrome for desktop, making it available on any device signed into your Google account.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Kn3xAshk8B7jpFrQxx5sFh" name="Chrome-Autofill-Holidays" alt="Chrome's enhanced autofill features being used to book flights and enter vehicle information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Kn3xAshk8B7jpFrQxx5sFh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Chrome is gaining deeper integration with Google Wallet across the board to make securing holiday travel plans easier. The browser can pull information stored in your Wallet, like a confirmation or ticket number from your flight's boarding pass. Additionally, Chrome now has access to loyalty card info stored in Wallet on desktop and the Android app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="zLuWkXTssYDr8vHVwq5kVh" name="Chrome-Autofill-Holiday-2" alt="Chrome's enhanced autofill features being used to book flights and enter vehicle information." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/zLuWkXTssYDr8vHVwq5kVh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Android version of the Chrome app is getting a major upgrade that'll make filling out forms a quicker process. The app is gaining a two-line view for autofill suggestions that make it clearer which autofill data you're entering before you tap it. For example, an address saved in autofill will now show the name and address in a two-line format. The same goes for passwords and payment methods, making it clearer which account or card you're using in the Chrome app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1076px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.63%;"><img id="GdnmErbTfPxDRErtm3brDY" name="image-5" alt="The new autofill form suggestions in Chrome for Android." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GdnmErbTfPxDRErtm3brDY.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1076" height="1072" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google says this new autofill view for forms addresses an issue that made autofill suggestions appear too condensed in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chrome-for-android-just-got-its-long-awaited-dose-of-googles-latest-redesign">Chrome app for Android</a>.</p><p>Chrome will also work more closely with your Google Account to securely retrieve your name and email address as long as you're signed in. This also works for your home and work addresses, if they are saved to your Google Account. While autofill could previously fill these data types, the expanded support is helpful when using new devices. Users only need to sign into their account in Chrome to see all their information appear instantly.</p><p>Finally, for global users, Chrome is improving its understanding of address formats worldwide, like "between streets" in Mexico and phonetic names in Japan.</p><p>These improvements are rolling out now in Chrome for desktop and mobile, and they might just help save you time during the busy holiday season.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The point of these labels is to show where the account originates from. If you've created your X account in the U.S., ideally, your location should say "United States." However, when the feature arrived, users started noticing that their location wasn't accurate at all, which was reportedly a concern by those working at X (formerly Twitter), who "rejected" the idea, per NBC News.</p><p>The publication tapped an X employee who remained anonymous, who stated, "the company had decided against deploying the idea in the past for two reasons: concern about creating a visible target for bad actors to manipulate and fear that the label could backfire."</p><p>VPNs were also thrust into the discussion, as such software is useful for effectively shifting your location, even if you're not from that country, region, etc. The report takes a turn, as users online, involved in the political side of things, have voiced that people they once thought were based in the U.S. have been shown to reside elsewhere. This brings us to the other side of X's battle: a war against misinformation.</p><p>These location labels were also designed to try and help fix that misinformation, giving people the awareness of knowing if the user they've seen posting about American politics is even from the United States. Ellison Barber from NBC News <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/x-new-location-transparency-feature-questions-origins-maga-accounts-rcna245487">held a brief interview</a> with TechRadar's editor-at-large, Lance Ulanoff, about X's location feature.</p><p>To Barber's question about whether or not this could stop X's bot problem "meaningfully" or if it's just a "performative band-aid," Ulanoff states, "I don't think it's going to have much of an impact at all." He adds, "what it's done is started a conversation and sometimes started controversy that may go nowhere."</p><h2 id="it-s-a-constant-struggle-2">It's a constant struggle</h2><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">There are a few rough edges that will be resolved by Tuesday.

At worst, the labels can backfire." Recently, Nikita Bier, head of product at X, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/nikitabier/status/1995990576391749850">reported that the new</a> "About this account" feature had been used "over 360 million times since launch," which likely points toward people who've been genuinely curious about the supposed general location of others.</p><p>The social media platform had reported that it was working to fix its inaccuracy for users, especially for those with pages that say their accounts are from a foreign country, when they aren't.</p><p>This location label feature is probably the most controversial update to hit the app this year. X updated its mobile app in January with a feature that was more light-hearted, and one that took a fight to TikTok, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/x-new-tab-for-vertical-videos">as it gave users a dedicated video tab</a> on the Explore page. The video feed displays, you guessed it, only videos; however, they are roughly a minute long. Either way, users can "endlessly" scroll through this feed, as if they were drowning in Reels.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you tap <strong>Add watch face</strong>, you'll find 27 categories with nearly 150 variations, mostly color differences but also different layouts, such as whether to place widgets along the display edge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="SbmNb5EakEfuAAsrZ39sBA" name="Pixel-Watch-4-and-Watch-3-watch-faces" alt="The Pixel Watch 3 (left) and Pixel Watch 4 (right) sitting on a green pillow.

Stylish as they are, they're also a bit homogenous. If you're looking for more variety, especially for fun holiday- or pop culture-themed watch faces, you're in luck: Wear OS 6 brought back support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/finding-the-best-custom-watch-faces-wear-os-6-facer-watchmaker">3rd-party watch face apps</a> like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeremysteckling.facerrel&hl=en_US">Facer</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=slide.watchFrenzy&hl=en_US">WatchMaker</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apposter.watchmaker&hl=en_US">TIMEFLIK</a>, with hundreds of thousands of custom options. Most require a subscription or purchase, but plenty are free.</p><p>For each app like Facer, you'll need to download it on your phone <em>and</em> watch, then select the Pixel Watch 4 as your primary device. Any watch face you choose will be uploaded to the Watch 4 and given a dedicated slot next to Google's default faces. Choose a new Facer face, and it'll replace your old pick in the same slot; you'll have to save old favorites within the app itself if you want to swap back.</p><p>Also, be warned that Google doesn't pull color themes from custom watch faces, defaulting to a Moonstone theme. Once you choose your new watch face, go to <strong>Settings > Display > Color theme</strong> and select one of the eight generic options that match it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-edit-your-tiles"><span>Edit your Tiles</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="LSG7hN86tERNRvXCLrAVcQ" name="Pixel-Watch-4-edit-Tiles" alt="The Add Tiles view showing the UV Index, YouTube Music, and Contacts Tiles on the Google Pixel Watch 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LSG7hN86tERNRvXCLrAVcQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Wear OS 6 upgraded Tiles to make them more useful than before, with more shortcuts per Tile and (for some) an Edge button that takes you to the full app. Since you can have a maximum of 15 Tiles, take the time to decide which you need.</p><p>On any Tile, <strong>tap and hold</strong> to enter Editing mode, then tap the <strong>left or right arrow</strong> to reorder them so your favorite apps are easier to check first. Tap the <strong>+</strong> icon to <strong>add a new Tile</strong> from the available options, or swipe up on any Tile to remove it from the Carousel.</p><p>Among the available non-default Tiles, I definitely recommend adding the Alarm and Timer tiles for functionality, Google Keep's Create Note tool for quick voice transcriptions, and the Gmail "New Emails" tile.

People who gesticulate while they talk may get too many false positives, while others may find that Gemini fails to listen unless you awkwardly yank up your arm.</p><p>Open <strong>Settings > Gestures > Raise to Talk</strong> and toggle it <strong>On</strong> if it isn't already. Then, scroll down to find <strong>Gesture sensitivity</strong> and <strong>Voice sensitivity</strong> options. I chose to make mine more sensitive, so it registers commands with more casual arm movement and without me having to speak as loudly or quickly.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-limit-annoying-notifications-and-sync-bedtime-mode"><span>Limit annoying notifications and sync Bedtime Mode</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="M4hZvrVHtkXfypV5aiupfQ" name="Pixel-Watch-4-bedtime-mode" alt=""Starting Bedtime Mode" visible on the Google Pixel Watch 4." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/M4hZvrVHtkXfypV5aiupfQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>By default, your phone and watch will buzz at the same time with a notification.

In the mobile Watch app, go to <strong>Watch preferences > Modes</strong> and make sure <strong>Sync across watch and phone</strong> is toggled on; then, in your main phone settings, go to <strong>Settings > Modes > Bedtime > Bedtime Routine</strong> and set a schedule.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-turn-on-loss-of-pulse-detection"><span>Turn on Loss of Pulse detection</span></h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PLDsXRmmavGEG4xX5nEa2o" name="Google Pixel Watch 3 Loss of Pulse Detection" alt="Screenshots of setting up Loss of Pulse Detection on Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PLDsXRmmavGEG4xX5nEa2o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9cbhdm5naQvRMrwimcyc3o" name="Google Pixel Watch 3 Loss of Pulse Detection" alt="Screenshots of setting up Loss of Pulse Detection on Google Pixel Watch 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9cbhdm5naQvRMrwimcyc3o.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>You may have already found this feature highlighted in the Fitbit app, but assumed you were too healthy to need it.

Netflix was up against other companies, including Paramount Skydance, and Comcast. However, Netflix ultimately secured the deal with Warner Bros. after weeks of negotiations, with its highly competitive, mostly cash offer,<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2025/12/05/netflix-seals-82-7bn-deal-to-acquire-warner-bros-and-hbo/#:~:text=Netflix%20has%20struck%20a%20definitive,billion%20(%E2%82%AC71.0%20billion)."> according to some reports. </a></p><p>This means iconic content like The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, along the DC Universe will join Netflix’s platform. Meaning, all the content on Warner Bros. (the studio), HBO, and the HBO Max streaming service will now be owned by Netflix.</p><p>“Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,” said David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, in a press release.</p><h2 id="industry-changing-move-2">Industry changing move</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1233px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="g87kAkMvSVjZnR2SWBpheJ" name="hbo-max-to-max-screenshot-169.JPG" alt="Screenshot from Max.com" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/g87kAkMvSVjZnR2SWBpheJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1233" height="693" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HBO Max)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This move comes at a time when we witnessed intense content dispute between <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/youtube-tv/disneys-channels-return-to-youtube-tv-after-intense-negotiations">Disney and YouTube</a>, which resulted in a weeks-long blackout for consumers. Combining the world's largest streaming platform with Hollywood's renowned studios makes Netflix one of the most dominant players in the content market. This could make it really tough on smaller streaming services to keep up with the massive Netflix-Warner entity.</p><p>While Netflix and Warner Bros. are optimistic about the acquisition, considering this enhances Netflix’s potential, allowing the company to significantly expand in the U.S. and gain a large foothold in the country.</p><p>However, on the flip side, there could be other concerns brewing. Some analysts think that this deal could face intense regulatory scrutiny and anti-trust battles in both the U.S. and Europe, when it comes to one large company essentially trying to monopolize the streaming industry. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/business/companies/netflix-to-buy-warner-bros-discoverys-studios-streaming-unit-for-72-billion-3821201">Critics argue</a> that merging these two could grant Netflix "too much power over Hollywood."</p><h2 id="what-this-means-for-subscribers-2">What this means for subscribers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hckMS4oXmVWDfzhVqp9RFG" name="lg-oled-netflix-originals-1-wide.jpg" alt="LG OLED TV Netflix Originals." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hckMS4oXmVWDfzhVqp9RFG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is highly likely that all of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/you-can-now-subscribe-hbo-and-hbo-max-through-youtube-tv">HBO and HBO Max</a> will be pulled into Netflix's already large catalog of entertainment. “By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling,” said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix, in a press release.</p><p>This also means that users stick to one platform, without having to switch between multiple apps and streaming services, and have all their favorite shows under one roof. They won't have to worry about licensing issues seen when some Warner Bros. shows move to other streaming services.</p><p>That said, sources close to the negotiations informed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netflix-warner-bros-discovery-combo-seen-lowering-costs-consumers-sources-say-2025-12-03/#:~:text=In%20recent%20talks%20with%20Warner,anonymity%20to%20discuss%20confidential%20negotiations.">Reuters</a> that the acquisition could actually be good for consumers. They stated that "the potential combination of its streaming service with HBO Max would benefit consumers by lowering the cost of a bundled offering."</p><p>Lastly, it is important to note that while the acquisition has been confirmed, Netflix states that HBO Max will likely operate separately for 12 to 18 months while they close the transaction, but this could keep HBO Max's subscribers in limbo, having them decide if they'd want to ditch the service until things move over to Netflix.</p><p>We're curious what you think about this acquisition!

The company already refreshed the Nest line with new smart home cameras and doorbells, and there's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/smart-home/googles-mysterious-smart-speaker-could-be-a-throwback-to-the-original-google-home-devices">Google Home Speaker</a> arriving in Spring 2026 to provide a modern answer to the Nest Mini and Nest Audio speakers. Aside from the giants in the smart home market like Google, Amazon, and Apple, there are always wild cards, and Motorola might soon be one of them.</p><p>Motorola appears to be gearing up to launch a smart speaker in collaboration with Bose that could rival Google's smart speaker offerings, according to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/motorola-x-bose-soundflow" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a>. The publication surfaced leaked images of the new smart speaker, which could be called the Motorola Soundflow. It's a wireless Bluetooth speaker that looks to add smart functionality, perhaps with Gemini integration or another voice assistant.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Bwbzpx9p5QcKEuvC7crzGX" name="Motorola-Bose-SoundFlow" alt="The Motorola and Bose Soundflow speaker in a leaked press image." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bwbzpx9p5QcKEuvC7crzGX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The wireless speaker sports a cylindrical design with mesh fabric fully covering the sides. There's a base with the Motorola wordmark on it, plus an LED light ring at the top. In fact, the light-blue LEDs at the top of the rumored Motorola Soundflow speaker are reminiscent of the blue glow of Amazon's Echo smart speakers. The light ring, paired with a microphone button at the top of the Motorola Soundflow, suggests this will indeed be a smart speaker.</p><p>Unlike Google Home and Nest speakers, the Motorola Soundflow appears to be a wireless. This would put in the same realm as options like the Sonos Roam 2, a wireless smart speaker with Sonos Voice Control and Amazon Alexa support. It also invokes similarities to the Amazon Echo Tap, a forgotten wireless smart speaker that was discontinued in 2018.</p><p>Bose has been expanding its audio collaborations to bring its sound to other companies' products, like Motorola. Previously, Bose and Motorola worked together to make the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/motorola-moto-loop-buds-review">Moto Buds Loop</a>. This year, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/baseus-bose-powered-inspire-xp1-earbuds-dolby-audio-and-a-standout-sound">Bose also teamed up with Baseus</a> to make cheaper earbuds and headphones with classic Bose sound.</p><p>Not many details are known about the Motorola Soundflow speaker, so we'll have to wait for an official announcement. If competitors like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sonos-roam-2-review">Sonos Roam 2</a> are any indication, the Motorola smart speaker could be priced between $100 and $200. If the brand wants to undercut its more-established competitors, we may see a lower price.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's become the focus of the company's Future Lens event, which it holds annually, and this year, TECNO is showing off some interesting advancements it's making in telephoto lenses.</p><p>The first is a collaboration with Samsung and Largan, a manufacturer of optical lenses, to create a compact telephoto camera module. The Dual-Mirror Reflect Telephoto module incorporates a coaxial optical design that folds the optical path of the image by reflecting light between lenses, enabling a smaller overall design (see the video below for a visual breakdown of how it works).</p><p>According to TECNO, this results in a 50% smaller telephoto camera module that still retains image quality and produces a donut bokeh effect.</p><p>As we start seeing thinner smartphones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-review">Galaxy S25 Edge</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-air-review">iPhone Air</a> (or even TECNO's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tecno-mobile.com/phones/product-detail/product/spark-slim/">Spark Slim</a>), having a slim telephoto lens such as this could address one of the main shortcomings of these types of devices, which often ditch the telephoto lens to retain a design that's as slim as possible.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UksznCeluac" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>TECNO also showed off a rather interesting telephoto module that can achieve continuous zoom up to 9x. This differs from how zoom works on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-camera">most smartphones</a>, which use digital zoom to fill in the gaps between optical lenses, such as moving from the primary sensor (1x) to a 3x telephoto camera. This can result in noticeable "focal jumps" when moving between sensors.</p><p>TECNO's method uses an Alvarez optical architecture to achieve a smaller module than would typically be needed for a method such as this. The result is the ability to move freely between 1x and 9x zoom without the "focal jumps."</p><p>This isn't the first time we've seen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/sony-xperia-1-iv-launch">continuous zoom in a smartphone</a>, but it remains pretty rare, likely due to size constraints. TECNO's solution also appears to offer a wider zoom range, which could potentially eliminate the need for a dedicated telephoto camera, or at least fewer than would be needed on a device like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u7Tl3ZsHEN4" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>TECNO hasn't stated when we can expect to see these technologies in its smartphones, but we hope it's sooner rather than later. The company has been on a crusade to improve image quality on its smartphones, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/tecno-future-lens-2024-announcements">addressing other camera pain points</a> such as accurate skin tones, fast focus, and "tap anywhere" zoom.</p><p>During the Future Lens 2025 event, TECNO also showcased its fully automated imaging laboratory, a collaboration with DXOMARK to help advance imaging capabilities in real-world scenarios.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The event has become a regular part of Samsung's annual CES extravaganza, where journalists and influencers are invited to get an early glimpse at the company's newest TVs, appliances, and other innovations.</p><p>The company will have its CEO and Head of Device eXperience Division, TM Roh, as the keynote speaker. Flanking Roh will be the president and head of the visual display business, SW Yong, and the executive vice president and head of digital appliances, Cheolgi Kim.</p><p>Samsung's keeping The First Look's event details pretty brief (and, albeit, a little vague). All that's been stated is that we're to get an early look at its 2026 vision for its Device eXperience division, as well as "new AI-driven customer experiences."</p><p>The First Look will be held on January 4, 2026 at 7 PM PST (10 PM EST) at the Latour Ballroom at the Wynn Las Vegas luxury hotel. Samsung adds that its event will be held two days before CES 2026 is set to begin, serving as a little prelude to the festivities for what's new and coming in tech.</p><p>Those interested can tune into the event through its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Samsung">YouTube channel</a> or via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://news.samsung.com/global/">Samsung Newsroom</a> directly. Additionally, Samsung TV Plus will also have the event live-streamed.</p><h2 id="what-are-we-to-expect-2">What are we to expect?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RVnKy9Lk7wA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>It's anyone's guess as to what Samsung might have cooking up for The First Look. We have some guesses, such as the company's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-exynos-2600-teaser-trailer-hypes-up-a-refined-chip-for-next-gen-galaxy">recent teaser for the Exynos 2600</a> chip. The short 30-second video hyped up the chip as a "refined" piece of hardware that boasts "optimizations" from top to bottom. Samsung, at the top of the clip, states that it listened to user grievances "in silence." Potentially, this means it's attempted to take strides toward improving performance issues, which often fall under the competition.</p><p>That teaser notably lacked hard numbers, but there are rumors about the chip. Some claim Samsung is improving the next-gen Exynos chip so greatly that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">it would be thrust into the limelight</a> with Qualcomm and Apple. However, others claim that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-custom-exynos-chip-might-bring-its-galaxy-s26-series-price-down">there are worries</a> about its true power when placed in a phone.</p><p>Maybe we'll see something about the Galaxy S26 series, but then again, maybe we won't. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-may-have-locked-in-the-galaxy-s26-launch-date">series is rumored</a> to have a February release, so Samsung might hold off and make us wait another month. AI is a big thing for Samsung, and it'll continue to be, given the tease for The First Look. Galaxy AI and Bixby are some potential aspects to keep our eyes on moving forward, or perhaps, there's something entirely new on the horizon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It’s been the trade-off: you usually have to pick between a slim design and a battery that lasts through dinner. Well, Nubia just threw a massive wrench in that narrative.</p><p>The new Nubia Fold is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.nubia.com/jp/products/smartphones/nubia/nubia-fold" target="_blank">officially here</a>, and instead of quietly joining the pack, it’s going after Samsung’s <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> with a bigger battery, a lower price, and the kind of specs you’d expect from something far more expensive.</p><p>Its headline feature is a colossal 6,560mAh battery (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Nubia-Fold-arrives-cheaper-than-Galaxy-Z-Fold7-with-Snapdragon-8-Elite-and-49-larger-battery.1176289.0.html" target="_blank">Notebookcheck</a>). To put that number in perspective, that’s not just "good for a foldable" — it’s arguably the biggest battery we’ve ever seen in the form factor. You’re looking at a power cell that significantly outpaces the Galaxy Z Fold 7 (4,400mAh).</p><h2 id="it-s-a-spec-for-dollar-powerhouse-2">It's a spec-for-dollar powerhouse</h2><p>What makes this launch even more aggressive is the price tag. The Nubia Fold has landed in Japan for ¥178,560, which converts to roughly $1,150. For that price, you get a book-style foldable running the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor for nearly $800 less than Samsung’s latest offering. While competitors are pushing the $2,000 mark, Nubia is proving that the foldable tax doesn’t have to be quite so steep.</p><p>You aren't just paying for a big battery, either. The device features an expansive 8-inch OLED main display (120Hz, naturally) and a usable 6.5-inch cover screen. Despite packing that massive battery, Nubia managed to keep the chassis reasonably slim at 5.4mm unfolded and 11.1mm folded.</p><p>Of course, when you undercut the market leader by this much, corners get cut.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1440px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="8hAKSRMjcEPa9NFUgBXnCJ" name="Nubia-Fold-screen" alt="Nubia Fold in a woman's hand showing its screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8hAKSRMjcEPa9NFUgBXnCJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1440" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nubia)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, the cameras. Instead of the periscope zooms and high-end sensors found on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, the Nubia Fold sticks to a more modest setup: a 50MP main, a 50MP ultrawide, and a 5MP macro sensor.</p><p>Second, durability. The phone carries an IP54 rating. That means it can handle dust and a splash of water, but unlike the IP68-rated Galaxy Z Fold 7, this isn't a phone you want to drop in the pool.</p><p>At the moment, the Nubia Fold is only available in Japan. If Nubia releases it in other countries, it might push Samsung and other brands to reconsider their prices and battery choices for future models.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Those rumors claimed that Xiaomi was wasting no time in hopping on the trifold bandwagon after Huawei dropped that trifold surprise, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/huawei-mate-xt-is-the-most-exciting-phone-around">the Mate XT</a>.

That patent delivered an alleged early design concept for it, with a horizontal camera bar that was reminiscent of the Mix Fold 3.

For weeks, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsungs-massive-wear-os-6-update-lands-on-the-galaxy-watch-6-series">only users in Korea could try the Wear OS 6 update</a>, while most people elsewhere waited.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/12/04/galaxy-watch-6-one-ui-8-update-wider-rollout-us/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> reports the update is now available to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6</a> users in the U.S., including those with T-Mobile and Verizon models.</p><p>The update changes how the watch looks and feels in daily use. One UI 8 Watch runs on top of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a>, and you can see the difference right away with a cleaner interface, smoother scrolling, and better animation transitions.</p><p>Tiles now stack vertically, making them easier to scroll through while you’re moving. Menus are simpler and more direct. The new bottom Now Bar stays visible, so you can quickly get back to ongoing tasks.</p><h2 id="gestures-you-ll-actually-use-2">Gestures you’ll actually use</h2><p>The update also improves how you use the watch with new gesture controls. Double-pinch gestures work much better now, so using the watch with one hand feels practical instead of frustrating.</p><p>For wellness, the update gives you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/wear-os/samsung-announces-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program">more detailed sleep metrics and energy scores</a>, using features from the latest Galaxy Ring technology.</p><p>Even though the Watch 6 is two years old, this update makes it feel like a newer device, which is exactly what long-term owners want from a major software refresh. It breathes new life into a wearable that was starting to feel a bit neglected next to the shiny new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-8">Galaxy Watch 8</a>.</p><p>And while updates can be huge headaches on some wearables, installing this one is straightforward. Just open the Galaxy Wearable app, go to Watch settings, check for updates, and make sure you have Wi-Fi and enough battery.</p> ]]></dc:content>

However, as with every new Pixel update, the December 2025 update for Pixel 10 devices seems to be causing issues with the always-on display.</p><p>As spotted by a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pd3vu4/aod_flicker_after_latest_update/">user on Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/pixel-10-always-on-display-flicker-3622356/">Android Authority</a>), Pixel 10 owners report that post the December 2025 update, the always-on display on their devices flickers under certain circumstances.</p><p>Some users say it flickers when the screensaver appears during wireless charging, while others report a "hard flicker" when the clock updates in always-on display mode.</p><p>Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1pd3vu4/comment/ns4ve61/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user reports</a> that after unlocking their device while in always-on display mode, the screen goes "completely black" for a second. We haven't experienced the issue on our end with any <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/live/news/google-pixel-10-launch-live-blog">Pixel 10</a> units, but based on the Reddit thread, many users seem to be affected.</p><h2 id="pixel-10-owners-report-odd-screen-flickers-in-aod-2">Pixel 10 owners report odd screen flickers in AoD</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FodmpRB2ZZqDh3kmkxidDQ" name="google-pixel-10-wireless-qi2-charging-dock-0204" alt="The official Google Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charger and dock for the Google Pixel 10 series" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FodmpRB2ZZqDh3kmkxidDQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, it appears the bug is affecting only Pixel 10 devices, at least based on current reports, and isn't impacting other Pixel models.</p><p>If you're facing similar issues on your Pixel 10, the only reliable workaround for now is turning off always-on display from Settings. You can disable it by going to <strong>Settings > Display & touch > Always-on display</strong> and toggling it off.</p><p>This is actually the second time since the Pixel 10 series launched in August 2025 that users have reported a display issue. Back in September 2025, Pixel 10 owners said the screen would turn black during transitions, which Google <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-fixes-fuzzy-display-issues-on-pixel-10-and-10-pro-with-latest-ota-update">fixed with a later update</a>.</p><p>However, now, issues with AoD display are being reported. We haven't heard anything official from Google about the bug yet, but if it's widespread enough, the company may roll out a hotfix for Pixel 10 users soon.

Qualcomm is delivering sizeable gains with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/i-used-a-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-powered-gaming-phone-and-im-convinced-qualcomm-has-the-fastest-mobile-chipset-theres-just-one-glaring-issue">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a>, MediaTek did the same with the Dimensity 9500, and even Google got its act together with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5</a>, finally switching to TSMC's 3nm node — the same as Qualcomm and MediaTek.</p><p>I used five devices with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 over the course of the last month — the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-camera-review">OnePlus 15</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">POCO F8 Ultra</a>, iQOO 15, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/redmagic-11-pro-review">Redmagic 11 Pro</a>, and the Realme GT 8 Pro — along with four devices powered by the Dimensity 9500: <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a>, X300 Pro, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and Find X9. Finally, I tested key devices in the Pixel 10 family, including the Pixel 10, 10 Pro XL, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-may-not-be-the-best-foldable-but-its-the-one-i-like-the-most">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>I'm not going into too many details about each platform, but as a high-level overview, all chip vendors are using the latest cores and tout heady gains. Obviously, Qualcomm stands out for its use of custom cores on the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, with the platform featuring a second-gen design with double-digit increase in performance, and there's a similar level of uptick when it comes to gaming.</p><p>Having said that, what MediaTek is doing is even more interesting. The vendor is using Arm's latest cores, including the C1 Ultra, C1 Pro, and C1 Premium. The G1 Ultra GPU is terrific as well, and overall, Arm really turned things up a notch this year. On that note, the Tensor G5 is actually good this time. It still doesn't use the latest Arm cores or isn't anywhere as fast as what Qualcomm and MediaTek are offering, but it doesn't feel intentionally hobbled, and that's an achievement in and of itself.</p><h2 id="snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5-vs-snapdragon-8-elite-vs-tensor-g5-vs-dimensity-9500-2">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 vs. Snapdragon 8 Elite vs. Tensor G5 vs. Dimensity 9500</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="uyH7AX7dEN4vUNkg2FqBwD" name="2025 phones" alt="Flagship Android phones, including Find X9 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and POCO F8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uyH7AX7dEN4vUNkg2FqBwD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's take a look at how the new platforms hold up in synthetic workloads.

As you can see, the difference in negligible in multi-core workloads between the two, but when comparing to last year's silicon, there is still a decent boost.</p><p>Similarly, Qualcomm has a lead in 3DMark's Wild Life test, but things are on an equal footing with the ray tracing-based Solar Bay workload. The gains aren't as noticeable from last year either, and the only thing these tests illustrate is just how far behind the Tensor G5 is in this regard. Google says its focus is on AI, and it doesn't want to chase raw numbers, and that bears out in the testing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="BMgbkQZbZ2AA8EJDcbbpPD" name="2025 phones" alt="Flagship Android phones, including Find X9 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL, and POCO F8 Ultra" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BMgbkQZbZ2AA8EJDcbbpPD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Thankfully, it isn't the same in real-world testing. I used the Pixel 10 Pro XL as my daily driver for well over two months, and it is just as fluid as the POCO F8 Ultra or the X300 Pro at a lot of daily tasks. Yes, it doesn't hold up as well at gaming — even though there's much better thermal management — and there is noticeable throttling in extended gaming sessions. Even then, it is better than just about every other Pixel I've used — which I know isn't saying much.</p><p>Coming to Qualcomm and MediaTek, there really isn't much of a difference in actual usage. Both have a similar level of efficiency, but if I had to pick a winner, I'd say the Dimensity 9500 has the edge — my Find X9 Pro lasts longer even though it has a similar-sized battery as the OnePlus 15.</p><p>Both chipsets do a fantastic job when it comes to gaming, and they handle demanding games well. There is some throttling with extended use, but it doesn't affect the image quality in a noticeable way. The only point of contention is overheating — this affects Qualcomm much more than MediaTek. In my use, I found the Redmagic 11 Pro to get considerably hotter than the X300 Pro in gaming sessions lasting over an hour, and while it didn't get as hot as when I ran synthetic tests, it was still uncomfortable to hold.</p><p>The X300 Pro also got hot, but it was never to a point where I couldn't hold the device. The maximum it went up to was 43 degrees Celsius, with the Redmagic 11 Pro crossing 48 degrees, and exceeding 52 degrees when running 3DMark tests.</p><p>On the whole, I think MediaTek has the edge this time around. I'm not denying that Qualcomm isn't as good, but intermittent issues with overheating have proven to be annoying, and I don't see that with my X300 Pro or Find X9 Pro.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, both companies have joined together to create a "multicloud networking service" for the sake of fostering "reliable connectivity." Reuters taps the vice president of network services at AWS, Robert Kennedy, who said, "This collaboration between AWS and Google Cloud represents a fundamental shift in multicloud connectivity."</p><p>The nitty-gritty details of this new service state that Amazon's side of the agreement brings its internconnect-multicloud services to the table.</p><p>This is then joined by Google Cloud's Cross-Cloud Interconnect. The reports say that, in tandem, Amazon's and Google's cloud services should improve the "network interoperability" to hopefully reduce the likelihood of such major outages from taking down the internet. Officially,  the vice president and general manager of cloud networking at Google Cloud, Rob Enns, informed Reuters that this joint measure is to make it easier for data and apps to move "between clouds" for the consumer.</p><p>Amazon and Google add that their joint work to bring about this multicloud networking service should help customers with "private" and "high-speed" connections between the two.</p><h2 id="october-20-was-a-dark-day-for-a-few-hours-2">October 20 was a dark day... for a few hours</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TEwLHZ7G9AWw2N9PBksz8A" name="AWS-logo" alt="Free Amazon Web Services Image" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TEwLHZ7G9AWw2N9PBksz8A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Logo Wine)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It was hard to miss it, as October 20 was when a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/massive-aws-outage-took-down-the-internet">massive AWS outage impacted thousands</a>, effectively taking the internet down for several hours. AWS (Amazon Web Services) had its outage peak at roughly 3 AM ET, though things started faltering at around midnight. The outage hit the  US-EAST-1 (Northern Virginia) region pretty hard, which is the service's largest data center hub.</p><p>This outage, which took out a chunk of the internet, as well as major apps like Reddit, Snapchat, and even Fortnite, started to draw attention to a critical fact: AWS is heavily relied on. Government services around the world were even impacted, drawing further cries for there to be diversity in multi-cloud strategies, so this doesn't (necessarily) happen so harshly.</p><p>The issues within the EC2 network caused severe latency and "increased error rates" for those trying to get online. AWS even stated that its connection health was "degraded," prompting it to continue to seek measures to alleviate such issues. After roughly six hours, apps and services were beginning to come back online, but the damage had been done.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra (2025)</a> landed recently with a storage bump to 64GB, it wasn’t exactly the generational leap many of us were craving. Still, if the latest rumors are true, a real successor is on the way — just not as soon as you might like.</p><p>Samsung is reportedly hard at work on a device internally dubbed the Galaxy Watch 9 Ultra. Don't let that clunky moniker throw you off, though. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.galaxyclub.nl/samsung/galaxy-watch-ultra-2/" target="_blank">GalaxyClub</a> suggests this will almost certainly hit shelves as the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2.</p><p>The twist? Rumor has it the new Ultra won’t be released until the summer of 2026, meaning there will be no major rugged update in 2025.</p><p>This timeline puts it on track to launch alongside the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-9">Galaxy Watch 9</a> series and the next generation of foldables, specifically the Galaxy Z Fold 8 and Flip 8. It looks like Samsung is changing its approach, possibly releasing Ultra models less often, similar to how Apple handles its high-end wearables.</p><h2 id="expect-a-bigger-leap-2">Expect a bigger leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="EV7DGcvqEkNZSifVxHqR9" name="samsung-galaxy-watch-vs-apple-watch-ultra-2-3.jpg" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra vs. Apple Watch Ultra 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/EV7DGcvqEkNZSifVxHqR9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why the wait? It seems Samsung decided to skip a big hardware update in 2025 to focus on a bigger upgrade for 2026. We might get a device that isn't just a spec bump but potentially a complete architectural refresh.</p><p>Right now, rumors suggest the new Ultra will be based a lot on the Galaxy Watch 9’s development, but there isn’t much information available yet.</p><p>If the Ultra 2 shares DNA with the Watch 9, we’re likely to see more advanced health features and greater processing power. With the Apple Watch Ultra 3 already making waves with its S10 chip and "Workout Buddy" AI features, Samsung can’t afford to just release another minor refresh.</p><p>For buyers weighing whether to wait, the current Galaxy Watch Ultra remains a solid pick. Its titanium build, dual-frequency GPS, rugged water- and impact-resistant design, and Galaxy AI–powered health tracking hold up well today.</p> ]]></dc:content>

There's also 256GB of expandable storage and a surprising number of ports, especially given that, at 11.8mm thick, the laptop is actually <em>thinner </em>than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6</a>. It's also the first Chromebook to come with the Quick Insert key, a new feature that lets you access Gemini and other streamlined AI features more easily. </p><p>Of course, there are a few drawbacks with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus. For one, it doesn't have a touchscreen or a convertible design, and the battery life (estimated around 13 hours max) is a bit disappointing given the steep price tag. You also don't get a fingerprint scanner with the Galaxy Chromebook Plus, and you're limited to the 256GB storage configuration (although you can expand the storage using a microSD card). </p><p>On a $300-$500 Chromebook, these issues wouldn't be a big deal, but I've come to expect more from laptops in the $750 range. Fortunately, this Best Buy discount places the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus much closer to where it needs to be, just in time for holiday shopping. </p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-17">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

This is because, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-redirects-fitbit-store-purchases">according to the data</a>, most consumers nowadays are more interested in buying a smartwatch with fitness features, rather than a wearable that's <em>solely</em> based on fitness tracking. </p><p>This means that the Charge 6 might be the last <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-fitbit">traditional Fitbit</a> that we ever see, which is a bummer for folks who simply want to track their fitness goals without all the bells and whistles (and accompanying price tag) of a smartwatch. </p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE" name="Garmin-Forerunner-165-polar-h10-coros-pace-3-and-fitbit-charge-6-on-table.jpeg" alt="The Garmin Forerunner 165, COROS PACE 3, Fitbit Charge 6, and Polar H10 sitting together on a table." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzEYL8n2Zzj2NCE2bAEUvE.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The good news is that, despite first hitting store shelves in 2023, the Fitbit Charge 6 is still one of the best fitness trackers that money can buy. You get the iconic petite design that once made Fitbit ubiquitous, plus comprehensive health and fitness tracking that monitors HR, SpO2, ECG, EDA, skin temperature, and more. You also get features like sleep tracking, NFC, and GPS straight out of the box, plus up to seven days of battery life on a single charge.</p><p>We were also happy to learn that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/fitbit/google-promises-new-fitbit-hardware-in-2026-past-statements-suggest-which">Google will finally be releasing some new Fitbit hardware in 2026</a>, so hope isn't entirely lost for folks who prefer the band-style fitness tracker. So yes, if you want the absolute <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smartwatches-fitness">best fitness wearable</a> on the market, go with the Pixel Watch 4 or perhaps something from Garmin. But if you want something lightweight and simple that doesn't sacrifice fitness-focused specs, the Charge 6 is still a great choice (especially at this price).</p><h2 id="holiday-shopping-2025-quick-links-22">Holiday shopping 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 50% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>major discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Early vestiges of the company's code in the Pixel Watch app suggest that there are plans to return these "wrist turns" for managing calls and handling notifications. Per the publication, Google's descriptions state users can "silence calls" by turning their wrist, and they can "close alerting notifications."</p><p>The second feature in the app's code, while not an old Wear OS feature, is something Google's competitor, Apple, has graced its smartwatch with. Other strings of code suggest Google is developing a "Double Pinch" gesture, likely leveraging the hand your watch is near.</p><p>The code summary states, "Use double pinch to answer calls, interact with notifications, take photos, and more."</p><p>It's still early, as the app didn't offer more information, such as more detailed use examples, for the report to dig into. However, as the publication notes, the "wrist turn" feature is giving old-school Wear OS vibes. There was a time when users could flick their wrist to "navigate" their watch, such as notifications. More details will likely get added as Google's development continues, but for now, we'll have to settle for this.</p><h2 id="look-no-hands-2">Look, no hands!</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1207px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="r6izqqfVqicH9t6QR3UKGa" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-4-Gold-Lemongrass-official-lifestyle-1" alt="The Pixel Watch 4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/r6izqqfVqicH9t6QR3UKGa.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1207" height="679" attribution="" endorsement="" class="inline"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's been relatively quiet on the new features front for Google's Pixel Watch, but there have been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/final-farewell-googles-first-pixel-watch-receives-its-last-minor-update">moves made for general support</a>. When November kicked off, Google started rolling out the final minor update for its original Pixel Watch. While this patch only brought security fixes and the like, it did so as the last patch the O.G. glass-domed device will ever see. Consumers with the original watch won't receive any more major Wear OS updates, but they can still keep their apps up to date via the Play Store.</p><p>Unfortunately, the model isn't picking up Wear OS 6. It's had a good run, one could say, as it picked up Wear OS 3.5 through 5.1 over the past few years.</p><p>Around the same time, Google announced that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/google-confirms-end-of-clock-app-support-on-non-pixel-watches-amidst-user-backlash">it was ending support</a> for the Clock app on non-Pixel watches. This concerns the Wear OS Clock app, something that Google cut off from others amid a series of backlash from users. Non-Pixel watches have lost the Clock app, as well as any updates for it.</p><p>Though users didn't find it too kind, Google tried to defend itself, stating, "watch brands offering their own default clock apps on Wear OS." Instead, Google is pushing users toward Clock apps offered by the watch's maker and plenty of others available on the Play Store.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While battery life still hinders this dream from becoming a reality, I often wear my AI glasses (as they're now known) whenever I leave the house or go for a run.</p><p>Like a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-smartwatch">smartwatch</a> (which I also don't wear 24/7), my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-review">Oakley Meta HSTN</a> smart glasses have given me a new way to document my most special workouts and provide real insight into how I'm progressing over the course of my lifelong fitness journey.</p><p>I recently wore these glasses during a 5K Spartan Race and recorded every obstacle and running segment on the course. This means I can go back and check my exact performance on each obstacle the next time I run a Spartan — something I do multiple times per year — and highlight what I need to improve for the next run. It's an invaluable tool that's become part of my regular arsenal, especially now that Meta has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-smart-glasses-video-stability-november-2025-update" target="_blank">substantially improved</a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-smart-glasses-video-stability-november-2025-update"> video recording stability</a> via a free software update.</p><figure class="van-image-figure pull-left inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:661px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:29.95%;"><img id="shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6" name="click-to-follow-ac-lloyd-sq-g" alt="Click to Follow Android Central on Google" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/shw6vroRiUxqcvWLRPZjB6.jpg" mos="" align="left" fullscreen="" width="661" height="198" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pull-left"></p></div></div></figure><p>Enjoy our content?

This is mainly because it's my job to track these sorts of events and compare devices, but this year has seen a new addition to the collection: Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses. The first time I ran with these was in early August at a rather muddy Spartan Race, and this time was on a perfect, cloud-free, extra-sunny 70-degree day.</p><p>The experience couldn't have been more different, but both times, Oakley Meta HSTNs made it all the way through the race without missing a beat. Now, that's not to say it recorded the <em>entire</em> race. The maximum recording time for a video from any pair of Meta AI glasses is 3 minutes, and I never recorded long enough to reach that limit.</p><p>Instead, I long-press the recording button before approaching any obstacle, then tap it again to end the recording. This ensured that I had enough battery to record every obstacle, plus some running segments, but just barely so. I ended the 1-hour and 9-minute race with 4% battery remaining on the glasses after all the videos and photos had been synced with my phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="X7YHad2zv6qk2ZCq6mgA8i" name="oakley-meta-hstn-meta-ai-app-garmin-workout-summary-02" alt="Oakley Meta HSTN AI glasses alongside the Meta AI app, containing a workout summary using data gathered from a Garmin smart watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/X7YHad2zv6qk2ZCq6mgA8i.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In total, I recorded 31 minutes and 49 seconds of video, all captured at 30FPS, 1700p resolution, and in HDR with stabilization. As I showed in my initial batch of testing with Oakley Meta HSTN glasses, using the "1080p" setting provides <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes">the best </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/i-found-oakley-meta-hstns-hidden-superpower-for-athletes" target="_blank">balance of quality and stabilization</a>, while also allowing <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/oakley-meta-hstn-smart-glasses-battery-life-review" target="_blank">for longer battery life</a> — something that's very important during an event where you can't just stop and charge the glasses.</p><p>But this also shows that there are still substantial limitations to these glasses. Being able to record every obstacle in a race this long is great, but I couldn't have done that in any of the longer Spartan Races offered. Apparently, my stamina matches that of Meta's AI glasses, but more seasoned runners will likely find this battery life to be inadequate.</p><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JV9rWUGxqMc" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>The most obvious modern "solution" to this would be to get a newer Garmin watch and enable the new Garmin x Meta integration, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/i-tested-garmin-integration-on-oakley-meta-vanguard-glasses-heres-good-bad-and-ugly">something my colleague Michael Hicks tested during a recent marathon</a>. This would ensure that clips are recorded only at specific milestones, such as every mile marker or at the end of the race. It then stitches together a nice montage video that's easily shareable on social media.</p><p>But as Hicks points out, the clips are "mostly stitched-together footage of random moments of my runs, none especially noteworthy unless I took them myself." That doesn't sound like a good fit for a Spartan Race to me, though I'd need to test that specifically once I get a newer <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">Garmin watch</a>.</p><p>But aside from video, I really like how <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/meta-smart-glasses-ai-tips-and-tricks">Meta AI</a> summarizes the runs. Not only does it get relevant data from the run itself — fueled by the Garmin Watch integration and visual data from the glasses — but it also ties in recent workout data to give you a better explanation of your overall performance.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="rYQi45up45VBJm8gJP7yAJ" name="garmin-app-spartan-race-results-nov-2025" alt="The results of a 5K Spartan Race as recorded in the Garmin app via a Garmin Instinct 2X Solar" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rYQi45up45VBJm8gJP7yAJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In my case, I'm simply not a runner, but I'm working on improving that part of the workout. This Garmin x Meta integration clearly does a good job of summarizing what's been going on with my recent workout data, something I'm not particularly good at on my own.</p><p>Even with an older Garmin watch, the integration automatically imported my run and stored it in the Meta AI app's "workouts" section, complete with a Meta AI summary of my progress and associated media I captured. Since I haven't run a race like this with the watch before this test, it didn't have much data to work with, but it makes me excited to see what it cobbles together next time!</p><p>Aside from running, which I already knew I struggled with going in, I realize I need to work on pulling my torso over higher obstacles (6 feet and higher walls), as well as the niche skill of throwing a javelin into a bale of hay. Without the video evidence, I surely would have forgotten these things by the next time I have to run, and that's a huge part of why I love wearing Oakley or Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses during these events!</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="919796d4-eab9-4a24-9b1c-53bacd6603c4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pRxAtAtsLkG2oTnhntPqgD.jpg' alt="An official product render of Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Oakley Meta</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">HSTN smart glasses</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are part of the latest generation of Meta AI glasses, sporting 3K cameras, excellent stabilization, trademark Oakley PRIZM lenses, 8 hours of battery life, and great integration with Garmin smart watches.</p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-faq"><span>FAQ</span></h2><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>What are the key technical features of the Oakley Meta HSTN smart glasses?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Oakley Meta HSTN are part of the latest generation of Meta AI glasses.

The greeting on the page reads as "Hi" instead of "Hello," with the prompt bar and Gemini's suggestions right below it.  Additionally, you notice a spinning animation on the Gemini sparkle logo on the initial page load, while the prompt box also has more defined outlines.</p><p>The menu on the left of the homepage also receives a tiny tweak, with a new "My Stuff" section along with the existing "Gems" and "Chats". As you may have noticed on the Gemini app,  My Stuff stores images, videos, and Canvas creations separately from your Gemini chats for easy access. By tapping content in My Stuff,  you'll see different conversations with Gemini that you've generated images for.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ppK5xw9dyh6rDJLkV9gcET" name="Gemini-3-Google-Search" alt="A promo image for Gemini 3 in Google Search." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ppK5xw9dyh6rDJLkV9gcET.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The website also notes that, in the chat conversations, there’s a new dropdown menu when clicking the chat name to "Share conversation, Pin, Rename, and Delete."</p><p>Google seems to be revamping Gemini's UI after it recently rolled out its latest models, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/googles-november-gemini-drop-adds-gemini-3-nano-banana-pro-and-more">Gemini 3 Pro and Nano Banana Pro</a>, which came in with Google's November drop.

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google is reportedly beginning to work on an improved way for users with dual-SIM to manage them in Messages.</p><p>Google's work was spotted by tipster AssembleDebug (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-messages-sim-switcher-new-workflow-3620777/">Android Authority</a>) in a recent Messages app beta. What's been reported is that the company is working on a way for users to swap between their SIMs while (sort of) remaining in the messaging thread. While in an RCS chat, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/TCj7_JdAZCs">the tipster found</a> that long-pressing the typing field in the chat will produce that standard floating menu, but with a "Switch SIM" addition between the Gemini icon and Paste.</p><p>After tapping "Switch SIM," Messages moved the tipster to their profile's details page, where they can interact with the switching menu for their available dual-SIM. In practice, the user would tap a new SIM and quickly hop out. The "good thing" here is that, when you do hop out, you're doing so into the same chat you've just been moved from. In a way, it's removing a couple of extra steps one would normally take.</p><p>A small change that occurs here involves Messages clearly showing the tipster moving from a T-Mobile SIM to Visible in the typing field.</p><p>It's pretty clear from this that Google's working on a way to make this process easier to manage. Currently, you'd have to leave the chat, enter your details, change the SIM, and then walk those steps backwards, plus enter the chat you want. However, it's <em>probably </em>still not as smooth as it could be, which is something AssembleDebug also notes. Perhaps a perfect scenario would be to handle all of this switching right in the same chat without ever having to leave (even if it is for a moment).</p><h2 id="dual-sim-gets-another-look-2">Dual-SIM gets another look</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6016px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qEBpNmWm4DdEDy7sbyynw4" name="Google-Messages-hero.jpg" alt="Google Messages left-panel menu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qEBpNmWm4DdEDy7sbyynw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6016" height="3384" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Dual-SIM support for Messages and its RCS chats <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-us-rollout">rolled out on Android phones</a> around this time last year in beta. It was a server-side update that took a little time for all Android users rocking dual-SIMs to notice. However, in the update, consumers on AT&T, Visible, T-Mobile, and more were starting to see it, per Reddit reports at the time. It was also made aware during this time that, within the app's RCS chat settings, users could toggle which SIM card they wanted active.</p><p>If both were active, users could conveniently switch via their details page before texting. Alternatively, you could just have one active and not worry about switching, in which case you'd have a few extra steps to enable it and then switch.</p><p>Google had been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-us-rollout">working on proper support for dual-SIM</a> since earlier that year, taking roughly nine months to craft it and roll it out to users.</p><p>The feature soon arrived at the beginning of 2025 <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-dual-sim-rcs-support-more-users-regions-stable">for even more users</a> on Pixels and Samsung Galaxy phones in the U.S., Canada, and Germany.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While the brand always did a great job with the hardware, it wasn't until the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f7-ultra-review">F7 Ultra</a> that it was able to deliver a phone with a great camera, and the F8 Ultra builds on that foundation. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi/poco-f8-ultra-review">F8 Ultra review</a>, I called it one of the best phones in the $800 category, and I stand by that — it really is a great all-rounder.</p><p>There's just one problem: POCO isn't bringing the phone to India. At the launch of the F8 Pro and F8 Ultra, POCO indicated that it sold 94 million devices globally in its seven-year history, and that's pretty good. While the brand didn't go into regional figures, India is POCO's biggest market by a considerable amount; its presence in the country and positioning as an affordable brand has allowed it to make significant inroads.</p><p>It's this positioning that's hurting the brand now. I asked POCO India and global spokespeople for an on-the-record statement about why its latest device isn't coming to India, but I didn't get one. That said, it isn't hard to understand why POCO is reticent to launch the F8 Ultra in India; the brand is still seen as a budget player, and it just doesn't have the cachet to sell a phone that costs over $700 in the country — there wouldn't be any takers.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.34%;"><img id="Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y8GPUuRGuXuRsVSQyeZxTN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4901" height="2761" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Xiaomi — POCO's parent brand — knows this well, as it has tried several times in the past to sell its costliest phones in the country to no avail. That's why we didn't get Mi-branded flagships for a while, and it's only in the last two years that it started selling its Ultra models in India. I see this as a prestige play, where Xiaomi is able to raise its brand profile by marketing devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-14-ultra-review">Xiaomi 14 Ultra</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/xiaomi-15-ultra-review">Xiaomi 15 Ultra</a> in the country, and this is similar to what OPPO and Vivo also do with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">X300 Pro</a>.</p><p>With POCO, however, the focus is still on the budget category. This is why the brand didn't bring the F7 Ultra to the country earlier in the year, only debuting the budget-focused F7 instead. POCO positions its products at a younger audience, and that ostensibly means catering to the budget segment with devices in the C and M series. I'm positive that these entry-level and budget phones outsell even the likes of the X7 Pro, and in that context, it's easy to see why POCO didn't bring the F8 Ultra to India.</p><p>Even then, I think the brand should have taken a gamble this time around. Phone pricing is trending up in India — like all global markets — and this year's flagships highlight that. Vivo sub-brand iQOO's devices are positioned against POCO's products, and the iQOO 15 debuted in India for ₹72,999 ($811), a staggering increase of ₹18,000 ($200) from the iQOO 13's ₹54,999 ($611) pricing last year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5030px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N" name="POCO F8 Ultra" alt="POCO F8 Ultra review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ui8kXS5HDi7UrBVJ2YHY7N.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5030" height="2833" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With a significant price increase this year and the likes of Realme and other brands also rolling out phones in this category, this would have been the ideal year for POCO to bring its costlier portfolio of products to the country. The F8 Ultra is positioned well against the iQOO 15 and Realme GT 8 Pro, and given POCO's recognition as a value-focused brand, it would have sold a decent number of phones by undercutting the F8 Ultra against its key rivals.</p><p>After all, it was this exact strategy that allowed POCO to rise in prominence with the F1 all those years ago. The F1 was an outlier in the sheer amount of value it delivered, and it's clear that we won't get devices like that again; the F2 Pro was proof of that. But to not bring the F8 Ultra to India feels like a short-sighted move, considering when other brands are willing to take a bet on the country.</p><p>If nothing else, this is hurting POCO's image in the country. I get that devices like the F8 Ultra won't sell in anywhere as many numbers as the brand's budget phones, but having marquee phones to market only elevates a brand's profile, and Samsung does this to great effect globally. It positions Galaxy S and Z devices as aspirational products, and sells millions of Galaxy A and FE devices with the clear implication that they're just as good as the flagships — POCO (and Xiaomi in general) doesn't seem to get this strategy.</p><p>The way Xiaomi and POCO position their brands in the U.K. is drastically different to India, and I find that puzzling considering both brands are actually recognizable in the country. POCO is doing all the right things when it comes to the actual hardware, and it now needs to get its strategy in order and ensure its best devices are sold in its biggest market.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It feels like a pressure gauge, measuring everything from political flashpoints to new AI trends and a nonstop pop culture cycle. Looking at both the global and U.S. lists, some patterns are clear: AI is now part of daily life, politics filled the headlines, and entertainment kept surprising us in unexpected ways.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/gemini">Gemini</a> topped the global chart, showing just how much AI has become part of everyday conversation. DeepSeek, another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/deepseek-already-had-a-usd1-trillion-impact-and-its-just-getting-started">big AI model</a>, also made it into the global top 10.</p><p>In the U.S., that curiosity looked a bit different.

There were also moments that shocked people around the world. Searches for Charlie Kirk jumped worldwide, and not just for political reasons. His assassination and passing became the most-searched global news event and the top news topic in the U.S., leading to days of nonstop coverage and speculation.</p><p>Events like the situation in Iran, the LA fires, the US government shutdown, and the election of Pope Leo XIV kept people checking for updates. Natural disasters such as Hurricane Melissa and the Kamchatka earthquake also led to more crisis-related searches than usual.</p><p>Entertainment also drew a lot of attention. Around the world, Anora and Superman were the most-searched movies, while in the U.S., KPop Demon Hunters was the top film people looked up.</p><h2 id="pop-culture-tastes-are-divided-2">Pop culture tastes are divided</h2><p>For television, Monster: The Ed Gein Story was the most popular show worldwide, while The Hunting Wives led in the U.S. If it seemed like Taylor Swift released something new every month, you were right. She dominated global lyric searches and made up half of the U.S. top 10 songs list.</p><p>Sports fans were active, too. The FIFA Club World Cup was the most-searched sporting event worldwide. In the U.S., fans helped the Seattle Mariners and Oklahoma City Thunder reach the top team rankings. Terence Crawford, Shedeur Sanders, and Rory McIlroy were among the most-searched athletes globally, showing how sports interests shifted this year.</p><p>The internet’s love for rabbit holes showed up in some unusual trends, too. There were spikes in “Holy airball” memes and recipe searches like hot honey cottage cheese beef bowls and dumpling bakes. Travel searches also reflected bigger changes: worldwide, Kyoto Station and Kew Gardens were popular on Google Maps, while Americans planned trips to Boston, Seattle, and Tokyo.</p><p>If anything, 2025 showed that our searches reflect what we care about, what worries us, and what we want to learn next.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Starting December 10, the platform will automatically sign out users under 16. It’s a fundamental change to how the platform works for young people, and Google isn't hiding its frustration.</p><p>What was initially billed as a crackdown on social media apps has now expanded to include YouTube, despite <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/our-opening-statement-to-the-senate-environment-and-communications-references-committee/" target="_blank">Google’s insistence</a> that YouTube doesn’t operate like Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat. But regulators ruled otherwise, and the platform must comply with the Social Media Minimum Age Act.</p><p>The timing and scope have caught parents, teens, and creators off guard. For many Australians, YouTube was more than just a social feed. It offered entertainment, homework help, and a space for creators. Now, all those features disappear as soon as a user is found to be under 16.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:401px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:216.96%;"><img id="hrxiVeWY3EDS4EcDBk9XqX" name="youtube-ban-for-teens" alt="YouTube pop-up message telling teens in Australia they need to be 16 or older to use the platform" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrxiVeWY3EDS4EcDBk9XqX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="401" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Instead, they will be pushed into a stripped-down YouTube experience where they can watch videos but can’t like, subscribe, comment, or upload. Parental controls disappear entirely because YouTube’s supervision tools only work when a user is signed in.</p><p>Teen creators lose access to their dashboards and can’t manage or update their channels. Their content stays online, but they can’t touch it again until their 16th birthday.</p><p>YouTube says none of this data is deleted; it’s simply frozen, waiting for teens to age back into their own profiles.</p><h2 id="google-claims-it-s-unsafe-2">Google claims it's unsafe</h2><p>However, it is important to note a critical distinction: the ban restricts account access, not access to the entire YouTube site. Young users can still view videos as guests, but lose all personalized features provided by an account, such as subscriptions and recommendations.</p><p>Google’s argument is straightforward. By forcing kids to use YouTube without an account, the ban removes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/minimum-streaming-age-youtube-requirement-increases-parents-details">safety measures</a> built over the last decade. Rachel Lord, a senior public policy manager at Google, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/intl/en-au/products/whats-changing-on-youtube-in-australia/" target="_blank">called</a> the regulation "rushed" and warned that it will "make Australian kids less safe on YouTube."</p><p>On the flip side, the Australian government isn't buying it. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/youtube-says-it-will-comply-with-australias-teen-social-media-ban-2025-12-03/" target="_blank">Reuters</a> reports that Communications Minister Anika Wells fired back, noting that if YouTube is admitting its platform is unsafe for signed-out users, "that’s a problem that YouTube needs to fix."</p> ]]></dc:content>

The South Korean OEM's video is rather short, only coming in at 30 seconds, but this brief clip offers a subtle glimpse into what we might expect. Samsung opens its teaser by stating, "In silence, we listened," likely referring to the various grievances Galaxy users have had over the years with its Exynos chips.</p><p>The company then goes on to make two big, dare we say, promises about the upcoming Exynos chip.</p><p>Samsung says the Exynos 2600 has been "refined at the core," before rolling into another statement stating optimizations have arrived "at every level." The company is really trying to stoke the hype flames this year with the Exynos 2600, adding that the new chip is designed to "express the exceptional" in its devices, and likely its users. Unfortunately, Samsung doesn't offer anything with more substance about the chip, like something we can really dig into.</p><p>However, the company's description box held more, as it says, "The next Exynos is coming." Samsung highlights that the chip is "coming soon," which might feed into the rumors that it will be placed into the Galaxy S26.</p><h2 id="will-it-be-different-this-time-2">Will it be different this time?</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7jfpNre0JGA" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>We've been going through Exynos 2600 rumors like nobody's business, but they claim one thing: that it's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-may-feature-an-exynos-chip-that-outpaces-apple-and-qualcomm">going to be snappy</a>. Rumors in October make the claim that Samsung's new in-house chip will thrust it into contention with chips from Apple and Qualcomm. Supposedly, the company has taken strides to improve the speed of the Exynos 2600, producing a snappier and graphically stronger SoC for its Galaxy phones.</p><p>We've also heard repeated rumors that the chip is built on Samsung's 2nm process, not 3nm, which you'd get from TSMC for Qualcomm's Snapdragon. AI was another object of discussion, as Samsung will look to really force its AI software onto the Exynos 2600, improving its performance to "surpass" Apple.</p><p>Just last month, it was speculated that Samsung's Exynos 2600 could <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-custom-exynos-chip-might-bring-its-galaxy-s26-series-price-down">bring a small price drop</a> to the chip's target series: the Galaxy S26. Supposedly, the regions that could see the chip (Korea, Europe) might see a ~$20 to ~$30 price drop. There were reportedly concerns about the chip's true power potential on smartphones, despite Samsung rocking its 2nm process.</p><p>Performance has always been a concern with Samsung's Exynos chip; just look at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-fe-exynos-2500-impact-rumors">the struggles it had</a> with its 2500 series. There's also the fact that Samsung, when it does utilize its Exynos chip, shies away from a U.S. Galaxy launch with the chip due to market perception, as most lean toward Qualcomm's Snapdragon.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Google has quietly removed the “Call Home” button, a beloved feature that allowed you to ring your smart displays directly from your phone.</p><p>Introduced in 2019, the feature made it easy to call a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-smart-display">smart display</a> in the house without needing extra phone numbers or apps. Many parents used it to check in on kids while running errands.</p><p>Now, when users open the Google Home app, the familiar button that used to appear above “Broadcast” is missing. One parent shared their frustration about this change on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/1pbdwua/call_home_feature_gone_from_google_home_app/" target="_blank">Reddit</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-call-home-quietly-gone-3621613/" target="_blank">Android Authority</a>). We can confirm that the "Call Home" button is gone from our Home app.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:406px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.29%;"><img id="56VFHfvjVYoGVZ6Hv3sVP4" name="Google-Home-app-favorites" alt="Google Home app favorites tab showing the broadcast button at the top" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/56VFHfvjVYoGVZ6Hv3sVP4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="406" height="870" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The frustration bubbling up across Reddit makes it clear how disruptive this change is. Owners report that the feature was woven into their daily routines, and losing it felt like Google cutting functionality from products people already paid for.</p><p>Google has not explained the change, and support teams are only telling users to send feedback.</p><p>Speculation points to Google’s broader smart-home overhaul, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-home-app-gemini-integration">especially with the new Gemini integration</a> and changes to the Home app. But without an official statement, it’s just a guess.</p><h2 id="the-workaround-is-clunky-2">The workaround is clunky</h2><p>The current alternatives aren’t great. You can set up Google Meet calling on Nest devices, but it requires assigning unique Google accounts and jumping through setup steps most households won’t bother with. It works, technically, but it’s nothing like the simple, friction-free Call Home button people relied on for years.</p><p>This change seems like another example of Google making its services simpler but at the expense of features people are used to. We have seen similar changes before, like when <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-tasks-integration-is-arriving-for-keep-to-replace-reminders">Google Keep reminders moved to Tasks</a>.</p><p>Now, the question is whether Google will bring back this feature in a new form or if it is gone for good. Until Google releases a statement, Nest owners have to find workarounds or rethink their smart-home setup.</p> ]]></dc:content>
