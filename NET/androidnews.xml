While this still won't match the blazing speeds of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> or Chinese flagships like the Xiaomi 17 Ultra or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/i-took-the-find-x9-pro-to-mexico-its-cameras-are-on-another-level-entirely">Oppo Find X9 Pro</a>, it's still a welcome improvement. Now, a new leak suggests that wireless charging speeds will also get a boost.</p><p>According to a report from Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.etnews.com/20251111000219">ET News</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1988127441794330697">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>), Samsung is planning to equip the Galaxy S26 Ultra with up to 25W fast wireless charging. The baseline Galaxy S26 and Galaxy S26 Plus are expected to get upgrades too, reportedly supporting up to 20W wireless charging.</p><h2 id="samsung-could-raise-both-wired-and-wireless-speeds-2">Samsung could raise both wired and wireless speeds</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="sreYeTQmDmzkNpN9VZ236V" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-bottom-01" alt="A close-up of the bottom ports on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sreYeTQmDmzkNpN9VZ236V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Previously, all Galaxy models supported up to 15W wireless charging, but the report claims all upcoming models will feature faster speeds next year. This would mark the first time in nearly six years that Samsung has upgraded wireless charging speeds, which would certainly be a welcome change.</p><p>It's not yet known whether the phones will support Qi2 charging speeds (which offer up to 25W maximum) or include a built-in magnetic ring similar to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide">Pixel 10 series</a>. However, given Samsung recently <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">introduced its own MagSafe-style chargers</a>, it's likely we'll see both Qi2 magnets and faster charging supported.</p><p>Plenty has leaked about the Galaxy S26 series in recent weeks. The lineup was initially rumored for a February 2026 launch, but a recent leak suggests it will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-series-might-arrive-jan-2025">arrive in late January instead</a>. We also got our <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/leaked-cad-renders-give-first-look-at-samsung-galaxy-s26-plus-design">first look at the Galaxy S26 Plus</a> after Samsung reportedly dropped the Galaxy S26 Edge in favor of the Plus model due to weak sales of the S25 Edge.</p><p>A lot could still change before the official launch in about two months, but we are finally starting to see the Galaxy S26 series take shape.</p> ]]></dc:content>

One of the most surprising offers I've seen comes from Verizon, which will give you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/"><strong>a free Samsung Galaxy S25, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Galaxy Tab if you bundle the three devices</strong></a> and add respective service lines. </p><p>No trade-in is required, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/best-verizon-phone-deals-plans">Verizon</a> won't even force you to use the most expensive data plans to receive the savings. Even lower-priced tiers like Verizon's myPlan and the Unlimited Welcome plan will land you the three free Samsung devices, just be sure to add all three items to the same cart. Only new customers and existing Verizon customers who add a new line with a port-in are eligible for the deal, but if you can make it work for you, it's almost like getting all of your holiday shopping done at once! </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><em><strong>See the full list of Black Friday deals at Verizon</strong></em></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:502px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:106.97%;"><img id="qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR" name="samsung-galaxy-phone-tab-watch-bundle-render.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qVDakRZaDJo6VZFZcF8dxR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="502" height="537" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Verizon Black Friday Bundle: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s25/" data-dimension112="b266e783-390d-4816-b5d9-1e9236f21fa4" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension48="Verizon Black Friday Bundle: Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines" data-dimension25=""><strong>Get a free Galaxy S25, Watch, and Tab with eligible service lines</strong></a></p><p>Just in time for Black Friday, Verizon is running a deal that will get you a free <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Samsung Galaxy S25</a>, Galaxy Watch 8, AND a Samsung tablet, and all you need to do is pay for the new data plans.

The free devices included in the deal are some of the best that Samsung has to offer. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-review">Galaxy S25</a>, for instance, is powered by the ultra-efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, plus you get 12GB of RAM, seven years of software support, and all of the latest Galaxy AI software features. </p><p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch/samsung-galaxy-watch-8-review">Galaxy Watch 8</a> is no slouch either, coming complete with a stylish, ultra-comfy design, Wear OS 6, and a suite of comprehensive health and fitness tracking features. Not interested in these devices? Verizon is also running similar bundle deals for Apple and Pixel, so take your pick. Needless to say, Black Friday is sure to come with a multitude of excellent Android deals in tow, but if you don't want to wait, Verizon has you covered. </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-2">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Make sure to <a href="https://www.google.com/preferences/source?q=androidcentral.com" target="_blank"><strong>set Android Central as a preferred source</strong></a> in Google Search, and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ask-jerry-how-to-curate-your-google-news-search-and-why-you-should"><strong>find out why you should</strong></a> so that you can stay up-to-date on the latest news, reviews, features, and more.</p><p>Google just dropped its month update for Pixels and this seems to be feature loaded. The tech giant announced that a whole host of features is coming to Pixel 6 to the Pixel 10 series.</p><p>The update brings a mix of fresh AI tools, safety upgrades, and a themed makeover inspired by Wicked. Whether you’re rocking an older Pixel or the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, there’s something in here to play with.</p><p>One of the standout additions is Remix in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-messages-first-things-to-do">Google Messages</a>, a creative new feature powered by Google’s Gemini Nano Banana model. It lets you reimagine photos inside a chat. You and your friends can pass the same image back and forth, tweaking and remixing it without ever leaving the conversation.</p><p>The feature launches first for RCS users in English-speaking countries including the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, India, Ireland, and New Zealand.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.48%;"><img id="PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG" name="Pixel-Drop-Google-Messages-Remix" alt="Remix in Google Messages showing a dog with various AI-generated versions" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PnRxq5BeNa5uCA6jQhhxcG.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1046" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><h2 id="wicked-themed-customization-2">Wicked-themed customization</h2><p>If you're fond of customization, there’s the new “Wicked: For Good” theme pack. Available for Pixel 6 and above until January 31, 2026, it dresses your phone in Wicked-inspired wallpapers, icons, sounds, and GIFs — with themes based on Glinda, Elphaba, and For Good.</p><p>Pixel users will also get some useful quality-of-life improvements. Notification Summaries, coming to Pixel 9 and newer (except the 9a), automatically condense long group chats into quick recaps right in your notification shade. A follow-up feature arriving in December promises to take things further by automatically quieting less important alerts, helping you focus on what matters.</p><h2 id="scam-protection-gets-tougher-2">Scam protection gets tougher</h2><p>On the security front, Scam Detection for messages can now flag suspicious chat notifications in popular apps on Pixel 6 and newer models. It checks message content and shows a “Likely scam” alert before you open the app. Google is also expanding call scam detection, which listens for scam-like speech during calls, to more regions like the UK, Ireland, India, Australia, and Canada.</p><p>For Pixel 9 and newer, Call Notes is also expanding internationally. The feature uses on-device AI to record and summarize calls, turning them into searchable notes with action items, making follow-ups less of a chore.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5739jzRC6N2xzgfNPxxLpb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Google Maps power saving mode showing minimal interface during navigation" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ALjyZgYFrq2vCbZpgtfrfb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:54.00%;"><img id="LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LiGGrojEpAFfNrzLiakDrb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 4</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb" name="November-Pixel-Drop-features" alt="Pixel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/krULDBviXgNKFpsi9PxLwb.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Google Photos is also getting Personalized Edits.

I've had a question all this time: how do you guys decide what is worth writing about? I don't mean news and updated information because that's a given. I mean, the other content about what you all like or what you think needs to change. </strong></em></p><p><em><strong>Surely you're not just writing what you want, and there has to be some sort of process. If you can share anything about it, I think it would be very interesting.</strong></em></p><p>Hi Jane, thanks for the interesting question. It's nice to step away from wires and tubes and things that go beep every now and then.</p><p>I'm going to preface this by saying this is about <strong>me</strong>. We're all writers and Android enthusiasts here at Android Central, but more importantly, we're individuals. We each have our own process of getting an idea from the back corner of our mind onto the web's virtual paper.</p><p>I'll also skip some obvious things. If there is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/news">news</a> out there, it will get written because people want to read it. The same goes for announcements from the companies that build all this stuff; when Samsung or Motorola has something to share, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">it's always worth sharing</a>.</p><p>Once we're past that part, things are a little more free-form. The most important thing to me is that <strong>we</strong> care about something (we, meaning both you, the reader, and I). I could spend all day writing about fishing poles or how to change the spark plugs on a Volkswagen, but would you read it?</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The second most important thing is that I have a clue. I don't write about finances, for example, because I don't follow how much companies are earning or spending, as it holds no interest to me. Anything I would write wouldn't be nearly as interesting as it would be if someone enthusiastic about the subject tackled it. We both deserve better.</p><p>Finally, some of my interests are tech-adjacent but not really a great fit for an Android website. I love DIY and project electronics, so the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/raspberry-pi">Raspberry Pi</a> is one of my favorite products. I'll occasionally share a great deal with you, but I don't have the time to spend explaining how to use it and build a smart device or a reef aquarium controller. Or even a phone. I know, because I've done it, and very few people read it.</p><p>When all the dust settles, I hope I can share some information that's interesting and helpful. Helping people is important to me.</p><h2 id="we-write-about-what-we-love-2">We write about what we love</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN" name="linux-on-pixelbook-go-16x9.jpg" alt="Linux terminal on Pixelbook Go" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hiofJ5eS93tG6WTpCKssnN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jerry Hildenbrand / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Within reason, of course.</p><p>If you take a minute to notice it, you'll find that the writers here have an obvious love of different things. When the right person writes about something like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">VR glasses</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/sunday-runday">health and fitness</a>, it shows, and the articles are exceptional.</p><p>I'm not interested in how a company is building the next generation of super microprocessor that can power things 30% faster. I'm curious about optimizing the existing software to make it more efficient and run 30% faster than it currently does. Without the software, all these gadgets are just a hunk of metal and wires.</p><p>I'm also super interested in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-chromebook">Chromebooks</a>. They have the potential to do anything and everything with the right infrastructure, yet they're often dirt cheap. A powerful product that's accessible to everyone beats a $5,000 MacBook every time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1299px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:49.96%;"><img id="VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ" name="Android-Central-columns" alt="A list of some Android Central columns" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VH3fnBtYZxXpXdaf4nd2KJ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1299" height="649" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>It's a little off the beaten track, but I want to try to do my part in holding all these companies accountable, too. Google, Apple, Samsung, and others provide us with the products we love, often making our lives easier. But there is always a cost, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-vs-disney-when-big-companies-fight-consumers-lose">things need to be equitable</a>. If you're forced to give up more than something is worth, or when these seemingly above-the-rules tech companies are out of line, I want to mention it. And there's always plenty of that going on.</p><p>Finally, there is the whole Apple thing. "<em>Who cares about Apple? This is an Android website!</em>" is something I get to hear all of the time. Here's an answer: <strong>I care about Apple</strong>. I also care about Microsoft and Amazon. These companies are driving and shaping the future of our tech. I'll never use an iPhone; I tried it, hated it (though I think the older Mac Mini was the best PC ever). When Apple makes a change to the iPhone that affects consumers or consumer technology in general, that's important, particularly because of the sheer number of people using the product.</p><h2 id="we-re-a-service-provider-2">We're a service provider</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1067px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN" name="Lenovo Tab M11 lifestyle" alt="Lenovo Tab M11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rMBmQxWTmVoB7xjzPDAZkN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1067" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Lenovo)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of the day, we're here for you.

For example, buyers can get the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank"><strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus for $100 off during Amazon's early Black Friday sale</strong></a> right now, bringing the price down to just under $300.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Moto G Stylus comes with a stylus included. It also features a 6.7-inch pOLED screen, as well as both a regular and ultrawide camera lens. Like most Motorola phones, it also features the vegan leather, anti-slip backing, and the latest edition of the phone comes with a MIL-STD-810H durability rating, meaning that it's rated even for military standard durability. It also comes with an IP68 water and dust resistance rating, so it can definitely take a bit of a beating if you're looking for something particularly strong and waterproof.</p><p>This particular deal is for the 256GB storage version of the phone, while both configurations sport 8GB of RAM and a powerful Snapdragon CPU.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/moto-g-stylus-2025-vs-moto-g-stylus-5g-2024">Compared to the 2024 Moto G Stylus</a>, the 2025 comes with some key design improvements, including the aforementioned IP and durability ratings. It also boasts a slightly better suite of cameras, faster charging speeds, higher wireless standards, and some of the latest Motorola software features available. While it doesn't usually go on sale as much as the 2024 version, this is a solid price for those hoping to get a newer release.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>Check out our ultimate guide to Amazon's early Black Friday deals!</strong></a></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1112px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:115.83%;"><img id="8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm" name="motorola-moto-g-stylus-2025-product-image.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8MUigJMAtb2rabW3B3tdvm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1112" height="1288" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Motorola Moto G Stylus (2025):</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Moto-Stylus-Unlocked-Gibraltar/dp/B0DWV55DXH" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$399.99" data-dimension48="$399.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$399.99</del> <strong>$299.99 at Amazon for the Early Black Friday sale</strong></a></p><p>Amazon's early Black Friday sale has cut 25% off the price of this year's Motorola Moto G Stylus, marking $100 in savings.

It also has the luxurious-feeling vegan leather back that Motorola buyers love, along with a headphone jack, a 50MP wide lens and a 13MP ultrawide, in addition to a 32MP front camera. This phone can also charge at speeds of up to 68W, in contrast with the 30W offered with the 2024 version.</p><p>Interestingly enough, Motorola only launched this year's Moto G Stylus with two vaguely blue colors, dubbed Gibraltar Sea and Surf the Web.

                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Over the years, one of my biggest complaints about foldable phones has been that while many of these have all of the bells and whistles, they usually fall short in the camera department. When you spend between $1,500 and $2,000+ on a phone, you would expect it to feature the best hardware across the board, but that simply hasn't been the case.</p><p>Even with how drastic an overhaul the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-one-year-later">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> received last year, it still didn't offer the same camera features as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-review">Pixel 9 Pro</a>. Sadly, this is also the case with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>, as the camera hardware is practically identical to its predecessor.</p><p>Enjoy our content?

Not to mention that foldable phones that are available abroad, such as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Oppo Find N5</a>, usually don't suffer from the same issues, at least not usually.</p><p>With that, I ventured out and took a bunch of pictures with all four foldable phones in an effort to see how well the Pixel 10 Pro Fold compared. Before we get into the nitty-gritty, I want to note that all of the pictures you see were taken with the default settings. The images were not manipulated in any way to provide the most balanced comparison possible.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7"><span>Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2BGrrFpboUdovnBzoVz4MA" name="pixel-10-pro-fold-vs-galaxy-z-fold-7-1" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold vs. Galaxy Z Fold 7 camera comparisons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2BGrrFpboUdovnBzoVz4MA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We'll kick off this camera showdown with the two phones that many are likely considering as we head into the holiday season. It's also an interesting comparison because while Google didn't really do much in the way of upgrades, Samsung took the opposite approach with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-camera-comparison">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a>. However, even with the new 200MP sensor, I'm not sure that it's really all <em>that much</em> better than the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>Right off the bat, we get the patented Samsung saturation, albeit not as pronounced as I've become accustomed to. It's saturated enough to notice compared to the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but it's not like the picture looks bad by any means.

The extended battery life alone is worth the splurge. It's perfect for vacations and trips where you need to take lots of pictures and videos but have battery anxiety.</p><p>Additionally, since you can turn the wireless charging off on the Belkin camera stand power bank, it also helps you conserve its power instead of wasting it unnecessarily. The built-in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">Type-C cable</a> can get awkward to use, but it's so convenient to have. You don't have to worry about packing a separate cable.</p><p>At $36.99, the KraftGeek PowerShutter is an absolute steal. It's a fantastic alternative to the more premium Belkin Stage PowerGrip. However, if you can afford to spend another $43, the $79.99 Belkin option will make you a lot happier!</p><p>Bonus tip: If you really want the Belkin Stage PowerGrip but are counting the change you found in your couch, just wait for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> to grab a good deal on it.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="fbd705e0-0de2-4342-8cb0-d77ac1bac2c4">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7rFzrde4WMTrbhhtDfqpPU.jpg' alt="Belkin Stage PowerGrip"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Belkin Stage PowerGrip</div>                                <div class="stars__reviews"><span itemprop="reviewRating" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Rating" class="chunk rating"><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star"> </span><span class="icon icon-star half"></span><meta itemprop="bestRating" content="100.0" /><meta itemprop="worstRating" content="0.0" /><meta itemprop="ratingValue" content="70" /></span></div>                </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>High capacity, high cost</strong></em></p><p>Looking for the perfect photography-friendly power bank for your MagSafe or Qi2 phone?

Arriving this week, OPPO says owners of a Find N3, Find N3 Flip, or a Find N3 Pad 3 Pro can expect the major Android OS upgrade to begin on November 11.</p><p>Moreover, the company is stacking its update rollout schedule, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-x8-pro-review">Find X8 Pro</a>, and the Find X8 have already started receiving it, as of November 6.</p><p>OPPO states that while these dates are when it will begin pushing the update, consumers shouldn't expect it that day (but if it arrives, then lovely!). The community post says that ColorOS 16 is rolling out "in batches," meaning that it could take a few days to a few weeks before <em>everyone </em>receives it. The main takeaway here is that ColorOS 16 should at least hit your phone or foldable or tablet at some point in November.</p><p>OPPO's ColorOS 16 update closely mirrors what OnePlus folks <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-oxygenos-16-arrives-as-a-software-that-truly-knows-you">got with OxygenOS 16</a>.

The folks at 9to5 mention that the company's tablets, the Pad 3 and Pad 2, have since started receiving the major upgrade.</p><p>Just before the weekend, OnePlus <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-12-gets-its-promised-android-16-update-on-schedule-with-open-foldable">started rolling out the update</a> to the OnePlus 12 and the Open foldable. The patch was announced for users in India first; however, it's expected to soon spread across to more regions as we move through November. Among the highlights, OxygenOS 16 brings a revamped UI experience that's designed to be much smoother and fluid than before.</p><p>OnePlus states it's reworked its visuals, as well as refreshed apps, AI, and more. The Mind Assistant, hitting the OnePlus 12, is capable of getting you to your saved content even faster. Even the past-gen device's camera is receiving some updates, as the company introduces better controls to help users get those creative juices flowing and into reality.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The app is a universal hub for location sharing and tracking of items, devices, and people. In the latest Find Hub app update on the Google Play Store, Google adds a redesigned account menu and dedicated toggle for units of distance measurement.</p><p>The new Find Hub app update is version 3.1.458, and starting to roll out as of Monday, Nov. 10. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/10/find-hub-device-list/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a> spotted the updated Find Hub app that includes a <strong>Distance units </strong>menu for the first time. Here, users can customize the unit of measurement Find Hub uses to display distance and location data.</p><p>The fresh menu has four choices available, including a <strong>Use default</strong> setting that will follow your Android device's system setting. The other <strong>Distance units</strong> menu options are <strong>Metric</strong>, <strong>U.S.</strong>, and <strong>U.K.</strong> You can find the menu page in the <strong>Settings</strong> section of the Find Hub app.</p><p>Additionally, the Find Hub app update includes a fullscreen Google account menu. This tweak has previously rolled out to most other Google apps, including Google Messages and the Google Play Store. Users can open it by pressing their Google account profile picture in the Find Hub app.</p><p>While some users are seeing Find Hub v3.1.458 now, it appears to be a slow rollout.</p><h2 id="google-updates-its-list-of-supported-find-hub-trackers-and-more-2">Google updates its list of supported Find Hub trackers and more</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="2kQ8hfyB9rqN2pT49KiSvR" name="find-device-5.jpg" alt="Find My Device phone page showcasing location details" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2kQ8hfyB9rqN2pT49KiSvR.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In a separate move, Google also updated its Find Hub <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.android.com/learn-find-hub/compatible-devices/" target="_blank">compatible devices page</a> on the web.

Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><p>Often, it's good to take a step back and see what's inside that pretty package. Was it worth what you paid for it? Will you get enough use from it to justify the purchase? Or maybe you should hold off and see what's coming next.</p><p>We can't make those decisions for you, but we can tell you what we think and maybe where you should start your decision-making process.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Early Black Friday sales</a> are already here, and we'll see even more in the next few weeks.

You will find great deals at places like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/walmart-black-friday">Walmart</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-buy-black-friday">Best Buy</a>, too, but Amazon has a gazillion tech products, and it seems like they all get a Black Friday deal worth looking at.</p><p>Some of the best deals will be for Amazon's own products, like an Echo or the Fire line of tablets. It seems that Amazon is willing to lose money selling these because the company knows they will encourage you to use Amazon services more. That's not a bad strategy if your company can afford it, and Amazon certainly can.</p><p>But let's be honest: these products aren't for everyone. They are only worth buying if they are something you'll use. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-and-nest-are-making-smart-home-feel-smarter-matter">Google's Nest</a> line of smart home products is, in my opinion, miles ahead of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-echo-flex-review">Amazon's Echo and Alexa</a>. But if you <em>use</em> Alexa, the Echo is a much better buy. And plenty of people do.</p><p>Before you buy anything, you should ignore the deal and the low price and ask yourself if you'll use it.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-what-makes-the-fire-tablet-a-good-fit"><span>What makes the Fire Tablet a good fit?</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1775px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="NAoRynxHhVPTNCv3xvni5m" name="amazon-fire-hd-10-plus-docked.jpg" alt="Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus using Show Mode in Dock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NAoRynxHhVPTNCv3xvni5m.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1775" height="998" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is no right way or wrong way to use a tablet, but there are different ways to use one.</p><p>If you want a bigger screen with longer battery life to consume, Amazon's Fire tablets might be for you. Especially if you're already (or thinking of becoming) an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-share-amazon-prime-friends-and-family">Amazon Prime</a> subscriber.</p><p>You can watch movies, TV shows, and videos on any modern tablet, even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/amazon-prime-video-getting-shuffle-button-too">Amazon's Prime Video</a> offerings. But if this is your primary use case, like it is for a lot of folks, then a new Fire HD makes it easy, and you'll have a lot of money left to buy more and more of that content. You aren't missing anything; you don't need a stupid-crazy powerful Apple processor or a world-class Samsung display to watch a movie on the couch. You need quick and easy access to the content, and Amazon offers it.</p><p>What about the kids? I think <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-kindle-fire-tablet">Amazon's Fire Kids tablets</a> are one of the best things a parent can buy for their child. I will say that there is nothing you can do with one that can't be done on something like a Galaxy Tab or a OnePlus tablet, but the parental controls over what the kiddos have access to are dead simple on the Fire Kids versions. Simple means <em><strong>you'll do it</strong></em>, keeping the things you don't want your kids to see away. Until they get smart enough to work around it all anyway.</p><p>There are a few gray areas, too. Gaming is a big one. If you want the best gaming experience or love to play intense and demanding games, the Fire isn't the best way to do it. If you want to play more mobile-style games or the kids want to play <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/android-game-review-minecraft-pocket-edition">Minecraft</a>, well, the Fire tablet is a winner because it's more than adequate and usually about one-third of the price.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-don-t-buy-a-fire-tab-and-expect-everything"><span>Don't buy a Fire Tab and expect everything</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg" name="samsung-galaxy-chromebook-plus-review-18.jpg" alt="Help me write in Google Docs on Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7toEJcBHissLb7zzLyXyUg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of course, there are things the Fire Tab isn't good at doing. When it comes to productivity, things like working with spreadsheets or doing homework, nothing beats a good Android tablet. And yes, I say that as an iPad user. Don't be shocked, I use what fits me best.</p><p>A good Galaxy Tab or even a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/forget-what-you-may-have-heard-chromebooks-are-actually-great-productivity-machines">Chromebook</a> with a great touchscreen is the way to get work done because the software is there.

Wake locks allow apps to keep your device’s CPU awake, even when the screen is off, to run background tasks. While some wake locks are necessary, like playing music or completing app downloads, others can silently drain your battery.</p><p>The new system is meant to pinpoint apps that hold more than two cumulative hours of non-exempt wake locks in a 24-hour period as excessive. If 5% of an app’s user sessions over the last 28 days fall into this category, the app is considered to have bad battery behavior.</p><p>For users, this means apps that were quietly draining battery in the background could soon be flagged directly in their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-play-download-manage-apps">Google Play Store</a> listing page.</p><h2 id="play-store-public-shame-2">Play Store public shame</h2><p>Starting March 1, 2026, apps that exceed this threshold may have reduced visibility on “prominent discovery surfaces,” such as recommendations. More importantly for users, Google will place a red warning label on app listings that reads: “This app may use more battery than expected due to high background activity.”</p><p>This warning will hopefully make it clear which apps might be the culprits behind unexpected battery drain, so users can take actions like adjusting permissions, restricting background activity, or choosing alternatives.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:802px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:89.65%;"><img id="ZXDQVBJrBniNKMzae2xWLe" name="Play-Store-warning-for-battery-draining-apps" alt="Play Store warning highlighting a battery-draining app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZXDQVBJrBniNKMzae2xWLe.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="802" height="719" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google developed the metric in collaboration with Samsung, combining real-world device data and insights into user experience to make the algorithm as accurate as possible.</p><p>As time goes on, users should see fewer apps keeping their <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> awake for no reason, better performance, and less unexpected battery drain. Even before the March deadline, this new metric gives users a warning about apps with high background activity, helping them make better choices.</p><p>Hopefully, apps will be encouraged to use less background activity, and users will finally get a better look at what’s happening on their phones.

According to a new rumor, the company is working on a phone with a 240Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Launched in China last month, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a> features a 165Hz refresh rate and a 1.5K display, which is a noticeable change from the previous model’s 2K, 120Hz screen. As a result, the phone is getting attention for its strong performance and reasonable price, although some fans view the lower resolution as a downgrade. It is said that OnePlus may have reduced the resolution to make motion smoother.</p><p>The discussion heats up after the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/OnePlusClub/status/1987144850471604482" target="_blank">OnePlus Club</a> account on X claimed the company wants to find a “perfect balance” between high resolution and a 240Hz dynamic refresh rate in future phones.</p><p>There’s no official word yet on which model will get this high-refresh screen, but rumors suggest it could be the OnePlus 16 or 17.</p><p>The idea of a 240Hz refresh rate is getting mixed reactions online, as indicated by the responses to OnePlus Club’s X post. Some people wonder if it’s really the upgrade users need at the moment, since most apps and videos won’t use it, while others think it could make gaming and scrolling much smoother than ever before.</p><h2 id="the-inevitable-compromise-2">The inevitable compromise</h2><p>There are trade-offs, of course, if this idea becomes a reality. A 240Hz display would most likely use more power and reduce battery life, even if it makes motion look smoother. Some critics say OnePlus should focus on better cameras or longer battery life instead of just increasing the refresh rate, and this is echoed by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/1okm81s/im_getting_mixed_feelings_on_the_brand_new_15s/" target="_blank">people on Reddit</a> who’ve found the OnePlus 15 camera lacking in many ways.</p><p>On the other hand, our own Nicholas Sutrich <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-photo-samples">liked the phone's shooters in his first impression</a>, noting that the new DetailMax Engine seems to fix the aggressive Hasselblad processing with the OnePlus 13.</p><p>Even so, the thought of almost instant response times for gaming, app use, and swiping is appealing, and it could set a new standard for high-performance phone screens.</p><p>It’s still unclear if people will like this feature or see it as an overkill. What’s certain is that OnePlus seems to be willing to try new things with display technology, even if it means rethinking usual priorities like resolution and battery life.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tech giant is bringing its Gemini-like modern redesign to this feature after what seems like forever.</p><p>What was once four multicolored dots is now going to look a lot like its Live Search UI, but with some changes to animation and the overall response from the Search bot (as reported by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/07/google-voice-search-redesign/">9to5 Google</a>).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1464px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:51.64%;"><img id="8ru4aQXqcyQXgogzGQSjth" name="Google-Voice-search-redesign" alt="Google voice search redesign" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8ru4aQXqcyQXgogzGQSjth.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1464" height="756" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As you can see in the GIF below, the ‘G’ logo is a lot more centered now, and the “What’s on your mind?” prompt transitions into the transcript. The earlier compact waveform has been replaced by an arc that vibrates with speech. The "search a song" prompt remains at the bottom of the screen, and once users click on it, the words "Play, Sing, Hum" take over the center part of the screen as opposed to the circular orb that would move based on your voice.</p><p>Additionally, Google has also changed the sound associated with the search feature. The sound for an active microphone, which used to be a "ping," has been changed to match the sound used for voice search on AI Mode.</p><p>The tech giant seems to be aiming at keeping the UI more consistent and easier to understand. This update shows a focus on refining the user interface, making even small details contribute to a more unified Google experience.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:201.88%;"><img id="xfgJpCL7hzS9xvzruc2nDH" name="Google-Voice-search-redesign" alt="Nandika Ravi/Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xfgJpCL7hzS9xvzruc2nDH.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="1615" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The newly redesigned interface for the Google app is being rolled out gradually to Android and iOS users alike.

A new leak suggests Samsung is reworking parts of the phone’s design, particularly the front camera, but not necessarily in a way everyone will cheer for.</p><p>The latest rumored change is a larger front-facing camera cutout, possibly about 4mm wide, according to leaker <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987865298242818269" target="_blank">@UniverseIce on X</a>. If true, this would be the largest Infinity-O hole ever on a Samsung Ultra model, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-s26-ultra-could-have-the-widest-infinity-o-camera-cutout-yet/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a> points out.</p><p>As per the leaker, the change is supposedly meant to accommodate a wider field of view, increasing from about 80 degrees on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-review">Galaxy S25 Ultra</a> to roughly 85 degrees. In theory, that means you’ll be able to fit even more into your selfies or group shots without stretching your arm as far.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:680px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:96.91%;"><img id="TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3" name="Galaxy-S26-Ultra-front-camera-cutout" alt="side by side comparison of the front camera cutout on the Galaxy S25 Ultra (right) and S26 Ultra (left)" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TBmmGQMMv3etnRK4Uj6AW3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="680" height="659" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @UniverseIce / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, the actual front camera hardware might not see any real upgrades. The resolution and sensor could stay the same as before, meaning you’ll get a wider frame but not necessarily a better image overall.</p><p>This change shows a curious change to Samsung’s design approach. For years, Samsung has made its punch-hole cameras smaller to create a more immersive display. Now, the Galaxy S26 Ultra might be moving in the opposite direction.</p><h2 id="rear-camera-tweaks-2">Rear camera tweaks</h2><p>For the rear cameras, Samsung seems to be making small improvements instead of big changes. The S26 Ultra is said to retain the same 200MP main camera and 50MP ultra-wide lens as the S25 Ultra.</p><p>The telephoto system might change a bit, with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-leak-points-to-a-sweet-camera-upgrade-for-your-close-up-shots">3x telephoto lens</a> possibly using a new 12MP ISOCELL S5K3LD sensor instead of the older IMX754, as per the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1986626916661731732" target="_blank">tipster</a>. While this sounds like an upgrade, the new sensor is actually smaller at 1/3.94" compared to 1/3.52", which could slightly reduce how much light it captures.</p><p>The 5x periscope zoom could get a wider aperture, changing from f/3.4 to f/2.9, which should help with low-light photos. There are also rumors about a new APV video codec that might make videos more efficient and higher quality, but this is still unconfirmed.</p><p>An <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987135260321325060" target="_blank">earlier rumor</a> claims the Galaxy S26 Ultra may look slimmer and include <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">Qi2 wireless charging</a>, but the larger Infinity-O cutout will likely be more noticeable. Samsung usually prefers symmetry and minimalism in its designs, so some people might see this larger punch-hole as a negative move.</p> ]]></dc:content>

If the rumors are true, Samsung has multiple prototype design in the works for models like the base Galaxy S26. The company was said to be working on a Galaxy S26 Pro model with an enhanced feature set, but the latest leaks indicate Samsung is playing it safe instead, opting to release a regular Galaxy S26 instead.</p><p>The developing situation is resulting in rumors and leaks that each paint different pictures. Last week, a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26</a> rumor claimed the upcoming smartphone would be considerably thinner than the current Samsung Galaxy S25. The reported thickness was 6.96mm, and 10.23mm including the camera bump. Now, an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-specs" target="_blank">Android Headlines</a> report claims the latest prototype is 7.24mm thick.</p><p>The exact dimensions of the Galaxy S26 prototype are said to be 149.5 x 71.6 x 7.24mm. Compared to the report from last week, this new Galaxy S26 prototype is wider, taller, and thicker. Notably, the latest Galaxy S26 prototype appears much thicker than the previously-rumored figure, but it's only marginally thicker than the 7.2mm Galaxy S25.</p><p>There aren't any pictures or renderings of the updated Galaxy S26 design available at the moment. We don't know whether this will be the final revision, but as the Galaxy S26's expected launch window creeps closer, it becomes more likely. Following conflicting reports of a delayed launch, it looks like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">the Galaxy S26 series will debut in late January</a>.</p><h2 id="samsung-is-still-planning-to-finally-include-qi2-magnets-2">Samsung is still planning to finally include Qi2 magnets</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4026px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-review-11" alt="Galaxy S25 Plus with a case on and an ESR Qi2 charger attached to the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7TYgWGKtnE8xQ5ZxzH62hV.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4026" height="2265" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Android manufacturers are tweaking the designs of their smartphones to stay competitive as the Qi2 era finally begins. MagSafe has been standard on iPhones for half a decade, but the Qi2 equivalent only became mainstream on Android with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Google Pixel 10</a>. Now, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-launches-qi2-chargers-in-the-us">it's Samsung's turn to respond</a>, and it might be tweaking the Galaxy S26 design to accommodate internal magnets.</p><p>It's unclear what exactly led Samsung to allegedly change the Galaxy S26's design. It could be the inclusion of Qi2 magnets, or something else entirely. As Android Headlines notes, the updated prototype has a thicker camera bump, so it could have something to do with the camera modules themselves.</p><p>Either way, if these leaks pan out, the Galaxy S26 will add Qi2 magnets while only gaining 0.04mm of thickness compared to the Galaxy S25.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While I wasn't that keen on the design initially, it has proven to be easier to hold and use, and the weight distribution is ideal. What I'm particularly liking is the battery life, thanks to the huge 7,500mAh battery, the phone manages to last a day and a half even with heavy use.</p><p>It's the cameras that make the Find X9 Pro truly stand out. In my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro review</a>, I noted that the new imaging engine combined with the camera sensors gave the phone a distinct advantage over its predecessors, and this was immediately noticeable when using the phone as my go-to camera in a visit to Mexico earlier this month.</p><p>OPPO invited me to attend Día de Muertos, an annual Mexican celebration where communities come together to honor the dead. The two-day celebration included parades and face painting, and was the backdrop to test the cameras of the Find X9 Pro — so let's get started.</p><h2 id="the-main-camera-is-fantastic-2">The main camera is fantastic</h2><p>The Find X9 Pro gets a new 50MP Sony LYT-828 imaging module as the main camera, and it is fabulous. It does a great job in daylight as well as challenging situations, delivering photos with good color vibrancy, dynamic range, and details.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

job tweaking the overall balance of the photos, and this is a definite plus point over the Find X8 Pro. This is evident in low-light shots, where the Find X9 Pro is able to deliver better colors than previous years.</p><h2 id="the-3x-zoom-lens-is-one-of-the-best-around-2">The 3x zoom lens is one of the best around</h2><p>The phone has a 2200MP Samsung HP5 3x module with OIS, and although there isn't a dedicated 6x lens, it wasn't an issue. The 3x lens takes detailed shots up to 10x, and I even got usable shots at 30x — albeit anything over 10x gets a sprinkling of AI.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div

By participating and climbing the league leaderboard, gamers will earn Google Play Points. From there, those points can be exchanged for Google Play Credit, or to unlock special items in apps and games.

Users can expect this patch to arrive on their streaming devices "over the next few weeks." At the core of this update, Google says users can expect Gemini to completely replace its old Assistant (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-assistant/google-assistant-becomes-gemini">bye-bye, Assistant</a>). This is a part of Google's focus to introduce a more natural and conversational voice-powered AI experience, even for its TVs.</p><p>Through Gemini for TV, Google says users can help their kids with school-related topics and homework. If they're learning about natural phenomena, they can ask Gemini about "why volcanoes erupt." Moreover, users can even learn DIY projects with Gemini, as it leverages YouTube videos right on your TV.</p><p>Regarding entertainment, Gemini for TV is smarter than the Assistant, giving users the option of finding shows or movies that fit two different interests. Per Google's example, if you like dramas, but the person you're hanging out with likes comedies, you can tell Gemini about those tastes and see what it produces. Gemini's intelligence can also summarize what happened in the previous season of a show to get you up to speed for Season 2.</p><p>Google highlights its TV Streamer's remote microphone button as your premier gateway to Gemini on TV. As previously stated, this update is rolling out, but it will take a few weeks before all <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/google-tv-streamer-vs-chromecast-with-google-tv-4k">TV Streamers</a> see it.</p><h2 id="gemini-is-here-for-all-you-binge-watchers-2">Gemini is here for all you binge-watchers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7" name="google-tv-streamer-apps-page.jpg" alt="Google TV Streamer Apps page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vpbZNuAkjazePb5HNowsb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been waiting for this update for a little over a month, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/streaming-tv/gemini-for-google-tv-launches-only-a-few-enjoy-smarter-entertainment">Google's original Gemini for TV announcement</a> left quite a few of us out.</p><p>After being teased during CES 2025, consumers knew to expect a major Gemini-focused TV update from Google. When it was finally announced late in September, we saw everything it had to offer. Not only were natural conversations possible with Gemini, but it can also summarize previous show seasons, merge entertainment interests, and help children learn new topics.</p><p>These same capabilities were announced for the Google TV Streamer; however, that original announcement only concerned TCL QM9K series devices in September.</p><p>All we were given was a "later this year" date for more devices, like the Google TV Streamer. It seems the time has finally arrived for the TV Streamer, but we're still waiting on a few more. Google states its Gemini for TV update is headed for Walmart Onn. 4K Pro, 2025 Hisense U7, U8, and more.</p> ]]></dc:content>

In unusual fashion, Samsung is opening up sales for certified refurbished versions of Galaxy S25 models while they are still current. The company's "Certified Re-Newed" program now includes the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25">Galaxy S25, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25 Ultra</a>. If you're looking for a foldable, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-6-review">Galaxy Z Fold 6</a> is now part of the program, too.</p><p>As spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/11/10/samsung-launches-re-newed-galaxy-s25-z-fold-6/" target="_blank">9to5Google</a>, listings for these models are now available on <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s931uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung's Certified Re-Newed online storefront</a>. Buyers can grab certified refurbished versions of the phones at a slight discount. The Galaxy S25 series phones are discounted by between $150 and $260, depending on the model and storage configuration. The cheapest option is the 256-gigabyte variant of the base Galaxy S25, which costs $709.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is priced at just $1,429, and that's $370 lower than MSRP. Here's the full list of available Certified Re-Newed models:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s931uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 (256GB) - $709</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-plus-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5s936uzkexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus (512GB) - $899</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5s938uakaxaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) - $1,109</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-s-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-s25-ultra-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5s938uakexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (512GB) - $1,159</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-certified-re-newed-256gb-sku-sm5f956uakaxaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 (256GB) - $1,429</a></li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-series/certified-re-newed-store/buy/galaxy-z-fold6-certified-re-newed-512gb-sku-sm5f956uzsexaa/" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 - (512GB) - $1,479</a></li></ul><p>If the models above still look expensive despite the certified refurbished discount, that's because both the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus are only available in their higher storage tier. Additionally, the 1TB variant of the Galaxy S25 Ultra isn't available through the Certified Re-Newed program at the moment. Notably, there's only a $50 difference between the 256GB and 512GB variants of the refurbished Galaxy Z Fold 6.</p><p>The availability of certified refurbished Galaxy S25 units comes ahead of schedule. We're used to seeing the Certified Re-Newed models drop after they're replaced by the next generation of flagship.

Samsung has officially opened its One UI 8 Watch beta program based on Wear OS 6 to the Galaxy Watch 5 and Watch 5 Pro.</p><p>The rollout began in South Korea, as per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://r1.community.samsung.com/t5/%EC%9B%A8%EC%96%B4%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%94-%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%98-%EB%B2%84%EC%A6%88-%EA%B8%B0%ED%83%80/%EC%9B%8C%EC%B9%985-%EC%93%B0%EC%8B%9C%EB%8A%94%EB%B6%84%EB%93%A4-%EB%B2%A0%ED%83%80%EA%B0%80-%EC%98%A4%ED%94%88%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EB%84%A4%EC%9A%94/td-p/35750693" target="_blank">post</a> on Samsung Korea's community forum, while other markets, such as the U.S., are expected to follow in the near future (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-watch-5-pro-one-ui-8-watch-beta-program/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>).

There’s also a new Now Bar, a persistent display element that provides real-time updates for ongoing activities right on the watch face.</p><p>You can also combine two tiles into one, so it’s now easier to check information at a glance.

Meanwhile, users of older models like the Watch 5 and Watch 6 are still in beta territory for now.</p><p>Samsung said it would bring the stable update to older devices by the end of the year, but things have moved slowly. Still, expanding the beta program is a good sign that the final release is on the way.</p><p>For now, the beta is only available in South Korea, but U.S. users will probably get access soon. If you have a Galaxy Watch 5 and want to try it, you can sign up through the Samsung Members app by tapping the One UI 8 Watch beta banner, as long as you meet the region and device requirements.</p><p>As is always the case, beta software can have bugs, so it’s best for those who don’t mind a few issues in exchange for early access to new features.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Creative is now aiming to reboot the Sound Blaster series in a big way: meet the Sound Blaster Re:Imagine, a module sound card designed for the modern age.</p><p>To start with, this is much more than a regular sound card; Creative dubs it an audio hub to connect all your devices. If anything, the design and modularity looks like something made by teenage engineering, and I'm immediately interested in the product.</p><p>Creative sold over 400 million units of Sound Blaster cards over the decades, but for this product, it is taking the crowdfunding route. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/soundblaster/sound-blaster-re-imagine-modular-audio-hub-with-ai">Re:Imagine is now listed on Kickstarter</a>, and Creative says it is doing so to engage with its userbase to understand what they need out of a sound card. You'll need to shell out $349 to get your hands on the sound card, and as of writing, the project has $202,000 worth of pledges.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="2HyRDfYvRPneGDadiRvsTf" name="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" alt="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/2HyRDfYvRPneGDadiRvsTf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creative)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Re:Imagine hub has an integrated 32-bit/384kHz DAC, and the amp drives headsets with 32Ω to 300Ω without any issues. It works with Windows, macOS, Linux, PS5, Switch, and all Android phones, and interestingly, you can run it in a standalone mode — it's powered by Linux, and comes with 8GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage and an SD card slot.</p><p>The key allure (for me at least) is the modularity, with the Re:Imagine featuring distinct modules: there's a rotary knob, mixer-style slider, buttons, and a 3-inch panel. The Horizon Cluster unit that Creative is selling includes a base unit alongside one of each module, with the modules attaching magnetically to the base unit. On that note, the base unit contains all the connectors, including 3.5mm out, line in/out, optical, USB-C audio in, and connecting to USB-C hosts.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1024px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="NtaQXQsHGq5fAZmJYdn4Tf" name="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" alt="Creative Sound Blaster Re:Imagine" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/NtaQXQsHGq5fAZmJYdn4Tf.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1024" height="576" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Creative)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The buttons are programmable, so you can customize actions or assign macros when connected to Windows. Creative is bundling a suite of fun utilities that can be accessed via the 3-inch panel, including an AI-based music generator (obviously), music visualizers to truly make things nostalgic, and even a DOS emulator.</p><p>It all looks pretty great, and I can't wait to get my hands on the Sound Blaster Re:Imagine to see how it holds up in real-world use. Creative says it will start deliveries by mid-2026, and with retail prices set to be $500, you'll want to get in on the action if you like the look of the modular sound card.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Glasses like the RayNeo Air 3s make it easy to take a massive screen anywhere, and the use of Micro-OLED tech means you get great visuals on the go. I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rayneo-air-3s-review">tested the Air 3s</a> when they debuted earlier this year, and having used all previous RayNeo models, I found the Air 3s to be more comfortable, and delivering better image quality.</p><p>With the Air 3s Pro, RayNeo isn't really making many changes — which is a good thing. The glasses have the same design and build quality, so they're just as comfortable to wear, and have the same range of adjustability. At 76g, they're not heavy at all, and you don't notice any issues even after using the glasses for a few hours. The Air 3s Pro are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/RayNeo-Air-Pro-Glasses-SteamDeck/dp/B0FJRXSNWK">now available for $299 on Amazon</a>, which is just $30 more than the regular model.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="UWcSiaQqSUpdx3rPVrvXeE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UWcSiaQqSUpdx3rPVrvXeE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If you're interested in XR glasses and want to see how they hold up, I highly recommend getting the Air 3s Pro over the standard model. There's a good reason for this: brightness. The standard Air 3s is decent at 650 nits, and while RayNeo is using a similar image engine on the Air 3s Pro, it somehow boosted the brightness up to 1200 nits, and it makes a huge difference.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MbKqcCcTJP6qa9SKdKtKaE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MbKqcCcTJP6qa9SKdKtKaE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, the Air 3s Pro are the brightest XR glasses available today, and there's a tangible difference over other brands, including devices like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/rokid-max-2-review">Rokid Max 2</a>.

Standard refresh is 60Hz, but you can switch over to 120Hz, and there are six different color modes available, giving you decent customizability when it comes to tweaking the color balance to your tastes.</p><p>To test the difference against the Air 3s, I used the Steam Deck with the glasses for an hour, and then switched over to the Air 3s Pro. There's an immediate difference when using the Air 3s Pro, and it's evident that these glasses get much brighter. While I tend to crank up the brightness to 80% while using the Air 3s, I found it adequate to leave it at 50% with the Air 3s Pro.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="ui5cyy9zuLiqvp9wAj27cE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ui5cyy9zuLiqvp9wAj27cE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="CxHsSfBpEuuzZbWzTwjEZE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CxHsSfBpEuuzZbWzTwjEZE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4726px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="xki7YfanZ8gyN592hLbwZE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xki7YfanZ8gyN592hLbwZE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4726" height="2662" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4732px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="KXGCNHCpEmyab4iRDPuGVE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KXGCNHCpEmyab4iRDPuGVE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="4732" height="2665" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5025px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="CNfwHp8jvoQZk9KG8VbMYE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CNfwHp8jvoQZk9KG8VbMYE.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5025" height="2830" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What makes a bigger difference is that the increased brightness doesn't allow much light bleed, making the Air 3s Pro a much better choice when using outdoors. You still don't get a photochromatic outer lens, so there's inevitably some light bleed if you use the glasses in an environment with plenty of ambient light, but it isn't anywhere as big an issue as with the Air 3s or earlier models.</p><p>That in itself is a big enough change that I now just use the Air 3s Pro over any other glasses while gaming. On that note, connecting to devices is just as effortless via USB-C, and I didn't see any issues pairing the XR glasses to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17 Pro</a>. Because of the weight distribution, there really isn't any strain while wearing these glasses, and the 76g weight is distributed evenly.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="jNqb8ShY28zxADf6EYhDmE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jNqb8ShY28zxADf6EYhDmE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other features are identical to the regular model; you get detailed onboard sound thanks to the dedicated quartet of audio drivers. There's even virtualized spatial audio this time around, giving you a better sense of dimensionality. The glasses project a 201-inch image at a distance of six meters, and you get excellent contrast levels in addition to great color vibrancy.</p><p>RayNeo changed the packaging, and instead of the usual hard shell case, you get a fabric one instead. While it still does a decent job protecting the XR glasses, I would have liked a hard shell case, as the one that came with the Air 3s has better durability — particularly if you're throwing these glasses in a bag. Other than the case, you get a USB-C angled cable, and this is what I used to connect the glasses to various phones and handheld consoles.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="QRaVnGQhKpBVWYv3GtQBeE" name="RayNeo Air 3s Pro" alt="RayNeo Air 3s Pro review on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QRaVnGQhKpBVWYv3GtQBeE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like previous iterations, the glasses are made out of plastic, and there are absolutely no issues with build quality.

The glasses are comfortable to wear, have great color vibrancy and unmatched brightness levels, good onboard sound, and hassle-free connectivity.

It features the largest screen of this group with its 16-inch display, making it great for working with side-by-side app windows, or for sitting back and enjoying a movie.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/acer-chromebook-plus-516-laptop-with-google-ai-16-wuxga-display-intel-i3-1315u-8gb-lpddr5-128gb-ufs-wi-fi-6e-steel-gray/JJ8V8H3CK9" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5208c21e-cd56-4c33-befd-071b19ddc66d" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$479" data-dimension48="$479" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="cd8a6dc0-0f2c-48be-8ad7-b4c13f2c3585" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$429" data-dimension48="$429" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-cx14-14-fhd-chromebook-plus-laptop-with-google-ai-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-misty-grey/JJGGLQVR89" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:800px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="ntANCHPdJJyjtFUwUENx4o" name="asus-cx14-chromebook-plus" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ntANCHPdJJyjtFUwUENx4o.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="800" height="800" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>ASUS CX14 Chromebook Plus (8GB/128GB)</strong>: <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-cx14-14-fhd-chromebook-plus-laptop-with-google-ai-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-misty-grey/JJGGLQVR89" target="_blank" data-dimension112="cd8a6dc0-0f2c-48be-8ad7-b4c13f2c3585" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$429" data-dimension48="$429" data-dimension25=""><del>$429</del> <strong>$249 at Best Buy</strong></a></p><p>Rounding out the pack is another "under-the-radar" option as the ASUS CX14 Chromebook Plus is $180 off, bringing the price down to just $249. This is likely going to fly off the shelves at this price, as you're getting a performant Chromebook that just gets the job done, and is still lightweight and compact. And frankly, I might just grab one of these as an early Christmas present because who knows if it'll be this cheap come Black Friday or Cyber Monday.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/asus-cx14-14-fhd-chromebook-plus-laptop-with-google-ai-intel-core-3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-misty-grey/JJGGLQVR89" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="cd8a6dc0-0f2c-48be-8ad7-b4c13f2c3585" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$429" data-dimension48="$429" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>It's no secret that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are some of the best times of the year to pick up new tech, and this is usually the time we see Chromebooks drop to their lowest prices. That said, if you happen to miss out on these deals, don't fret. I suspect Best Buy and other retailers will be hosting a bunch of deals throughout the entire month and into December.</p><p>That's another one of the nice things about all of these retailers vying for our holiday dollars; if a sale on something specific ends at one place, you'll likely find it somewhere else. Of course, that's not always the case, but it's just something to keep in mind as your start checking things off of your gift shopping list.</p><h2 id="black-friday-2025-quick-links-7">Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy:</strong> <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/1943169/614286/10014?subId1=ac-us-2676731374759437001&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Ftop-deals" target="_blank"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon:</strong> <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=169923&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdeals%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dac-us-8785782665887560546-20" target="_blank"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart:</strong> <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/1943169/568844/9383?subId1=ac-us-5901054168654527553&sharedId=ac-us&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwalmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals" target="_blank"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung:</strong> <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=kXQk6%2AivFEQ&mid=47773&u1=ac-us-1575542962956592600&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2F" target="_blank"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon:</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15733793?sid=ac-us-2167301731429622348&url=https://www.verizon.com/deals/" target="_blank"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile:</strong> <a href="https://www.prf.hn/click/camref:1101l3ZJWb/pubref:ac-us-5030088410141356111/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-phone-deals" target="_blank"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile:</strong> <a href="https://mint-mobile.pxf.io/c/221109/444520/7915?subId1=ac-us-8210971468896635490&sharedId=ac-us&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mintmobile.com%2Fdeals%2F" target="_blank"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T:</strong> <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-100048248-15735111?sid=ac-us-4040834266094535273&url=https://www.att.com/deals/" target="_blank"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Many VPN providers will charge up to $100 for just a year of service, but this Black Friday deal will cover you and your family <em>for life</em> for just 30 bucks, all in. You'll even get two free years of the brand's own password management program. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://fastestvpn.com/vpn-deals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="5a346fb3-d6ad-4318-962b-ab6027572509" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="FastestVPN Lifetime Access: $90" data-dimension48="FastestVPN Lifetime Access: $90" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div><p>FastestVPN may not be as popular as providers like NordVPN or ExpressVPN, but its status as an underdog means that you can get excellent security for much less than the competition. FastestVPN clearly has something to prove by running budget-friendly deals like this, but that doesn't mean that it's cutting corners. </p><p>For just 30 bucks, you'll get up to 15 device logins with access to over 100 destinations worldwide, plus malware protection, server speeds of up to 10 Gbps, ad-blocking, and AES-256 encryption for maximum security. Our sister site Tom's Guide <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/fastestvpn-review">also reviewed FastestVPN</a> and found that live chat agents were available and quick to assist as needed. There's even a fully audited no-logs policy, so you can rest easy knowing that the provider will never store your data.</p><p>Of course, all of this doesn't necessarily mean that FastestVPN is the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-vpn">best VPN</a> ever created for Android users. With just over 800 servers, FastestVPN has a relatively smaller network than some providers, and while responsive, we found that the support team didn't offer particularly detailed assistance compared to some brands. </p><p>But again, this Black Friday VPN deal offers <em>a lifetime </em>of service for your family, and it'll cost you less than a tank of gas. Pair that with two years of password management and a 31-day money-back guarantee, and you'll agree that this is an early holiday gift that keeps on giving.  </p><h2 id="more-black-friday-2025-quick-links-12">More Black Friday 2025 - quick links</h2><ul><li><strong>Best Buy: </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/top-deals"><strong>up to 60% off Chromebooks, Android phones, and more</strong></a></li><li><strong>Amazon: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/deals"><strong>early discounts on headphones, smart home tech</strong></a></li><li><strong>Walmart: </strong><a href="http://walmart.com/shop/deals"><strong>early price drops on ASUS laptops, locked phones</strong></a></li><li><strong>Samsung: </strong><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/"><strong>new Galaxy XR headset, trade-in opportunities</strong></a></li><li><strong>Verizon: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><strong>free phones with new line, trade-in</strong></a></li><li><strong>T-Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/samsung-phone-deals"><strong>free Galaxy phones, $300 back w/ 5G Home Internet</strong></a></li><li><strong>Mint Mobile: </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><strong>50% off Pixel 10, BOGO Unlimited plans</strong></a></li><li><strong>AT&T: </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><strong>get a free Z Flip 7 with trade-in, new line</strong><br></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/black-friday-samsung-galaxy-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Samsung Galaxy deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-google-pixel-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Google Pixel deals</strong></em></a></li><li><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/motorola/black-friday-motorola-deals-2025"><em><strong>Black Friday Motorola deals</strong></em></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>

Per the publication, Samsung has approached the U.K.-based bank, Barclays, which also has a presence in the U.S., to create this credit card.</p><p>So far, it appears that the two companies have gone quite deep in their talks and negotiations to get the ball rolling; however, nothing's been set in stone just yet. The Wall Street Journal reports that the two companies are in "advanced" talks to empower this card with Visa, but an official stamp on things isn't there yet.</p><p>As a part of this potential joint movement, the report states that Samsung would seek to offer a "cashback" rewards program, which consumers can use on its devices. We can think about its smartphones, watches, foldables, tablets, and the like with that. It also seems that Samsung is thinking of letting users leverage that cashback for its appliances, too. Additionally, this rumored "Samsung Card" could even bring "digital pre-paid accounts," alongside "high-yield savings accounts."</p><p>Regarding when we <em>could </em>see an announcement, rumors claim it could happen toward the end of 2025.</p><h2 id="samsung-digs-deep-with-digital-payments-2">Samsung digs deep with digital payments</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:8256px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-titaniumsilverblue-s25plus-navy-s25-icyblue" alt="The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, Galaxy S25 Plus, and Galaxy S25, next to each other." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vfdeGuDnjLPcDdkqgma7YK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="8256" height="4644" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Right now, as far as digital payments go, U.S. consumers have Samsung Wallet. While it's nothing like the South Korean company's (rumored) credit card, it's still got its name out there for payments, as well as offering some cash back for shopping at stores, and features with SoFi. One of Samsung Wallet's newest features is "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL), which first <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-buy-now-pay-later-early-access-trial-spotted">started in early access</a> before <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsung-wallet-now-lets-you-split-in-store-payments-into-installments">officially arriving in July</a>.</p><p>U.S. users can now split their in-store payments when paying with Samsung Wallet at checkout. Samsung brought in support for Visa and Mastercard for this new feature. The app forgoes any credit checks and new financing for users interested in using BNPL.</p><p>Most recently, Samsung Wallet has stepped into the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-wallet-seeks-premium-crypto-with-coinbase-one-access-on-galaxy">cryptocurrency world with Coinbase One</a>.

Through this integration, Coinbase said users can unlock "a smoother path to crypto for millions of mobile users across North America."</p> ]]></dc:content>

Yes, you heard that right, the Plus variant seems to be back in the books, considering Samsung might not be bringing the S26 Edge to the table next time around.</p><p>Earlier today, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/samsung-galaxy-s26-plus">Android Headlines</a> posted images of the alleged Galaxy S26 Plus, showing it off from all angles. The device looks a lot like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s25-plus-one-week-later">Galaxy S25 Plus,</a> with no noticeable design changes.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1420px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE" name="Galaxy-S26-Plus-CAD-renders" alt="CAD renders of the Samsung Galaxy S26 leak online" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dibuzRJrTDf5UjGxjeG2NE.webp" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1420" height="799" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>According to these CAD renders, the Galaxy S26 Plus could feature a 6.7-inch AMOLED 2X flat display with thin, uniform bezels and a centered camera hole. However, as seen in previous leaks, Samsung could be making the phones more ergonomic, meaning the device may have more rounded corners when compared to the Galaxy S25 Plus. All buttons, including the power/lock and volume keys, seem to be located on the right side.</p><p>The website notes that the dimensions of the phone may vary a bit, measuring about 158.4 x 75.7 x 7.35mm. The renders also show the device's rear panel, which houses three camera lenses, with the flash off to the side.</p><p>Rumors suggest the Galaxy S26 Plus could feature a 50MP main, 12MP ultrawide, and 12MP telephoto camera. However, avid tipster IceUniverse took to X to say that the telephoto camera could be much smaller this time, and the main camera will remain unchanged, with the ultrawide camera being similar or the same.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I can say with certainty that the Samsung Galaxy S26, S26+, and S26 Ultra all use the same 3x camera specification, which is as follows:3x camera : 10MP , ISOCELL , 1/3.94" , 1.0μm , F2.4，36°Its effective pixel count is 10MP, not 12MP.Please take a screenshot and save it for… pic.twitter.com/PJoJOLLrQY<a href="https://twitter.com/cantworkitout/status/1987815920988049525">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote><div class="see-more__filter"></div></div><p>It is important to note that the phone's depicted colors are for display purposes only, and there is no confirmation of the actual colors in which the Galaxy S26 may be released. But rumors were suggesting Samsung could borrow the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/galaxy-s26-ultra-may-feature-apples-bold-cosmic-orange-leaks-reveal">bright orange colorway</a> from the iPhone 17 lineup.</p><p>Other rumored specifications of the device are a near-5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging support. Under the hood, the Galaxy S26 is said to get either an Exynos 2600 or a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset, based on the region the device is bought in, paired with 12GB of RAM.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Since Cyber Monday falls just a few days later, on December 1st, you can expect many of the best deals to run through the weekend.</p><h2 id="where-will-i-find-the-best-deals-of-black-friday-2">Where will I find the best deals of Black Friday?</h2><p>When shopping for new tech during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, start by checking the big box retailers, such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. Once you know what you're looking for, don't let retailers pressure you into making a purchase that you're not 100% confident in. Shop around to compare prices, read <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/reviews">reviews</a>, and don't forget to check with your wireless carrier to see what kind of deals they're offering. Websites like <strong>Camelcamelcamel.com</strong> also provide price history on Amazon products so you can confirm that a deal is <em>truly </em>special<em> </em>and not just a common occurrence.</p><h2 id="should-i-buy-a-new-phone-now-or-wait-until-black-friday-2">Should I buy a new phone now or wait until Black Friday?</h2><p>Although there are some exceptional offers worth checking out today, you're probably safe to wait a few more weeks if you're not feeling 100% sure about a deal. Most of the best deals will hang around until December 1st, at least. That said, these offers are unlikely to get <em>much better</em> than they are today, so if you need a new phone now, don't stress the FOMO: if I'm recommending it, you know it's a worthwhile deal (Black Friday or not).</p> ]]></dc:content>

If you need more storage or you don't want lockscreen ads, you can pay more to upgrade, though it's also worth noting that it comes with a microSD port for expandable storage of up to 1TB.</p><ul><li><strong>These are our </strong><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/black-friday-amazon-deals-2025" target="_blank"><strong>top 10 early 2025 Black Friday deals at Amazon</strong></a><strong></strong></li></ul><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:456px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.22%;"><img id="khQzuhm82nC6DmLz7uXc8V" name="amazon-fire-hd-8-twilight-blue-2020.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/khQzuhm82nC6DmLz7uXc8V.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="456" height="457" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Amazon Fire HD 8:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Tablet-Black-32GB/dp/B0CVDN4QS6" target="_blank" data-dimension112="6a292fd9-9e6c-4843-9f58-1388a9de3fd6" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="$99.99" data-dimension48="$99.99" data-dimension25=""><del>$99.99</del> <strong>$54.99 for Amazon's early Black Friday sale</strong></a></p><p>Amazon has cut the price of the Fire HD 8, our favorite Fire tablet, to just $55, even though there are still a few weeks to go before <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> and Cyber Monday.

Spotify Wrapped, a year-in-review feature perfect for social media sharing, is the perfect example of that — and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify/spotifys-listening-stats-round-up-your-latest-musical-addictions-weekly">Spotify just made a similar version of it</a> available year-round. Now, Spotify is teaming up with WhatsApp to bring music and media sharing to WhatsApp Status.</p><p>WhatsApp Status is a temporary way to share what you're loving with your friends and family, and it previously included support for photos, videos, voice notes, and text. Spotify content is now coming into the mix, as you'll be able to share songs, albums, podcasts, and more on your WhatsApp Status — and they'll last for 24 hours. Spotify's new sharing features on WhatsApp work similarly to existing integration with other Meta apps Instagram and Facebook.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/spotify">Spotify</a> explains that users can now share songs, albums, playlists, podcasts, artist clips, and audiobooks to their WhatsApp Status. After sharing, a visual card for the Spotify content will appear with its title and cover art. The visual card includes short audio preview that'll play when your friends and family open your WhatsApp Status. Plus, they'll see an <strong>Open in Spotify</strong> link that opens the shared content in the Spotify app or web client.</p><h2 id="when-can-you-start-sharing-spotify-media-on-whatsapp-status-2">When can you start sharing Spotify media on WhatsApp Status?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vYVTpab9J7ZTcdu4Cy9yXi" name="Whatsapp-status.jpg" alt="Whatsapp status update" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vYVTpab9J7ZTcdu4Cy9yXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="675" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/meta/whatsapp-status-to-gain-collage-photo-sharing-feature">WhatsApp Status</a> integration for Spotify is rolling out now for all users globally. It's a gradual rollout, so it may take some time for every Spotify user to gain access to the feature. Spotify says all Free and Premium accounts will start seeing WhatsApp Status integration "in the coming weeks." When available, you can find it in the <strong>Share </strong>menu in the Spotify app.</p><p>Spotify songs, playlists, and podcasts can also be sent within individual WhatsApp chats. That functionality is still around, but the WhatsApp Status connection is for when you want to share your audio vibe with a bunch of people at once. Aside from WhatsApp, there are seven more ways to share Spotify content with others, as the brand shared in a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2025-11-07/share-spotify-music-whatsapp-instagram-tiktok/" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Although it’s not live yet, this seems like a practical upgrade to the way users make use of reviews. Rather than sorting through random feedback, you could narrow down on what's important, like performance on your phone or offline features.</p><p>Currently, the Play Store only lets you sort reviews by star ratings or a few general categories. This setup often leads to long hours of scrolling through many unrelated posts.</p><h2 id="it-s-a-game-changer-for-decision-making-2">It's a game-changer for decision making</h2><p>The search feature could save users a lot of time and frustration. For example, if you're looking for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-photography-apps-android">best photo editing apps</a> on the Play Store but couldn't decide which one to download, you could type certain topics like “offline” in the search field to see if others confirm it works without internet.</p><p>That said, it remains unclear when or if this capability becomes public. It’s possible this feature could show up first for select users or regions as part of a staged release, which is standard for Play Store updates.</p><p>It’s also not clear how advanced the search will be. We don’t know if it will scan reviews in different languages or offer advanced filters. As noted by Android Authority, the interface hasn’t shown up yet, so it’s currently unknown where we'll potentially see the search bar.</p><p>While the Play Store’s review system is a great source of actual feedback, some users may find it hard to use in its present state.

The Chinese accessory manufacturer has rolled out dozens of exciting products over the course of 2025, and while notable standouts include the usual chargers and power banks, I'm been impressed by its audio gear. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/ditch-your-sony-this-bose-powered-headset-is-better">Inspire XH1</a> headset showed that the manufacturer can deliver sound quality equivalent to Sony and Bose — which isn't astonishing as it is tuned by Bose — and now the XP1 earbuds do the same.</p><p>The Inspire XP1 debuted at $129, and they're <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Baseus-Inspire-XP1-Cancelling-Real-Time/dp/B0FP29H5VL">available for $109 on Amazon</a>. While that is costlier than Baseus' other audio products, it's an unmatched value when you consider the sheer number of features available. The XP1 are also tuned by Bose, and they sound similar to Bose's own <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/i-used-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-gen-2-for-a-month">QuietComfort Ultra Gen 2 earbuds</a>, which are now my favorite earbuds for their sound quality.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4866px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="b9DWZLTjzpqURFiLYR4Y9A" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/b9DWZLTjzpqURFiLYR4Y9A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4866" height="2741" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let's start with the design; the Inspire XP1 have a contoured fit that provides a comfortable fit, and it makes using the earbuds that much easier over the course of a day. If anything, the fit is nearly identical to Bose's QC Ultra Gen 2, and it's clear that the collaboration between Baseus and Bose extended to more than just the sound tuning — similar to what we saw on the XH1 headset. The earbuds are available in two colors, and the white model looks quite distinctive.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LyBsLKGMEZELQS46ATfdHA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LyBsLKGMEZELQS46ATfdHA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only difference with the XP1 is that the earbuds don't get the fin-style design, but this isn't a bad thing. The shell itself is smaller than what you get on the Bose, and I found the buds to be highly comfortable. They're a little lighter as well, and I had no problems in regular use. The sound nozzle doesn't extend that much into the inner ear as well, and the bundled tips provide good noise isolation.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="xxuCKuMaqMU6BbPbDbRREA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xxuCKuMaqMU6BbPbDbRREA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5080" height="2861" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I like the rounded case as well; it isn't bulky in the least, and the design is easily pocketable. It doesn't have Qi charging, but it was easy enough to charge the case itself over USB-C, and the built-in 600mAh battery is good for charging the buds at least thrice over.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5005px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7zQgGJXBtZx88B6ssX9oEA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7zQgGJXBtZx88B6ssX9oEA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5005" height="2819" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5065px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Hp8vHmLtxiZQjkUZmLuaGA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Hp8vHmLtxiZQjkUZmLuaGA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5065" height="2853" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="LvaKhrhsq7itbEbfoUVhKA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LvaKhrhsq7itbEbfoUVhKA.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The XP1 connect over the latest Bluetooth 6.1 standard, and connectivity has been rock-solid — I had zero issues in this regard. The earbuds even get multi-device connectivity, so I was able to pair two devices and switch between the two with relative ease. I used the buds with my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tablets/apple-ipad-pro-m4-13-inch-long-term-review">iPad Pro M4</a> most of the time.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4985px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="MPCyUmVfiuezUgE3jygX7A" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MPCyUmVfiuezUgE3jygX7A.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4985" height="2808" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There's a low-latency mode that's decent when it comes to gaming, and you get a transparency mode. Where the buds truly shine is with noise isolation; the powerful ANC tunes out ambient noise to a good extent. Baseus claims it is effective up to 50dB, and in my testing, I found the buds to completely block out sounds of my (admittedly quiet) keyboard and the hum of the air con. It does a great job with noise in the immediate vicinity as well, and it is a definite improvement over what you usually get in this category.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5020px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="hrh6i3Npos3ES3qwDKGWAA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hrh6i3Npos3ES3qwDKGWAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5020" height="2828" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I also tested the buds on a short flight, and they did an outstanding job, cutting out the whine of the jet engines. They did so well that I'm considering using these earbuds instead of taking a headset on shorter domestic flights. You can adjust the intensity of the noise isolation, and the Baseus app has a good selection of options in this area.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="Go8g6HNgGgrkWy2tbL4nJA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Go8g6HNgGgrkWy2tbL4nJA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Coming to call quality, the XP1 are much better than I thought; the six built-in mics do a good job picking up audio and insulating wind noise while outdoors. Like all other earbuds, the XP1 have controls on the stalk, and they're okay; I had issues triggering actions at times, but this is often the case with most earbuds, so not something that is an issue as such. You can play or pause music and pick up calls using the controls.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="P9SQEtKJyb3qNLrVrH59MA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/P9SQEtKJyb3qNLrVrH59MA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The sound quality is phenomenal. The buds have a 10mm driver, and the overall tuning lends itself well to diverse genres. You get a balanced sound with exaggerated bass, and you get the ability to tweak the sound profile. While there's no shortage of earbuds with great sound, I think the XP1 may have the best overall sound in this category.</p><p>There's a bass boost mode if you need even more rumble in the low-end, and the buds have spatial audio, doing a good job creating a virtualized effect that projects 360-degree sound when you're moving about. The only issue I can think of is that they don't get AptX audio, so if you're using Apple Music or Spotify Lossless, you can't take advantage of the higher fidelity. Other than that, the IPX4 sweat resistance means they're okay during workouts, but aren't suited to be used outdoors when it's raining, which is the case with most buds.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4792px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="AShGgmTG63kRnqoP6THUMA" name="Baseus Inspire XP1" alt="Baseus Inspire XP1 testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AShGgmTG63kRnqoP6THUMA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4792" height="2699" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the battery life is pretty great.

And despite this switch, the PACE 4 is rated to last four days longer for normal use and 16 hours longer with dual-frequency GPS tracking active — undercutting one of the main arguments for using MIP.</p><div ><table><caption>COROS PACE 4 specs</caption><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>PACE 4 specs</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>43.4 x 43.4 x 13.6mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>32g (nylon) or 40g (silicone)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Band</p></td><td  ><p>22mm Quick Release</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Buttons</p></td><td  ><p>3 (Dial, back, action)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>1.2-inch (390 x 390) AMOLED touch</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Protection</p></td><td  ><p>5 ATM, mineral glass</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery (Smartwatch)</p></td><td  ><p>19 days, 6 w/ AOD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery (GPS)</p></td><td  ><p>41 hours (All Systems); 31 hours (Dual-frequency GPS)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Sensors</p></td><td  ><p>PPG, altimeter, accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, SpO2, ECG, dual mic, water depth</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>Bluetooth, Wi-Fi</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Fitness</p></td><td  ><p>EvoLab, Running Fitness/ FTP tests, Training Load, TL recs, recovery timer, effort pace, workouts, personalized training plans</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Navigation</p></td><td  ><p>Breadcrumb, back-to-start, waypoints, turn-by-turn, pins</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The COROS PACE 4 ends up as a kind of PACE Pro Lite, with comparable battery life and the same fitness tools in a smaller, lighter frame — though without offline maps, the one main downgrade.</p><p>At $249, the COROS PACE 4 could make would-be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/garmin-forerunner-165-review">Garmin Forerunner 165</a> buyers think twice.

Plus, the price has only inflated by $50 across three generations and four years, and COROS's dependable post-launch support means the PACE 4 should receive feature updates for years.</p><p>For now, the PACE 4 is launching with some long-awaited tools: a display flashlight mode, menstrual cycle tracking, and music playback controls for your phone. The latter is a basic necessity for some runners that COROS has lacked for years, but it promises the feature will be ready either at launch or shortly after.</p><p>COROS also gave the PACE 4 the same dual-mic and Action button setup introduced by the NOMAD. Essentially, you'll be able to drop GPS-synced Voice Pins during an activity that describes what you're seeing, then see those pins and recordings in your post-workout summary; you'll also be prompted after you finish an activity to summarize your workout feelings to remember later.</p><p>I still need more time to put the PACE 4 through its paces, but I've worn it enough during my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/the-garmin-tech-i-used-and-ignored-to-train-for-garmin-tucson-marathon">marathon training</a> to feel confident recommending it to serious, frugal runners.

two off of my real path, either into the street or on the opposite side of the path. These tend to balance out on a normal winding path, however, and the PACE 4's dual-frequency pinpointing means it isn't badly affected by foliage.</p><p>In fact, COROS and Garmin measured their mile markers in near-unison for the first nine miles. The discrepancy came from Garmin's signal freaking out while I ran through an underpass tunnel, sending me flying in various directions. The PACE 4 gave me a signal-reacquired notification when I exited the tunnel and (correctly) estimated that I'd run in a straight line.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3dhyneXHK8twsm2w9972ZC" name="COROS-PACE-4-GPS-test-6" alt="A Google Maps satellite image showing how the COROS PACE 4 (blue line) compares to the Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange line) for dual-frequency GPS accuracy for a suburban route." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3dhyneXHK8twsm2w9972ZC.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PC73qdBzpoNQWcdWaH3WfB" name="COROS-PACE-4-GPS-test-7" alt="A Google Maps satellite image showing how the COROS PACE 4 (blue line) compares to the Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange line) for dual-frequency GPS accuracy for a suburban route." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PC73qdBzpoNQWcdWaH3WfB.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 3</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="A4pfbVywSJbDkiMTtaUBUB" name="COROS-PACE-4-GPS-test-8" alt="A Google Maps satellite image showing how the COROS PACE 4 (blue line) compares to the Garmin Forerunner 970 (orange line) for dual-frequency GPS accuracy for a suburban route." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/A4pfbVywSJbDkiMTtaUBUB.png" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The second run — another relatively easy suburban route — was more of the same, with the PACE 4 (<em>blue line this time</em>) always measuring me in the ballpark of where it should. It had a little more trouble with underpasses on this run but kept the signal reflection to a minimum, and it did better than Garmin at tracking my path on a narrow bridge.</p><p>I'll put the PACE 4 through stricter conditions when I have time, but COROS gave it the same quality of GPS tracking as the pricier NOMAD and APEX 4, and both of those watches did well in tougher conditions.</p><p>I also need more time to judge how well the PACE 4 battery life lives up to COROS's promises. COROS's estimate suggests it should only use about 3.3% battery per hour of dual-frequency tracking, but it's been closer to 5% so far in my experience; that may change outside of the preview software.</p><p>Ultimately, though, the hardware quality is darn impressive for a $250 watch, and better than what the PACE 3 offered two years ago.

The platform is used for video calls, virtual meetings, and video conferencing, but offers far more ways to communicate than just video and audio streams. There's also a chat function for when users don't want to unmute, and emoji reactions that give the speaker quick acknowledgement without interruption.</p><p>Previously, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-meet-fresh-ui-makeover-update">Google Meet</a> only offered limited support for emoji reactions — providing just nine in all that could be used for in-call reactions. They covered the basics, like thumbs up or down, but Google Meet is now adding support for the full emoji library. It'll allow Google Meet participants to spice up their calls with more variety for emoji reactions. For context, here are the original nine:</p><ul><li>Confetti 🎉</li><li>Clap 👏</li><li>Crying 😢</li><li>Face with open mouth 😮</li><li>Heart with sparkles 💖</li><li>Laughing 😂</li><li>Thumbs down 👎🏻</li><li>Thumbs up 👍</li><li>Thinking face 🤔</li></ul><p>Google says Meet users can now utilize the "full emoji library" for reactions. That opens up user options significantly, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html" target="_blank">Uncode Consortium's official Full Emoji List v17</a> includes nearly 4,000 individual emojis. All of these can now become reactions in Google Meet, as long as you're on Android or the web. Google Meet users on iOS will get the expanded set of reaction emojis "at a later point in time," per the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2025/11/more-emoji-reactions-google-meet.html" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><h2 id="who-can-use-expanded-emojis-in-google-meet-2">Who can use expanded emojis in Google Meet?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="m9QXb2msRvwobrjVmahtPD" name="Google-Meet-on-Android-TV.jpg" alt="Google Meet homepage on Android TV" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m9QXb2msRvwobrjVmahtPD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Jay Bonggolto / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Meet users on iOS aren't the only ones to miss out on the larger set of emoji reactions. Livestream viewers on Google Meet won't be able to access the expanded emoji set, but can view and display them when they appear as reactions.</p><p>The expanded set of emojis is available by default, although they can be limited by Google Workspace administrators and the meeting host. Additionally, people using Meet Rooms hardware won't be able to send emojis from the expanded set. Both users of Meet Rooms and the iOS app will be able to see the wider field of emojis sent by others, but won't be able to send them.</p><p>Google is slowly rolling out expanded Meet emojis to Workspace customers. The administrator controls for this feature is appearing now, as of Nov. 6. However, the emoji reaction options won't appear for end users until Nov. 19th for those on rapid release domains or Dec. 9 for those on scheduled release domains.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's called the File Search Tool, and the company describes it as a "simple, integrated and scalable way to ground <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> with your data." It results in outputs from the Gemini API that are "more accurate, relevant and verifiable," per the announcement <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/technology/developers/file-search-gemini-api/">blog post</a>.</p><p>The File Search Tool makes use of the Gemini Embedding model, but takes the heavy lifting required to develop a custom RAG system off the user. Instead, the tool handles file storage, chunking, embeddings, and dynamic context injection automatically. From there, the File Search Tool uses vector search to understand a given prompt and identify related information and data from provided documents.</p><p>Google says the File Search Tool can uncover relevant information from supplied documents even if the exact words or phrases aren't used. Additionally, the model's responses are easy to verify, as citations show exactly where the File Search Tool and Gemini API pulled an answer from. Users can then double check the model's work to ensure accuracy.</p><p>The File Search Tool supports a wide variety of application and text-based file formats, listed <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/file-search" target="_blank">here</a>. It includes most major file formats and programming types, like PDF, DOCX, TXT, and JSON. This makes it easy to take your existing database and hand it to the Gemini API via the File Search Tool.</p><h2 id="what-you-need-to-try-the-file-search-tool-2">What you need to try the File Search Tool</h2><p>There's a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://aistudio.google.com/apps/bundled/ask_the_manual" target="_blank">demo app</a> in the Google AI Studio that gives developers an idea of how the File Search Tool can be used in their business applications. The tool is paid, but developers only need to pay a fixed rate of $0.15 per 1 million tokens when initially embedding and indexing their files. After that, storage and embedding generation is free for each individual query.</p><p>Google says this payment model "makes the File Search Tool both significantly easier and very cost-effective to build and scale with." It's available now in the Gemini API for those that want to try it out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mzPSfkHwPK6QVAG9WZXZyi" name="Gemini-API-Structured-Outputs" alt="A graphic for structured outputs in the Gemini API." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mzPSfkHwPK6QVAG9WZXZyi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>This is the second Gemini API announcement of the week, as Google previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-is-making-it-easier-to-use-the-gemini-api-in-multi-agent-workflows">unveiled support for JSON Schema</a>, which makes it easier to use the API in multi-agent workflows.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Moreover, a new leak has revealed that pricing for the Galaxy S26 series might be higher, along with some details about the chipset used in the flagship.</p><p>With the Galaxy S25 series almost a year behind us, leaks about the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-s26">Galaxy S26 lineup</a> are starting to pick up pace. We learned earlier that late in the Galaxy S26 development cycle, Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsungs-galaxy-s26-edge-dead-before-launch">replaced the Galaxy S26 Edge</a> with the Galaxy S26 Plus, leading to rumored delays. However, a new leak now suggests the Galaxy S26 series might not be as delayed as expected.</p><p>Korean outlet <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://biz.chosun.com/it-science/ict/2025/11/10/SUYKC7CPC5DT5GHQT2PFJQPAB4/?utm_source=naver&utm_medium=original&utm_campaign=biz">ChosunBiz</a> (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/Jukanlosreve/status/1987743446967456148">@Jukanlosreve on X</a>) reports that Samsung is targeting a late January launch for the Galaxy S26 series, with market availability by mid-February. According to the report, Samsung has resolved the delay caused by the lineup reorganization and is once again planning a launch in the first month of 2026.</p><p>A source close to the publication revealed that as the "hardware verification period lengthened" due to the Edge-to-Plus replacement, "the launch was almost delayed, but this issue has been resolved, making a February launch possible."</p><h2 id="exynos-and-snapdragon-mix-likely-returning-for-s26-series-2">Exynos and Snapdragon mix likely returning for S26 series</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.29%;"><img id="gnWb9hsmnaCzmSiJ3Do66d" name="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5" alt="Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gnWb9hsmnaCzmSiJ3Do66d.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4080" height="3072" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The report also notes that Samsung might again use a mix of Exynos and Qualcomm chipsets for the Galaxy S26 series. The Galaxy S26 Ultra will reportedly use the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-confirms-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chipset</a> worldwide, while the Galaxy S26 and S26 Plus will feature the Exynos 2600 in most regions.</p><p>This, however, might mean that the Galaxy S26 Ultra will cost slightly more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra. A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-increase-price-galaxy-s26-series">recent report</a> indicated that pricing for the Galaxy S26 lineup could rise due to higher costs of internal components like SoC and RAM chips. Today's leak adds further weight to the claim, adding that if the S26 Ultra exclusively uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 worldwide, a "price increase will be inevitable."</p><p>Another noteworthy detail about the Galaxy S26 Ultra (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/UniverseIce/status/1987834471488323932">@UniverseIce on X</a>) is that its front-facing camera might increase in size. The leaker says this will be the "biggest hole ever used on any Ultra model" to date, though the reason isn't yet known. It's unclear if this is due to a larger sensor, but it appears the selfie camera will be slightly bigger than usual on the Galaxy S26 Ultra.</p><p>That said, not all is set in stone yet, as the Galaxy S26 series is still a few months away. A lot could change before its launch next year, though we're finally starting to see how the lineup might take shape.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The front and back glass no longer have any curve at all, which should make it easy to find a good tempered glass OnePlus 15 screen protector.</p><p>The shiny metal sides of the OnePlus 13 have been completely flattened and transformed, making it look and feel an awful lot like an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/apple-iphone/apple-iphone-17-pro-review">iPhone 17</a>. OnePlus rounds off the top and bottom edges more than Samsung, thankfully, but a phone with sides this flat is going to cause some division among owners.</p><p>Thankfully, the surface features a unique ceramic-like feel that's created by "immersing the aluminum frame in a special electrolyte solution and applying high voltage." This transforms the normally smooth aluminum into an impressively textured metal that feels almost identical to ceramic, complete with natural fingerprint-resistance.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="tA7ooqvGd2mwsevHpjYFQ5" name="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-alert-slider" alt="Comparing the hardware of the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tA7ooqvGd2mwsevHpjYFQ5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="p6xmuYZEypgdZBBH3ap7S5" name="oneplus-15-vs-oneplus-13-bottom-edges" alt="Comparing the hardware of the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/p6xmuYZEypgdZBBH3ap7S5.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1153" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Km6wAvzUFEyZ3sYSZyjA7" name="oneplus-15-plus-key-01" alt="The new Plus Key on the left side of the OnePlus 15 replaces the Alert Slider from previous models" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Km6wAvzUFEyZ3sYSZyjA7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="i4pTNW8r7VwGTd3erQYB7" name="oneplus-15-camera-island-01" alt="The flat, raised camera island on the back of the OnePlus 15" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/i4pTNW8r7VwGTd3erQYB7.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC" name="oneplus-15-never-settle" alt="OnePlus's Never Settle logo on a OnePlus 15's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AGJeRUweoSxu2rPx4BamC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>The back glass of my Sand Storm model is also nicely frosted and shows no signs of fingerprints even after days of usage.

I switched to the foldable after using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-find-n5-review">Find N5</a>, and while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold wasn't as thin or light, the software was better than just about any other foldable I used.</p><p>But there was a problem — the cameras just weren't good enough. The Pixel 9 Pro Fold lagged behind the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Find N5, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x-fold-5-review">Vivo X Fold 5</a>, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-magic-v5-review">Honor Magic V5</a>, and it wasn't even as good as a regular mid-range phone. So with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, I wanted Google to do one thing: fix the cameras.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro Fold uses similar camera modules as its predecessor, but it takes better photos thanks to the new ISP in the Tensor G5 and a year's worth of camera tuning efforts. It still doesn't measure up to other foldables — or phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x300-pro-review">Vivo X300 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/vivo/vivo-x200-ultra-review">X200 Ultra</a>, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a> — but it no longer feels like a big enough limitation that I need another phone on hand just to take photos.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5060px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7ctSG2tqh3hWMzAVmcHWg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5060" height="2850" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The biggest issue with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is the weight. Coming in at 258g, it is 43g heavier than the Galaxy Z Fold 7. Yes, you get a bigger 5,015mAh battery, but it's still 32g heavier than the Vivo X Fold 5, which has an even bigger 6,000mAh battery and bigger OLED panels on the inside and out.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5139px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="H63LiyPYbT5kBm4rbWDVi" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/H63LiyPYbT5kBm4rbWDVi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5139" height="2895" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After using the X Fold 5 and Galaxy Z Fold 7, using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold feels like going back a year or two in hardware design. Don't get me wrong; the design is pretty good, and the rounded edges make it distinctive in its own right. But the sheer heft of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold means it is nowhere as comfortable to hold and use as its immediate rivals.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5115px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="BCUPn8JdwapQTQxWeEK4b" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BCUPn8JdwapQTQxWeEK4b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5115" height="2881" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>And although the Tensor G5 is better than its predecessor, it's still not anywhere as fast as what Qualcomm and MediaTek have to offer, and I'm not even talking about the latest chipsets — the G5 doesn't even measure up to the Snapdragon 8 Elite and MediaTek Dimensity 9400. The charging situation continues to be annoying as well. While I like that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a bigger 5,015mAh battery, it charges at a middling 30W, and Google really needs to address this shortcoming.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="9cDhjPELv7mxhqpLiwQpm" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9cDhjPELv7mxhqpLiwQpm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But all of that doesn't really matter because of the software. While I used the Vivo X Fold 5 the most out of any foldable this year, I found myself wanting cleaner software with better usability, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold delivers just that. Yes, it doesn't have the best internals or the best cameras, and the battery doesn't last as long as other devices. But when it comes to the software, there really isn't anything better.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="VYr84KwBPU4eCYWg9D2en" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VYr84KwBPU4eCYWg9D2en.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The foldable runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box, and it just feels better to use. I generally prefer Pixel software, and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold retains Google's unique visual flair while offering plenty of custom extras that you don't get anywhere else. Magic Cue is one such feature, and the ability to automatically surface key information is pretty cool. The real utility is when I'm talking to a brand's customer care about a potential return, and Magic Cue pulls up the order information stored in Gmail.</p><p>It's things like this that make using the software that much easier. The interface itself is clean, and I'm a fan of the quirkiness of the Material You design. The foldable gets good multitasking features as well, and the UI as a whole has better fluidity than previous years.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="HWCKW8v6WVUGY3qBTmjVo" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/HWCKW8v6WVUGY3qBTmjVo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To Google's credit, the brand nailed the rest of the fundamentals. The 6.4-inch outer OLED panel is a joy to use, with vibrant colors and high brightness that doesn't have any issues even under harsh sunlight. The inner 8-inch OLED panel is just as good, and it's terrific when it comes to playing videos or just browsing.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5184px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.33%;"><img id="fXPS2K3p9pTVZgL3Qmoow" name="Pixel 10 Pro Fold" alt="Pixel 10 Pro Fold testing on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fXPS2K3p9pTVZgL3Qmoow.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5184" height="2920" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The battery lasts a day with medium use, and I didn't really run into many problems in this area.

On that note, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold has full IP68 dust and water resistance, and that's also great to see — most other foldables are limited to IPX8, so to have protection against dust ingress is a positive move.</p><p>Just like with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, I enjoyed using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold quite a bit, and while the foldable may not have the best cameras or battery life, Google once again proved that it knows how to deliver a phone you'll actually want to use.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="3128ac6d-d83d-46dc-8eb4-ae654eee7c61">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KSarK35Ns6rwdQH8tvacmc.jpg' alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold in Moonstone"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                        <div class='featured__brand'>Google</div>                                        <div class="featured__title">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Google didn't change too much with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, but tweaks to the battery life and cameras make it stand out a little against last year's foldable.

I like that the cable has all the connectors I need, and Rolling Square is now building on this idea with the introduction of the inCharge Life.</p><p>Instead of connectors, the inCharge Life has a unique modular system that lets you transform the cable based on need. Just want a short cable at your desk? It's available in a standard 4ft length. If you need a longer cable, you can use the cable extender and attach an additional 8ft. There are six cables in total, going from 0.5ft to 8ft, covering all use cases — Rolling Square even has a coiled cable that's ideal to use with a keyboard.</p><p>All cables deliver 240W of power, 10Gbps data as standard, and have status LEDs that light up while charging. They're touted to be the most durable USB-C cables around; with a zinc-aluminum alloy housing, silicone sleeve, and braided nylon design, Rolling Square says these cables are designed to last, and it's doubling down on that by offering a lifetime guarantee.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3556px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="Vbshucgb4X3Cn7kAnZQxcd" name="Rolling Square inCharge Life" alt="Rolling Square inCharge Life" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vbshucgb4X3Cn7kAnZQxcd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3556" height="2000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Rolling Square)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Should you notice any issues with the inCharge Life cable, you'll just need to take a short video of yourself cutting the cable, and Rolling Square will just send a new one. This policy is similar to what Peak Design does with its travel products, and it's interesting to see Rolling Square go the same route with cables.</p><p>The inCharge Life comes as a Keyring Cable with 0.5ft length, a 1ft Travel Cable, a 4ft Desk Cable, 5ft Dual Cable that lets you charge two devices simultaneously, 6ft Coiled Cable, and an 8ft XL Long Cable. The brand is rolling out cable extenders and an accessory that lets you hook the cable to a keyring.</p><p>As for the cost, you can build your own kit, with each cable starting at $29. That's considerably costlier than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-usb-c-cables-adapters">best USB-C cables</a>, but you're basically getting a lifetime guarantee.</p><p>You can also get the full set of six cables — which comes with a bundled travel pouch — that costs $127 or choose between a travel or home kit. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rollingsquare/incharge-life-240w-usb-c-modular-cable-kit-lifetime-system">brand is crowdfunding via Kickstarter</a>, and seeing as how it picked up over $500,000 worth of pledges in under a week, there's clearly a decent amount of interest in these cables. There's just under a month to go, so if you like the look of these cables and want something that comes with a lifetime guarantee, you should act now.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The smaller size is the big draw with this power bank, and you also get an LCD panel that shows remaining battery life. I used this power bank to charge my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/with-the-pixel-10-pro-xl-google-finally-made-a-faultless-flagship">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">Find X9 Pro</a>, and a slate of accessories in the last month, and I now use it as my go-to travel choice whenever I don't need a magnetic power bank. The best part is that the P50 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Portable-10000mAh-Essentials-Powerbank/dp/B0DQD35SQ4">now down to just $26 on Amazon</a>, making it an unmissable value.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="40357ce2-116f-4c72-8601-4872f24c15c9" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="The INIU P50 is a no-brainer recommendation if you need a small travel-friendly power bank that you can take anywhere.

The 10,000mAh battery is able to fully charge any phone without a hassle, and with 45W power, you don't need to wait too long to charge your devices.</p><p><strong>❌Skip this deal if: </strong>You need a retractable cable. While I like that there's a bundled cable, a retractable cable would have been better.</p><p>I like that INIU retained the same design as its larger power banks; while other brands switched to a vertical design, I find this design to be easier to use — at least when it comes to travel. The small size and lightweight design means you can take the P50 anywhere, and it has good build quality.</p><p>You don't usually see USB-A ports on power banks this small, so that's a welcome move. In a similar vein, it's good that there are two USB-C ports on the P50. The built-in cable means you don't have to dig around in your bag to find a charging cable, and while it is short, it doesn't limit usability in any way.</p><p>Charging itself is reliable, and there are no issues in this regard. The P50 goes up to 45W via the USB PD standard, making it a great choice to use with Google and Samsung phones. This is a solid choice if you need a new power bank, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/INIU-Portable-10000mAh-Essentials-Powerbank/dp/B0DQD35SQ4">coming in at just $26</a>, it is a pretty good deal.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Both fit in the relatively affordable yet premium category. They're fantastic phones from reputable brands; you can't go wrong with either, given the reputations of their respective previous generation models. So, the question isn't whether you should get one of these devices if you want a phone with a massive screen. Which one should you get?</p><p>We're here to help by comparing them in the most important ways. Please note that the OnePlus 15 is currently only available in China, and we will not have specific details about the North American market version until later this month. With that said, some specifications, such as charging speed, may differ for that device. However, it's likely that the phone should, by and large, boast the same specs for the U.S. and Canada as it has in China.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-on-the-outside-counts-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: On the outside counts</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h" name="oneplus-15-showcase-qualcomm-summit" alt="OnePlus executive holding OnePlus 15 in hand" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vKJ2HLFpiL3eQUWHFPPu5h.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>First, we'll dive into the look, feel, and durability. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-14">OnePlus 15</a>, as noted, is currently only available in China but is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/a-redefining-global-launch-for-the-oneplus-15-lands-in-the-us-in-november" target="_blank">expected to be released soon in North America.</a> It features a 6.78-inch LTPO screen with a 2,772 x 2,772 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate, which can be boosted to 165Hz for gaming experiences like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Clash of Clans</em>. Get up to 1,800 nits brightness.</p><p>With a matte texture and boxy design based on early renders, it also has a distinctive camera island. On the side is the dedicated Plus Mind button for customized actions. It comes with 256GB or 512GB storage, sadly missing a 1TB option.</p><p>Where it really shines, however, is in durability. It's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/is-the-oneplus-15-waterproof">not only water-resistant with the usual IP68 rating</a>. It doesn't even <em>just </em>have an IP68 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/what-is-an-ip69-rating-and-why-should-you-care">IP69</a> rating like the previous-gen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus-13-review">OnePlus 13</a>. It also meets an IP66 rating for resistance to dust and water pressure, as well as an IP69K rating for close-range high temperature and high-pressure water jets. You could literally toss this phone in the top rack of a dishwasher, run a cycle, and it should be fine.</p><p>It also excels in terms of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oneplus/oneplus-15-battery-life">battery life</a>, boasting a massive 7,300 mAh silicon battery that can theoretically last for up to two days before needing to be recharged. Further, it supports ultra-fast charging at 80W or up to 100W (depending on where you live) with the SUPERVOOC charger and up to 50W wireless with the AIRVOOC charger. This is virtually unmatched by any other phone, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL included, and perhaps only the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/oppo-phones/oppo-find-x9-pro-review">OPPO Find X9 Pro</a> is the exception.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:5144px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.32%;"><img id="saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA" name="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL photos on Android Central" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/saUAET58RZ9nafRP93iwDA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="5144" height="2897" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Comparatively, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is made from a mix of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 and aluminum that gives it a premium feel. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-review">Nicholas Sutrich in his review</a>,  it looks identical to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. Admittedly, it's heavier and bulkier than you might like, especially with the added weight required to incorporate Pixelsnap magnets on the back for magnetically attaching <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-magsafe-accessories-for-android-phone-users">MagSafe</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/best-qi2-accessories">Qi2 accessories</a>, such as portable chargers and grips. This decision, however, is a long-overdue and smart one, marking the first Android phone that can work with Qi2 accessories out of the box, without a case.</p><p>It features a large 6.8-inch Super Actua QHD+ OLED display with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate, a 2,992 x 1,344 resolution, and a peak brightness of up to 3,300 nits, which Sutrich says makes it "ridiculously easy to see outside." Get it in 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB capacities. It's durable, too, but it "only" meets an IP68 rating. So, you can dunk it in water, even keep it submerged for a short period of time. But it's nowhere near as durable as the OnePlus 15.</p><p>In terms of battery life, it has a 5,200mAh battery and supports <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-charging-speed">45W wired</a> and 25W wireless Qi2 charging. That sounds incredibly fast, and it is. However, the OnePlus 15 stands out in terms of both battery life and charging speeds. Sutrich says he only noticed meager improvements to battery life with the Pixel 10 Pro XL compared to the previous generation phones.</p><p>One area where Google has a leg up is in terms of support and longevity. You get seven years of software and security updates with the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL, while the OnePlus 15 will presumably only come with four years of major Android OS updates and six years of security patches. That's still pretty good, but it's something worth considering if you want a phone you can hang onto for as long as possible.</p><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</h2><p>Let’s look at the specs of these two phones in a side-by-side comparison of their key specs.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>OnePlus 15</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>OS</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16, (OxygenOS 16)</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Colors</p></td><td  ><p>Infinite Black, Sand Storm, Ultra Violet</p></td><td  ><p>Moonstone, Jade, Porcelain, Obsidian</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Size</p></td><td  ><p>6.78 inches</p></td><td  ><p>6.8 inches</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Resolution</p></td><td  ><p>2,772 x 2,772</p></td><td  ><p>2,992 x 1,344 </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Screen Type</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO</p></td><td  ><p>LTPO OLED</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Refresh Rate</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz (up to 165Hz for gaming)</p></td><td  ><p>120Hz</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>RAM</p></td><td  ><p>12GB, 16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB/512GB (not expandable)</p></td><td  ><p>128GB/256GB/512GB/1TB (not expandable)</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cameras</p></td><td  ><p>50MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 50MP telephoto, 32MP front</p></td><td  ><p>50MP wide, 40MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto, 42MP front</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td><td  ><p>Stereo Speakers</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>7,300mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wired charging</p></td><td  ><p>80W, 100W</p></td><td  ><p>39W</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Wireless Charging</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td><td  ><p>Yes</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Bluetooth</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td><td  ><p>6.0</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Cellular</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td><td  ><p>5G</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Size</p></td><td  ><p>161.42 x 76.67 x 8.2 mm (8mm for Sand Storm)</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>211-215 grams</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h2 id="oneplus-15-vs-google-pixel-10-pro-xl-features-functions-and-performance-2">OnePlus 15 vs. Google Pixel 10 Pro XL: Features, functions, and performance</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb" name="OnePlus-15-First-look" alt="OnePlus 15 first look at Qualcomm summit" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oxkKtYSJBUcYSXvpsSNuPb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Qualcomm)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Running on Oxygen OS 16 and OnePlus AI with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a>, the OnePlus 15 boasts a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-gen-5">Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5</a> processor with a touch response chip and an advanced Wi-Fi chip.

With the OnePlus 15, you're getting an incredibly durable and powerful phone that will keep up with the needs of heavy users. That's especially so thanks to efficient cooling, powerful processing, and extremely long battery life.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is also a powerful phone, but it comes with some concessions in areas such as battery life, durability, and processing power. However, you also get a clean Android experience with fantastic Gemini and overall AI integration across the board, along with an intuitive user experience. You'll also get a few more years of support for software and security updates, and Google does Feature Drops at least twice a year, always bringing fresh and new experiences to the phone.</p><p>The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a great phone for productivity and light entertainment, while the OnePlus 15 is more of a powerhouse phone for activities like gaming and advanced photo capture, though it has intelligence built in, too.</p><p>You can't go wrong with either phone. The Google Pixel 10 Pro XL already makes our list of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">the best Android phones</a>, and it's a certainty that the OnePlus 15 will replace the OnePlus 13 on that list. If you're an ultra-power user who games a lot on your phone and works out in the field, the OnePlus 15 is an enticing option worth considering. If you feel like you don't need all the added processing power and durability and just want a simple and familiar experience, the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL is a good option, too. Both give you a lot of phone for a huge price tag.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="25c9252a-47d4-4487-97c9-4aaf4003c3d2">            <a href="https://www.oneplus.com/us/launch/oneplus-15" data-model-name="OnePlus 15" ><div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KTcf69eMUZC6mgdp6F2uYJ.jpg' alt="OnePlus 15"></p></div></a>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">OnePlus 15</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The best for power users</strong></em></p><p>If you're a heavy power user who multitasks, plays intense mobile games, travels, maybe even works outdoors, the OnePlus 15 is an option you should consider.

Now, the company is pulling the curtain on a budget pair of wireless earbuds called the Moto Buds Bass, per a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/moto-buds-bass/Welcome-to-the-moto-buds-bass-Community/m-p/10010302" target="_blank">Lenovo forums post</a>. They retail for around $65 and pack the same 12.4mm dynamic drivers as the Moto Buds Plus.</p><p>Moto Buds Bass are available now for £49.99 in the U.K. and €59.99 in Europe, and the price point appears to be incredibly attractive considering the earbuds' feature set. There are three microphones onboard for active noise-canceling and CrystalTalk AI for voice calls. Plus, the earbuds offer up to nine hours of battery life that extends to 43 hours with the case.</p><p>Motorola says the Moto Buds Bass have a 12.4mm dynamic driver that is specifically tuned for low-end sounds, hence the earbuds' name. They support Hi-Res Audio certification, too. The company says these budget earbuds can deliver three times more audio data compared to standard 16-bit/96dB CD quality.</p><p>Moto Buds Bass' ship with Dynamic Active Noise Cancellation that is claimed to cancel out up to 50dB of sounds, which is pretty impressive for budget earbuds. There's an Adaptive ANC that adjusts on the fly based on the wearer's environment. Plus, you have a transparency mode that lets sound through the Buds Bass, which is handy while being out and about.</p><p>Like many of Motorola's recent releases, the Moto Buds Bass are offered in three Pantone colorways. You can grab the earbuds in Dark Shadow, Blue Jewel, and Posy Green.</p><h2 id="where-do-the-moto-buds-bass-fall-short-2">Where do the Moto Buds Bass fall short? </h2><p>While the Moto Buds Bass feature impressive specs, there are a few drawbacks to note. The earbuds don't have an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">official IP rating</a>. Motorola says the Buds Bass have a "water-repellent design," but the company also clearly states they are "not waterproof." Without an IP rating, we wouldn't recommend using the Buds Bass anywhere they could face significant amounts of sweat, water, or other liquids.</p><p>The earbuds' battery life estimates are also calculated with ANC switched off. There will be a noticeable dropoff in battery life when ANC is enabled, so keep that in mind. Finally, while Moto Buds Bass is available in the U.K. and Europe now, global availability is still up in the air (via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.techradar.com/audio/speakers/moto-just-revealed-super-cheap-wireless-earbuds-with-surprisingly-beefy-driver-and-hi-res-audio-certification" target="_blank">TechRadar</a>).</p> ]]></dc:content>

The update is rolling out now on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://galaxystore.samsung.com/detail/com.samsung.android.app.galaxyregistry?langCd=en" target="_blank">Samsung Galaxy Store</a> with version 1.0.67, as first spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-updates-good-locks-registar-three-improvements/" target="_blank">SamMobile</a>. It brings a fix for a Gemini app bug on Samsung Galaxy Z Flip phones and two fixes related to Back Tap on all Galaxy phones.</p><p>The first element of the patch addresses a problem related to launching the Gemini app on the cover screen of a Galaxy Z Flip device. With the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7-review">Galaxy Z Flip 7 and One UI 8</a>, Samsung brought full support for the Gemini app on the cover screen of  its clamshell foldables.</p><p>Additionally, the app update's release notes reveal Samsung applied a "Back Tap stability patch" to the RegiStar module. This should improve the success rate of Back Tap, a tool that allows users to open apps and access features by simply tapping the back of their Galaxy S or Galaxy Z device.</p><p>Separately, the RegiStar module update rolls out a fix for a "function error in power saving mode" for Back Tap. While the patch seems to exclusively include bug fixes with no new features, it's worth installing the RegiStar update, especially if you've been dealing with these issues.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-with-good-lock-s-registar-2">What can you do with Good Lock's RegiStar?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mAwXZ3VzpYjbPvkrDZnLce" name="samsung-good-lock-2.jpg" alt="Samsung Good Lock" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mAwXZ3VzpYjbPvkrDZnLce.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Harish Jonnalagadda / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For those unfamiliar, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/samsung-good-lock">Good Lock</a> is the home for custom software features aimed at power users trying to get the most out of their Galaxy phones.

The ongoing issues are seemingly incredibly specific, as users with the Opera GX browser are reporting problems en masse. The OP (original poster) reported that they were listening to music on YouTube in the background, but suddenly, everything stopped working.</p><p>The site went dark, and the thumbnails for the videos vanished.</p><p>While users thought this indicated that YouTube was down, or at least suffering from server problems, more reports claim that ad blockers might be the problem. One <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnl83is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">user states that</a> accessing YouTube through Opera GX suffers the same problem, while others say going in with a different browser doesn't cause an issue. Another <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnl8a7n/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">report says</a>, "Mine was also broken, seems to be Adblock related, as the site loads fine without it, and completely breaks with it. At least on my end."</p><p>Strangely, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/1oqtrnc/comment/nnldy90/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button">one user says</a> they've been unable to access YouTube through Opera GX with ad block enabled; however, going in with Google Chrome (with ad block) is perfectly fine.

If they're persisting for you, and you're using the Opera GX browser, try the solutions some users have suggested on Reddit. Perhaps that'll fix things, but it's not like users with AdBlock on YouTube haven't had their fair share of issues.</p><p>There was a problem earlier this summer with users and ad blockers, where reports claimed YouTube was "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube/youtube-throttling-your-videos-anti-adblock-crusade-continues">slowing down</a>" their videos. The platform called an audible, opting to reportedly throttle or slow down videos for those using ad blockers.</p><p>Reports said the platform would delay videos and also try to send folks to a Google support page, as if it were a different issue. Of course, the support page suggested removing any extensions (like AdBlock).</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-youtube-app.jpg" alt="The YouTube app listing on the Google Play Store, running on a Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Fm9BFBYs92bPuYnziBKnnk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>YouTube's been <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/youtube-global-efforts-clock-ad-blockers">in this war against ad blockers</a> for a few years now, and it's tried all manner of methods.

While the active noise-cancelling (ANC) was excellent, I found the sound quality a bit flat for my taste. Since then, Bose has changed that sound signature, releasing one of my absolute favorite open-ear products, the Bose Open Ultra. I was also highly impressed with the Bose SoundLink Plus and how robust its audio playback is.</p><p>With those recent experiences, I was looking forward to seeing what Bose has done with the latest generation of the QuietComfort Ultra over-ear headphones! I’ll let you know right now, I was <em>definitely not disappointed</em> with the sound quality this time around. There are some things you should know before buying, though, so I’ll get into all of that below.</p><h2 class="article-body__section"

href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones" target="_blank">As full-size headphones go</a>, you get a relatively compact hard case to carry your headphones in. They fold up small to fit in the case, and you’ll find the included USB-C and 2.5mm-to-3.5 mm cables in a small pocket on the case's lid.</p><p>Some cosmetic changes were made this year: the matte finish of the first gen has been replaced with shiny metal earcup yokes. The 2nd generation QC Ultra Headphones are still incredibly comfortable during long periods of wear, due to their weight (~264 grams/9.3oz), a respectable amount of padding on the cans and the headband, and a clamping force that feels almost non-existent- and that’s a feat, considering that I have a huge melon.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FCBUs6Wp4DHpCr3ZnJ9i87" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-metal-yoke-closeup.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) close up of the new polished metal ear cup yokes" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FCBUs6Wp4DHpCr3ZnJ9i87.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Despite having such a light clamping force, the headphones don’t wobble or make noise when walking, jogging, or working out. I was surprised by how well they stay in place when lying down on a weight bench. I'd advise against using them at the gym as they have no water-resistance rating, though.</p><p>Similar to the previous generation, you get a touch-sensitive volume strip, which also allows you to assign one of four shortcuts to trigger when you touch and hold it. USB-C charging is still on board, but this year, you also get USB-C audio support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio" target="_blank">16-bit, 44.1 kHz, or 48kHz audio</a>, <em>and</em> you can charge while listening, in all modes this time around.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="ELxPUWukrBKbdF3BcgEM57" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-lay-flat.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) laid flat on a table" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ELxPUWukrBKbdF3BcgEM57.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Also new is the ability to remove the headphones and lay them flat on a solid surface to disconnect from your source device, which took around four seconds during my testing. Lying flat for 20 minutes, the headphones will enter a deep sleep, power-saving mode. When I picked them up again, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen would wake and reconnect to the previously connected device in under 10 seconds every time.</p><p>Building on that, the headphones' wearing detection functionality has been top-notch. Highly responsive!</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4032px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SrN4TYXhC24AvTEWFaBn4Z" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-wearing-bus" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) being worn by reviewer, testing the ANC on a busy street" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SrN4TYXhC24AvTEWFaBn4Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4032" height="2268" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>New this year, you can completely deactivate <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/tech-talk-what-is-anc-and-how-does-it-work">ANC</a> through the app. The ANC menu features an on/off toggle and a slider that allows you to adjust the noise cancellation level to your preference. Specifically, where the QC Ultra 2nd Gen excels over the competition, such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/bowers-and-wilkins-px7-s3-review">Bowers & Wilkins’ excellent Px7 S3</a>, is its ability to reduce high-frequency noise significantly.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-noise-canceling-headphones-under-100">Many competitors do a good job of hushing the noise of car engines</a> in a metropolitan landscape, but the <em>whoosh!</em> of cars passing by, the squeal of a subway car’s brakes, or airplane cabin noise is often where things fall apart. Not the case with the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen).</p><p>In addition to my testing while out and about on the streets, I used 80dB of airplane cabin sound on YouTube to test high-frequency ANC, and the QC Ultra 2nd Gen continues to shine in this area.</p><p>One aspect of the ANC function that I enjoy is when you transition from the natural-sounding Aware mode to Quiet mode via the multifunction button on the right earcup; it takes a few seconds to fully activate. As the noise cancellation ramps up, ambient sounds gently fade into the background. While some may not like that, it’s a very pleasing auditory experience for me.</p><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="cqFm8J2cLGNP3uXytVNAx6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-noise-control-half-way.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cqFm8J2cLGNP3uXytVNAx6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="dPJyPwXEvNH9dF9qjsQcs6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-home.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dPJyPwXEvNH9dF9qjsQcs6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 3 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Bgs5NnagLAHspV4oPptZx6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-noise-control.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Bgs5NnagLAHspV4oPptZx6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 4 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="7cxCwZ5aQCS4t3q2iQhYr6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-self-voice.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7cxCwZ5aQCS4t3q2iQhYr6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 5 of 5</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="pne3W42yTWXiXsZuA2ePc6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-app-EQ.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pne3W42yTWXiXsZuA2ePc6.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>What about the sound quality, though? Overall, the QC Ultra 2nd Gen’s default sound profile is a V curve with warm lows for modern music listeners, and solid clarity in the upper mid and high frequency ranges. The soundstage is fairly airy, with good stereo imaging, sound separation, and instrumentation. I was pleasantly surprised by the level of detail retrieval from these headphones as well.</p><p>The app includes a basic set of EQ presets and three-band EQ customization to get the sound closer to what works for you if the stock sound doesn’t completely do it. The headphones take well to those three-band adjustments. Just be careful with the bass slider — at higher volumes, you may experience some distortion.</p><p>Listening to Snoop Dogg’s “Tha Shiznit,” you can clearly hear a detail that often gets lost with other headphones: the sleigh bells in the background. In Michael Jackson’s “Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’,” you can hear the backing vocals that play during the intro as well.</p><p>Listening to Michael Abel’s “Violin Duel” from the “Chevalier” OST, the attack and decay of the aggressively bowed violins, where the martelé technique is being liberally applied, are rendered much better than I had anticipated.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="7HLb4ytyqUFqogB29eyqX7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-modes.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) Bose app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7HLb4ytyqUFqogB29eyqX7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Listening to music and movies with the Immersive and Cinema modes was a mixed bag. One of the muddiest Hip Hop tracks known to man, Method Man’s “Biscuits,” sounds better with Immersive mode on, as it makes the vocals pop despite being buried by the bass.</p><p>However, on other tracks with more balanced mastering, I’ve found that while Immersive mode widens the soundstage a bit, it ultimately renders the treble a bit too bright for my liking. Not sibilant, though, so it isn’t all bad.</p><p>I also found myself deactivating both Immersive and Cinema mode when watching action movies like “Thor: Ragnarok” or “Blue Eye Samurai,” as it buries bass response in favor of pushing forward the frequencies that contain dialog. I can see how, with films that mix more chaotic sound design with dialogue, Cinema mode could be pretty helpful, but in movies and content with percussive sounds like Thor’s hammer clobbering minions in Surtur’s den, that thump gets diminished in an unsatisfying way.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="v3b45G5t5xVtG4NvtcGAV7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-plugged-into-DAP.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) connected to a FiiO M21 DAP" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v3b45G5t5xVtG4NvtcGAV7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="FZ9CekMxobY6zWhTNcrmc7" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-sennheiser-dongle.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) connected to the Sennheiser BTD700 dongle" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FZ9CekMxobY6zWhTNcrmc7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Final notes on sound quality:</p><ul><li>As good as the QC Ultra 2nd Gen sounds via AAC, the detail retrieval and overall sound quality reach a new level thanks to a great <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/best-dacs-for-android">DAC chip when plugged in via USB-C</a>. Sound quality is also great via the included analog cable.</li><li>Read my article here about using <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sennheiser-btd-700-and-questyle-qcc-dongle-pro-hands-on">Bluetooth dongles with phones that don’t support aptX Adaptive</a>, like my Google Pixel 9. With Sennheiser’s BTD700 plugged into the phone and connected to the headphones, HiRes Wireless Audio is a delight. The downside is that you lose connection to the Bose app by going this route.</li><li>The headphones have been clutch on Google Meet and other video conference calls, using my <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/laptops/surface-pro-11-review">Microsoft Surface Pro 11</a>, but listening to music is a different experience. Like the Pixel 9, hi-res codecs aren’t supported, so this is yet another use case for the BTD700. Streaming .flac files from my laptop over Bluetooth via the MusicBee Windows app is a much better experience with it.</li></ul><p>Having had the headphones for only a couple of weeks, I’ll need more time to test, but so far the battery life has been very good. The previous-generation <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bose-qc-ultra-headphones-review">QC Ultra headphones</a> were rated for 24 hours or 18 hours with Immersive mode activated, while this second-generation model is rated for 30 hours or 24 hours with Immersive mode activated.</p><p>It’s going to take you three hours to fully charge them when drained, but a 15-minute charge will get you three hours of playback in a pinch. The good news is that with the addition of USB-C music, you can also charge while plugged in, so the number of times the headphones are dead and unusable for at least 15 minutes should be minimal.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-what-could-use-improvement"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen): What could use improvement</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="Faffm3gBuvoDwokmYNh5e6" name="bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2ndGen-microphones.JPG" alt="Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen) closeup of the microphones on the ear cup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Faffm3gBuvoDwokmYNh5e6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6480" height="3648" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: @tshakaarmstrong)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/tech-talk-what-is-lossless-audio"><strong>Lossless audio explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio codecs explained</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-you-need-know-about-bluetooth-le-audio"><strong>Bluetooth LE Audio FAQ</strong></a></p></div></div><p>For the most part, my complaints are very minor. Starting with putting them away, you’ll need to position the cables and any dongles in a corner of the lid pocket for the case to close properly. This means that using the entire pocket is a non-starter.</p><p>The Bose QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) doesn't support passive playback, which is a double-edged sword. On one hand, you get ANC and Aware mode functionality when wired. On the other hand, if the battery is dead, you can’t just plug in the aux cable and go, which feels like a missed opportunity.</p><p>Additionally, the built-in microphones don’t work when wired, so you’ll have to raise your phone to your mouth to chat. That brings me to my final area of improvement.</p><p>The call quality has definitely improved over the previous iteration, but with so many microphones on the QuietComfort Ultra (2nd Gen) and at this price point, I expect it to be even stronger. It isn’t bad at all, but my voice could be clearer and a bit brighter. As it stands, in my testing, the sound quality is a bit bassy.</p><p>The bright spot, though, is the ability to use the app to control how much of your own voice you’ll hear while on a call.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-2nd-gen-competition"><span>Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones (2nd Gen): Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fQWSLU8xV8szXEMeSxnv4j" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-case" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 headphone case with cable" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fQWSLU8xV8szXEMeSxnv4j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At $450, Bose has a lot of competition on sound quality, but the only other headphones that currently reach, and potentially exceed, its level of high-frequency noise cancellation are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm6-review">Sony’s WH-1000XM6</a>.</p><p>In terms of sound, there’s no clear winner between Sony and Bose, as the differences are very subjective.

Launched back in October 2022, the first-gen Pixel Watch was Google’s re-entry into the smartwatch market, built on a Samsung Exynos 9110 chip and running Wear OS 3.5 at launch.</p><h2 id="support-window-closed-2">Support window closed</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc" name="Google-Pixel-Watch-downloading-update-forced.jpg" alt="Downloading an update on the Pixel Watch" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/d48rhpLLvxaAKFhsSooiQc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Over the past three years, it received multiple updates that improved performance and battery management, as well as two major version upgrades — from Wear OS 3.5 to Wear OS 4, and then to 5.1. With this latest patch, Google is effectively closing the book on major system updates for the device.</p><p>That said, Google isn’t abandoning the watch entirely. Users will still receive app and service updates through the Play Store, ensuring that essential functions remain usable for a while longer. But when it comes to full Wear OS upgrades and long-term improvements, this is the finish line.</p><p>If you’re still wearing the first-gen Pixel Watch, it’s recommended to install the October patch once it hits your device. You can check for it manually by heading to Settings → System → System Updates on your watch. It’s a relatively small update, but an important one for maintaining stability and security.</p><p>And while it’s bittersweet to see support end, the Pixel Watch has had a solid run: three years of updates and consistent improvements. From here on out, it’ll continue to work fine, but without the major Wear OS upgrades that the newer Pixel Watch lineup will enjoy.</p><section class="article__schema-question"><h3>Will my apps still get updates?</h3><article class="article__schema-answer"><p>Yes. Essential apps and services will continue to receive updates through the Google Play Store, even if the core operating system is no longer being updated by Google.</p></article></section> ]]></dc:content>
