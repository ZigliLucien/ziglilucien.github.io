Some are great buys offering excellent value, but others aren't. Most fall somewhere in the middle.</p><p>Unless you have the means to buy one of everything, you have to decide if something is the right fit for you. That can be hard; the companies making them will tell you that you need one to make your life complete, people who got a lemon or just didn't like it will say the product is garbage, and reviewers simply can't cover everything.</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title"></div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV" name="lloyd-should-you-buy_720" caption="" alt="Lloyd going shopping!" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nfXzEyMTiEzSXKWQYbwuAV.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Future)</span></figcaption></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">So many tech products!

Phones are one of those things that start to lose value the minute you buy them, but that doesn't mean they don't work as well as a brand-new one will. Everyone likes to save a little money.</p><p>There is one other good reason to look at a certified device - someone who knows how it should work has looked at it in person. We all know sometimes <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-6a-fingerprint-problems-continue">phone launches can be a little problematic</a>, and small bugs end up in users' hands. Those bugs usually get fixed right away if they can be.</p><p>Whether a phone was returned because of those bugs or not, whatever "fix" was done should be applied as part of the renewal. Some things, like small scratches, are acceptable, but when things don't work as they should, the phone won't be resold until they do.</p><p>Finally, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/ask-jerry-where-can-i-recycle-my-phone">saving an electronic device from the landfill</a> and giving it a new life is good for our planet. That's enough reason to search out "used" phones!</p><p>None of this guarantees the value is there, though. And for this deal, it's <em>totally </em>not something you should buy.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-pros"><span>The Pros</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-official-camera-preview.jpg" alt="Official lifestyle images of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XD8Q8qZRWZeUX8keJSEid5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samsung)</span></figcaption></figure><p>As mentioned above, buying a renewed device can be a great idea. Foldables are no different, and there are a few extra reasons why.</p><p><strong>You're probably going to get a new screen protector</strong>. You might think that's not a big deal, but I'm talking about the factory-installed polymer screen protector that should never be removed. Polymer is a fancy word for plastic, and it's soft. It gets microscratches and fingernail dents on it a lot easier than glass would. You can't change it yourself, but Samsung can.</p><p><strong>The display should be inspected and have a full warranty</strong>. Any tiny scratch on a foldable screen <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/how-does-glass-bend">can be a death sentence</a>, and even with that screen protector, it happens.</p><p><strong>The hinge will have been inspected</strong>. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-most-important-feature-of-a-folding-phone-is-durability">hinge is the most important component</a> on a phone that folds, and it has to be perfect; at least be 100% within the design specs. Someone will have looked at this one and made sure.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-the-cons"><span>The cons</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd" name="mrmobile-galaxy-fold-damage-3.jpg" alt="A damaged Galaxy Z Fold screen" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AwiVnmTitENQN9uLSAKGwd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>There are two reasons why I wouldn't recommend this deal to anyone.</p><p><strong>The price is crazy high</strong>. Samsung's asking $1,169 for a used and refreshed phone that's two generations old. Simply put, that's about $400 more than you should <em>ever</em> spend on a Galaxy Z Fold 5 in 2025. If you really want a renewed Fold 5, you can pick up the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" target="_blank">same model at Amazon for $684.</a></p><p>Finally, the Fold 5 is two generations old. That means <strong>the hinge design is older</strong> and not as good as what's offered today. I can't stress how important the hinge on a foldable is. If it's not spot-on, things go bad.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-my-verdict"><span>My verdict</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk" name="Court-gavel-lawsuits.jpg" alt="Court Gavel" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tyizFyyCo9bH2zWLakd4Yk.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nandika Ravi/ Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Don't buy the Fold 5 refurbished from Samsung. In fact, I find it hard to recommend an older foldable to anyone because the tech that makes a phone fold improves a lot every generation.</p><p>I know foldables are pricey, and the temptation to save a bunch of money is strong. If you really want one and have a set budget, grab the Amazon recertified Fold 5 instead.</p><p>Better yet, look at some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-foldable-phone">other foldables out there</a> and see if you can find a great deal!</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="2e7f10f0-a1b4-486e-81c0-f79bb92685a8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:901px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:99.78%;"><img id="JAG3fmugz5eWTaLYGLTk2K" name="samsung-galaxy-z-fold-5-square-render-w-space.jpg" caption="" alt="" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JAG3fmugz5eWTaLYGLTk2K.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="901" height="899" attribution="" endorsement="" credit="" class=""></p></div></div></figure></a><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: </strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" data-dimension112="2e7f10f0-a1b4-486e-81c0-f79bb92685a8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" data-dimension25=""><del>$746</del><strong> $684 at Amazon</strong></a></p><p>Buying an older foldable can be a little risky, but if you really want one, this is a great deal on one of 2023's best phones.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Galaxy-Z-Fold5-256GB-Unlocked/dp/B0CYR8P77J?th=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="2e7f10f0-a1b4-486e-81c0-f79bb92685a8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" data-dimension48="Samsung Galaxy Fold 5: $746" data-dimension25="">View Deal</a></p></div> ]]></dc:content>

There are thousands of people actively working on "Chrome" in some capacity. Those paychecks — as well as research and development costs, testing, and numerous smaller ancillary expenses — all add up to the millions.

Ads, shopping links, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/google-testing-generative-ai-weather-summaries-for-search">AI summaries</a>, and keyword weighting make all the difference and are why the same search on Google and Bing gives different results in a different layout.</p><p>Of course, the search company gets paid for these types of links. A lot. Their customers expect a good return on the investment, so all kinds of analytics are collected and used to make sure you see the right ads and shopping links in the right places at the right time.</p><p>You know what? That's fine. It drives innovation, which means a better experience for everyone, and the company that does it the best deserves its place in the market.</p><p>The world doesn't work that way, though. A company with the means to manipulate 60% of web search traffic is going to leverage that into money. If you control the browser and the search engine, you're ****ing in high cotton. You can point users towards anything you want. You can't make them click, but you can make sure they can if they want to.</p><h2 id="just-leave-it-to-google-2">Just leave it to Google</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1669px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj" name="openai-searchgpt-hero-wide.jpg" alt="OpenAI debuts "SearchGPT" prototype." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TrCsKMSKRKSQRHxfwWkiEj.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1669" height="939" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OpenAI)</span></figcaption></figure><p>No company that has any stake in a search engine has any business controlling Chrome. I've said it out loud. Not because I don't want Google or OpenAI to make money, but because there will be abuse of that market share. It's human nature.</p><p>The same goes for any company with the financial means to make "special" deals with a search engine. When Amazon pays for 100 ads to be shown, it should be treated the same as Bob's Pet Store when it pays for 100 ads. Bob doesn't have the same means as Amazon, so you're probably going to see links to buy your fish food from the retail giant and not Bob.</p><p>Just because the problem is obvious doesn't mean the solution is. Every company has an agenda, and the potential to abuse a product with that much leverage. They can tell you they're the good guys, but they'll still try sneaky ways to make a dollar. It's their duty to do it because shareholders demand it.</p><p>Whoever <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/what-happens-if-google-has-to-sell-chrome">buys Chrome</a> (if Google is even forced to sell it off) won't build some sort of quasi-socialist "for the people" web browser with it. It will be business as usual. I don't have a clue how this should be handled, but I know for certain that most of the company's interested in it have no business with control of Chrome.</p><p>We might as well leave it in Google's hands if we're going to give it to any of the companies that can afford it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It's been a blast being able to use all of these different foldable phones, but I've recently found myself missing the 9 Pro Fold and growing impatient for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.</p><p>There are a lot of factors at play when it comes to picking what phone my SIM card goes into, but towards the tail end of my time with the Fold 7, I started missing the Pixel. Don't get me wrong, the Fold 7 is everything that I was hoping the Fold 6 would have been, besides the S Pen being put to rest.</p><p>The best way I can describe is to say that the Z Fold 7 is the "work" phone, while the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the "home" phone. However, the Fold 7 or Find N5 are the phones that I gravitate towards when it comes to tinkering with Switch emulation or trying to see what <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/color-me-shocked-the-galaxy-z-fold-7-is-an-absolute-beast-for-gaming">Windows games I can get running in Winlator</a>.</p><p>If the leaks and rumors are true, I'm really hoping that will no longer be the case.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-doesn-t-need-a-flashy-design-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold doesn't need a flashy design</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1156px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="MW96tBzamrvYps6QWYpmd6" name="Google-Pixel-Pro-Fold-10-teaser" alt="Screen of a Google foldable phone being unfolded" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MW96tBzamrvYps6QWYpmd6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1156" height="650" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the outside, the leaks point to Google playing it "safe" with the design this year, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/the-pixel-10-pro-fold-doesnt-need-a-galaxy-z-fold-7-moment-and-heres-why">that's probably not a bad move</a>, especially with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>. I'm sure Google will throw some new and flashy colors at us, with the vibrant ones being relegated to the regular Pixel 10 phones and showing signs of running out of ink on the Pro models.</p><p>But that's not where the excitement comes in for me, although I do love it when Google makes a green or orange phone. Instead, my excitement lies with the expected introduction of the Tensor G5 with the Pixel 10 series.</p><h2 id="google-s-taking-the-leap-2">Google's taking the leap</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8" name="google-tensor-g4-pixel-9-pro-xl-1.jpg" alt="Google Tensor G4 on Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eK5yWTTFGhV2NNhMAeyEB8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Until now, Google's Tensor chip has been manufactured by Samsung, and while it's been a good run, it hasn't been great. The problem has been that the Tensor processor lags at least a generation or two behind what Qualcomm and MediaTek release. And for the most part, it's been fine, as the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-tensor-g4">Tensor G4</a> was the best iteration yet, but between the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Gemini</a> improvements and general Android upgrades, Google needs to turn things up a notch.</p><p>Google reportedly did just that for the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">Tensor G5</a> by making the switch from Samsung to TSMC. According to some <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/12793905">leaked benchmarks</a>, the Tensor G5, which appears to be built on a 3nm process (the Tensor G4 was a 4nm chip), could be more than 30% faster than its predecessor. Those are the kinds of improvements we were hoping to see last year, but it just wasn't meant to be.</p><p>Admittedly, this doesn't mean that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be able to go toe-to-toe with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-elite-for-galaxy-vs-regular-snapdragon-8-elite">Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy</a>, or even the regular 8 Elite for that matter. But it doesn't need to, at least not yet, because it's also rumored that the G5 is Google's first "fully in-house made processor."</p><p>That's an important point because it's also what Apple and Samsung do with their respective processors, and it just so happens that Google is now relying on the same company that Apple does to produce its processors.</p><h2 id="what-s-it-all-mean-2">What's it all mean?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ" name="terminal-app-pixel-9-pro-fold-android-16-beta-3-1" alt="Terminal app on Pixel 9 Pro Fold running Android 16 Beta 3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oCEmiq7DminLg3B4MNmXGZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So why does it matter, and what does it mean? Well, nothing really, at least if you're upgrading from the Pixel 9. But as we saw with the addition of the Linux terminal with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixels-march-2025-feature-drop">March 2025 Feature Drop</a>, Google has <em>something</em> planned for the future, and it's probably going to be big. So, having complete control over the design and manufacturing should give Google all of the tools it needs to truly blend the hardware and the software.</p><p>And that's without even talking about what Google might have in store for the future of Gemini. I wouldn't be surprised if we were also introduced to a new Gemini model, with "nano-banana" and references to "GEM_PIX" making the rounds on X (formerly Twitter). So when you consider what Google was able to do with the Tensor G4 for Gemini, having more control from top to bottom, along with better general performance, should mean that the sky is the limit.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nano banana from LM Arena 🍌Feels like an on-device (nano) image generation model to power upcoming Google Pixel 10 devices.

My concern is that even with the aforementioned improvements, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-emulators-android">emulating higher-end systems</a> with the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's massive screen will result in disappointment.</p><p>What I'm hoping for is that even if the Tensor G5 trails behind the Snapdragon 8 Elite on paper, it will close the gap in a massive way. Then Google takes what it's learned from this go 'round, and puts Qualcomm, MediaTek, and Apple on notice with the Tensor G6. But until then, I'll just keep watching the clock tick until next week's announcement.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming Pixel 10 refresh, check out our</em> <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a>.</p><div class="product"><a data-dimension112="8a97b89b-acd2-493d-b028-214542966a15" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold" data-dimension48="Okay, I know what I said about being excited for the Pixel 10 Pro Fold.

According to DCS, Samsung has supposedly "registered" the device well ahead of its expected debut date, which could be in January 2026, if history continues to repeat itself. The rumor claims the S26 Pro could feature a 4,300mAh battery capacity, which is apparently "rated" at 4,175mAh.</p><p>Usually, consumers will see the "typical" rating, which, in this case, is 4,300mAh.</p><p>The leaks add that the Galaxy S26 Pro was listed with a 6.2-inch display. The tipster didn't have much more to add based on this rumored Chinese registration. Still, we're pretty far from any eventual launch of even Samsung's teasers. We can take these early specs with a grain of salt for now.</p><h2 id="new-name-but-familiar-specs-2">New Name... but familiar specs?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Plus-vs-Galaxy-S25-displays-01" alt="Comparing the display size on the Samsung Galaxy S25 with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FpkX9SiA9fV5enS52ZaXu6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of July, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/rumor-galaxy-s26-edge-s26-pro-battery-specifications-alleged-increases">rumors surfaced</a> about the Galaxy S26 Pro and Samsung's next Edge model. Those rumors claimed that the S26 Pro was discovered with a 4,300mAh battery. Why this is so significant is because of a previous rumor that says <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-might-switch-things-up-with-its-galaxy-s26-lineup">Samsung could vastly switch up</a> its S26 series by dropping the S26 and S26 Plus for the S26 Pro and S26 Edge.</p><p>If the S26 Pro is replacing (what would be) the base S26 model, then this rumored battery capacity is slightly higher than the vanilla S25. When it comes to the S26 Edge, those rumors said it could see a 4,200mAh battery. A big jump from its current 3,900mAh. However, this is still under the S25 Plus' 4,900mAh battery.</p><p>Perhaps Samsung could lean on its alleged "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-sus-battery-tech-galaxy-s26-rumors">SUS CAN</a>" battery tech that a report said the OEM was considering back in May. This battery tech would lead to "significantly" bigger batteries in the S26 series, while also boosting charging capabilities. So, while these early rumors might not scream "massive batteries," maybe that'll change in the future.</p> ]]></dc:content>

Again, Google is sticking with its promotional tagline: "Ask more of your phone." The teaser runs through its first feature, which seems to touch on the phone's telephoto lens. Google asks, "What if the camera could get super, super, super close" to your subject, while you're undoubtedly pretty far away.</p><p>The teaser doesn't expand on that, but the clip rolls into quite a familiar feature that we've even seen tested during an I/O keynote.</p><div class="see-more see-more--clipped"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet hawk-ignore" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It’s amazing what you can create when you ask the right questions.

In 2024, after the Made by Google event of that year, the Pixel 9 went live for pre-orders, but not <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-to-use-add-me-google-pixel-9">before we saw Add Me showcased</a> during the keynote. Android Central's Jerry Hildenbrand said it best: Add Me is "AI that people can understand." The Pixel 9 is capable of taking a group photo once, and then allowing the photographer to step in somewhere and snap another.</p><p>It then leverages its AI software to graciously merge those two photos to a point where it looks like <em>someone else </em>took the photo. Like a video game where it's just some camera floating by a string. While this feels like a feature we should've expected on the Pixel 10, it's nice to see Google (sort of) say so.</p><p>Let's also not forget about the foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, which <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/key-specs-of-the-upcoming-pixel-10-pro-fold-unveiled">has had some rumors</a> surface quite recently.

One of its major updates is "Guided Learning" for students, which they can use to ask for step-by-step help with Gemini. Students looking to study with a little more depth (and assistance) can provide Gemini with all the details they can before, and let the AI break it down in a more digestible fashion.</p><p>Google states in today's post that Gemini will also create "images, diagrams, videos, and interactive quizzes" to further enhance a student's learning experience.</p><p>Elsewhere, Google is highlighting its newest Storybook update for Gemini. Parents can now create illustrated and AI-voiced storybooks for their kids using their own photos, their child's drawings, and more. The company states that parents can tell Gemin to create a specific story based on a photo, and tell the AI their child's age and interests to help create a short storybook they might enjoy.</p><p>This storybook feature is available for users globally on computers and mobile devices.</p><h2 id="from-fun-intuitive-to-new-gemini-intelligence-2">From Fun & Intuitive to new Gemini intelligence</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1200px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:52.25%;"><img id="uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX" name="Gemini-2.5-Pro" alt="Gemini 2.5 Pro graphics and benchmark results." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uPsBYvCc8XT9ckpz5YjUmX.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1200" height="627" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is an update that concerns Gemini Ultra subscribers this month, and that's the AI's "Deep Thinking" upgrade. As Google states, Deep Thinking enables the AI to understand and provide better answers for users with complex math and coding problems. The company states Deep Thinking upgrades Gemini's "reasoning," likely making the answers it returns more comprehensive.</p><p>A big Gemini update just started rolling out this week, which Google briefly mentions, and that involves "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-app-personal-context-uses-old-chats-future-personalized-answers-update">personal context</a>." Essentially, the personal context feature enables Gemini to remember and callback to previous chats you've had with it. These older chats will help it remember key details about you automatically without you needing to repeat yourself. If you've previously asked Gemini for a recipe, but said you were allergic to a specific seasoning, the next time you look for inspiration, Gemini will (ideally) keep that allergy in mind.</p><p>Of course, the AI can still mess up, so it's always worth keeping an eye out for that. Additionally, "Temporary Chats" arrive, giving users a little more privacy when asking questions that you don't want Gemini to remember. Temporary Chats were announced on August 13, but Google states this will take some time to reach more users, so it might take a few weeks.</p><p>Google first introduced <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/google-brings-first-of-its-kind-gemini-drops-for-its-ai-updates">Gemini Drops in July</a>, where it creates a complete roundup of the latest updates for the AI.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The publication's snapshots allege that the Pixel 10 Pro XL will be the "giant" in this new series, which sounds pretty much like what we got last year. The leak states the 10 Pro XL is listed with a 5,078mAh battery; however, its supposed "energy efficiency" rating is only a "B." The publication adds that the Pixel 10 Pro XL has been estimated to last roughly 48 hours before needing a charge.</p><p>On the other hand, there's the Pixel 10 Pro, which has supposedly received a 4,707mAh battery, estimated to last 51 hours. The extended life on its battery per charge seems to tie into its "A" rank battery efficiency.</p><p>Curiously, the leak states the base Pixel 10 offers a slightly higher 4,835mAh battery (over the Pro model) with an "A" in efficiency and an estimated 49 hours before needing to charge. The alleged battery for the base model is 135mAh larger than the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Pixel 9</a>.

In that one, the Pixel 10 Pro's 6.3-inch display was alleged, as well as a 4,870mAh battery. This creates quite a strange narrative, considering the latest leaks claim this capacity is slightly lower than originally theorized. If anything, it's dropped the Pixel 10 Pro under the base model, which seems strange when you think about it.</p><p>The rumors from June add that the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL could see 29W and 39W charging capabilities, respectively.</p><p>The 10 Pro Fold <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/key-specs-of-the-upcoming-pixel-10-pro-fold-unveiled">hasn't been left out</a>, as a more recent leak seemingly shone a light on its entire spec sheet. It seems this model could receive an IP68 rating and support for Qi2 wireless charging.

The problem is that most buds are uncomfortable or they won't stay in place, and you'll never find a pair of earbuds that sound as good as my Sony XM5s. That's where the Pixel Buds Pro 2 come in.</p><p>While they still can't quite meet the sound quality offered by headphones, these versatile earbuds are the only pair that I've worn comfortably for hours on end. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 don't fall out of my ears when I go for a run, the ANC (active noise cancellation) works great, and they connect almost instantaneously to my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-review">Google Pixel 9</a>.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL" name="Google-Pixel-Buds-Pro-2-8" alt="The Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 in the Mint colorway." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PH6kd6he4CbSGcuQ9QxMjL.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I can fine-tune the EQ settings using the companion app, and the 11mm dynamic drivers deliver big, well-rounded sound that belies the buds' small frame. The included charging case could also get you up with 48 hours of battery life on a single charge, which is pretty impressive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/earbuds/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-vs-samsung-galaxy-buds-3-pro">compared to something like the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro</a>.</p><p>Of course, they're not for everyone. The Buds Pro 2 lose a lot of their functionality if you aren't using the Pixel ecosystem, and if you can afford them, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/sony-wf-1000xm5-review">Sony WF-1000XM5</a> are arguably better in just about every way.

Other brands that follow annual product cycles might want to consider the same approach.</p><p>I say that because the Sony WH-1000XM6 come with lofty expectations based on the world-class active noise cancelation (ANC) and sound quality the line is known for.

The WH-1000XM6 fold flat <em>and </em>inward to reduce their footprint and make them easier to travel with. The hinge is also more durable this time, and the headband gets a wider profile that helps reduce any feeling of clamping on your head.</p><p>The rest of the design largely follows previous models, including a matte finish and similarly-sized ear cups and replaceable pads with familiar memory foam.</p><p>A brief note about the case. It’s similar to previous ones, except for how the XM6’s fold to lessen the overall footprint. The latch closing them shut feels like an easier method than the all-around zipper, too.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ambient-passthrough" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 from the back" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9PjhDSv3WJNxDwigWCULth.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Internally, Sony jumps from eight microphones in the<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review"> </a><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/headphones/sony-wh-1000xm5-review">WH-1000XM5</a> to 12 mics in the XM6, spreading them out by laying out eight on the outside of the ear cups and four inside the cups to help capture all the ambient noise and reduce it to mere silence. That’s where the new QN3 processor comes in — the noise-canceling brain that does the legwork behind the scenes.</p><p>On a recent flight, I could barely notice the droning sound of the plane’s engine or hear the person sitting next to me. And rather than pause playback or remove the headphones, I would just put my hand over the right cup to automatically lower the volume and briefly disable ANC to hear an announcement or exchange a few words with someone.</p><p>If I choose to take them off, the wear sensors are as good as ever, immediately pausing playback and resuming instantly once back in place.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-ear-cup-fit" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZhTvKJkzCQSFcNDNoyn39j.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The one remaining challenge is high-frequency sounds, like sirens, screaming kids, and screeching train tracks. The XM6s do a great job muffling them down to more insignificant levels, though it also depends on how loud your audio volume is. If those sounds remain continuous or repetitive, you’ll find yourself raising the volume to dampen them further, which could be a problem if you go too loud for longer stretches.</p><p>Sony’s Sound Connect app is rife with a variety of cool settings, though I wish it would clean up the interface to lay it all out in a more constructive way. As is, it feels aged, crowded, and lacking intuition, but you’ll need to navigate through it to find important pieces to utilize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-1" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app equalizer" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/bY34dijAdo2LhnWrQoe5Zi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests. This differs from other brands that use onboard mics to measure the shape of your ears and hearing ability in that it leans more toward a sound signature than personal tuning. I recommend going through this process — or at the very least, tinkering with the EQ to see what suits your own taste for tuning.</p><p>It's not that the XM6 don’t sound good out of the box. It’s just that, like a lot of over-ears these days, the flatter EQ may not fully realize its potential. More dynamic bass, mids, or treble would require you to find that balance on your own. It’s certainly there, given Sony’s excellent foundational tuning, so the odds of you coming away with amazing sound quality are quite high.</p><p>A big reason is that the 30mm drivers are so clean. Sony changed the architecture inside without overtly affecting how the sound travels to your ears, helping retain the clear and resonant quality established throughout the 1000XM line.</p><div><blockquote><p>One of the most influential and subjective features is Find Your Equalizer, which creates a custom EQ setting based on a series of sound preference tests.</p></blockquote></div><p>That also explains why all audio passing through the drivers feels consistent, whether it’s 360 Reality spatial audio or hi-res tracks using the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained">LDAC codec</a>. It’s too bad (though hardly surprising) that there’s no aptX HD support to broaden hi-res options, but since LDAC is a Sony codec, the exclusivity is on brand. This still gives Android users a leg up in<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-to-stream-hi-res-music-from-phone"> hi-res support</a> compared to iOS users, who can’t access the same quality.</p><p>The clarity extends to phone and video calls, which improve in two distinct ways. Extra mics mean you should come in clearer for those on the other end, while better sound makes them feel clearer to you. Sony pulls this off by way of an AI model that identifies voices and separates them from the surrounding ambient noise. It works in the background, proving to be an integral reason why busy streets and even gusty winds won’t succeed in ruining the conversation.</p><p>For anyone on the go or working in an office, it’s the kind of reliability you want when communication is key.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:68.46%;"><img id="5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-screenshots-2" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 app auto-play settings" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/5PVGeMoBYQsnmhDVfsLoUh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1402" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>You can take all that further through the Scenes feature on the app, an expansion of Auto-play as it was previously known. Within it is Adaptive Sound Control to automatically adjust noise cancellation and ambient sound settings based on your location, and whether you’re walking, running, sitting, commuting, or working out.</p><p>The Auto-play portion starts playback from your preferred service (Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube Music, or Endel) once you put the headphones on. Voice Cue reads out incoming notifications, including messages, which is convenient when you don’t want to pull your phone out. This way, you could verbalize a response through <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/how-use-gemini-app-android">Gemini</a> while keeping your hands free. It takes a while to figure out how all these things work, but they are worth trying given their uniqueness.</p><p>The onboard controls are a mix of two physical buttons and touch panels on the right ear cup. Both buttons are distinct to ensure you don’t press the wrong one. Press the ANC button to toggle between it and ambient sound, or hold it down to mute during phone calls. You can also set it so that a double or triple-press launches one of the supported music services. Press the power button once, and you’ll hear battery life levels.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-buttons" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 ear cup buttons" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oPiYiG9QB69DF3MfPTH9ch.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The rest of the touch-enabled controls on the right ear cup let you play/pause with a double-tap on either side. Simply swipe up or down to raise or lower the volume, or forward to skip a track and back to repeat one. You can also swipe forward or back and hold your finger to fast-forward or rewind, or press and hold on the earcup to activate Gemini or whichever voice assistant you use.</p><p>It’s common for touch controls to act finicky, yet these seem almost incapable of doing anything wrong. While you can turn them off entirely, you can’t adjust their sensitivity in case you feel they’re too effective. Nor can you change or reassign them.</p><p>Fortunately, despite all the extras going on here, battery life holds steady, largely managing up to 30 hours with ANC on. You can feel assured they’ll last for a long-haul flight or daily commute, but it’s worth noting that some competitors offer significantly more battery life per charge.</p><p>One thing I do like is that Sony retains the ability to charge and use the headphones at the same time, meaning you could charge them through your laptop while simultaneously listening to music or making a call. In a pinch, Sony claims you can get up to three hours of playback on a quick three-minute charge, which I can confirm is about right.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-sony-wh-1000xm6-what-i-don-t-like"><span>Sony WH-1000XM6: What I don't like</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh" name="Sony-WH-1000XM6-hanging" alt="Sony WH-1000XM6 hanging on a chair" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/twMfGW7QpoDqXoAmkcseoh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ted Kritsonis / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">Editorial</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/headphones/everyone-needs-3-pairs-of-wireless-headphones-here-are-my-picks"><strong>Here's why you should own at least 3 pairs of headphones</strong></a></p><p class="fancy-box__body-text"><strong>- </strong><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/audio/bluetooth-audio-terms-codecs-explained"><strong>Bluetooth audio terms and codecs explained: aptX, LDAC, LC3, and everything else</strong></a></p></div></div><p>Finding fault in these headphones kind of feels like nitpicking, but no product is ever truly perfect, and even the WH-1000XM6 headphones will show a crack or two. I don’t have enough hair on the top of my head for additional padding, so the headband tends to be the one thing I adjust more often because of the thinner foam layer Sony goes with here. Your experience may vary.</p><p>A major disappointment is the lack of USB-C wired playback. I noted earlier that you could charge and listen at the same time, but that doesn’t mean the audio runs through the USB port. You would have to connect via Bluetooth or use the 3.5mm cable instead. That’s a real bummer for anyone wanting to do so on a phone or tablet without a headphone jack, forcing you to use a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter as a workaround.</p><p>If you’re thinking of these as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-wireless-headphones-working-out">workout headphones</a>, keep in mind there is no IP rating for them. How well they can handle sweat is hard to gauge, and without the protection, you’ve got nothing to mitigate damage in the one-year warranty, so a cautious approach is wise to protect your investment.</p><p>Lastly, while I already touched on this, the app needs some sort of streamlined overhaul.

The color of each container has a slightly different background from the main page, making them more prominent.</p><h2 id="google-contacts-just-got-more-brighter-and-expressive-2">Google Contacts just got more brighter and expressive</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:71.95%;"><img id="y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm" name="google-contacts-material-3-expressive" alt="New Material 3 Expressive design in the Google Contacts app" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/y63J4aiioS3fiRauEtaJbm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3280" height="2360" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: 9to5Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There aren't major visual changes in the Highlights and Organize tabs — apart from each section and contact using the same <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive</a> containers — while the "Create contact" page remains untouched. The actual contact info page, however, has some new UI changes.</p><p>The icons for Call, Message, Video, and Email are now larger and pill-shaped, similar to other apps updated with Material 3 Expressive design. The new shape makes them more prominent and easier to tap.</p><p>Other changes include the removal of the "Contact info" label above the phone number, while remaining details on the contact info page are placed in matching containers like the rest of the app.</p><p>If you don't see the new UI yet, it's because it's rolling out with the 4.6.1.x version via the Google Play Store.

Currently, when you get a phone call, you only see a small profile image of the caller in the middle of the screen (if you've added one) and nothing more. By contrast, iPhones show a full-screen contact image, making calls feel more personal.</p><p>Google appears to be adding a similar option on Android. In another report, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2025/08/14/google-phone-calling-card/">9to5Google</a> has detailed that customizable calling cards are rolling out to some Phone beta users.</p><p>Calling cards let users add a full-screen image of the caller. They can also choose from different fonts and colors, making the entire incoming call screen more customizable. Once the update rolls out, the Contacts app will prompt users to create calling cards directly from the contact info page.</p><p>The new calling cards aren't widely available yet, showing up only for some people on the Phone by Google 188 beta app version. There's no official word on when they'll roll out, but with the Pixel 10's release approaching, it could happen sooner rather than later.</p> ]]></dc:content>

This algorithm has reportedly cleared the FDA hurdles for "intervaginal temperature-based ovulation tracking."</p><p>This algorithm will monitor and display changes within a woman's body as time goes on.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/ultrahuman-ring-air-adds-afib-new-app-store-of-powerplugs">Ultrahuman</a> states women should gain a better understanding of their cycles and ovulation periods as their lives continue to evolve. Cycle & Ovulation Pro is said to collect a woman's "physiological patterns and temperature biomarkers" through the Ring Air. This provides tracking on the Ring Air that is estimated to be 90% or higher in accuracy. Additionally, Cycle & Ovulation Pro will offer fertility planning support for women, guiding them through various cycle types for "accurate ovulation confirmations."</p><h2 id="logging-changes-understanding-patterns-2">Logging changes & Understanding Patterns</h2><div class="inlinegallery  carousel-layout"><div class="inlinegallery-wrap" style="display:flex; flex-flow:row nowrap;"><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 1 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-tracking" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug for the Ultrahuman Ring Air lets women understand their cycle via tracking, data, patterns, and more." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hHSgzLy3aVvi9qcUsfKQ8U.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div><div class="inlinegallery-item" style="flex: 0 0 auto;"><span class="slidecount">Image 2 of 2</span><figure class="van-image-figure " data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS" name="ultrahuman-cycle-and-ovulation-pro-confirmation" alt="The Cycle & Ovulation Pro PowerPlug is arriving for the Ring Air, giving women better understanding with ovulation confirmations and trends." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/cgr5u2juthXoGgNPTGipvS.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=""><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Ultrahuman)</span></figcaption></figure></div></div></div><p>Cycle Flags are another aspect of this Pro feature. Ultrahuman says Cycle Flags take into account your temperature data to "suggest hidden patterns" to help you understand cycle variability. Certain trends can include "early or late ovulation, short luteal phase, the absence of ovulation," and more. As previously mentioned, the Cycle & Ovulation Pro feature is designed to help all women, even those outside of the "normal" 28-cycle period.</p><p>Ultrahuman says its feature is designed to help women with PCOS or endometriosis.</p><p>Lastly, Cycle & Ovulation Pro contains a logging feature, letting women note their moods, symptoms, and any changes in behavior. These changes could correlate with "cycle phases," per Ultrahuman, and could help women better identify "long-term" wellness trends.</p><p>Cycle & Ovulation Pro is available for users with the Ultrahuman Ring Air in the U.S., EU, U.K., Canada, and Australia for $3.99 per month or $39 per year. The company teases that other regions are to come. More importantly, those using the regular Cycle & Ovulation PowerPlug can still do so without any disruptions.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The most recent one comes from WinFuture, which seems to have got a hold of the entire spec sheet of Google's upcoming foldable, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10-pro-fold">Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a>.</p><p>The spec sheet posted by the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,152955.html">publication</a> backs all the previous rumors we've heard about the device. To begin with, its display, the foldable is expected to have a larger 6.4-inch external display with a maximum refresh rate of 60 to 100 Hertz and an increased maximum brightness. The resolution of the outer screen is expected to be 2364x1080 pixels, sporting 3000 nits of max brightness.</p><p>As previous leaks have indicated, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is expected to see thinner bezels on the external screen, which gives users a wider screen to play with. This was also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-in-its-first-official-teaser-before-launch">confirmed in Google's teaser</a> that was posted two days ago,  giving viewers a full look at its rear panel and internal display.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb" name="Google-Pixel-10-Pro-Fold" alt="A white product render of the Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold leaked by Android Headlines." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vh9E8eNvK5CNFsGeF5ymUb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="1000" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: OnLeaks / Android Headlines)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The leak also details the device's internal display, which is said to be identical to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, measuring 8 inches diagonally, but could see increased brightness reaching 3000 nits. Under the hood, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will supposedly sport the new G5 Tensor chipset with a Titan M2 chip for security. As seen in Evan Blass' leak last week, this one all but confirms the fact that the device will show up with a 5015 mAh battery that can last for over 24 hours and up to 72 hours with extreme power saving mode."</p><p>Additionally, the website notes that the Fold will reach 50% in 30 minutes with a 30W USB-C PPS charger. Speaking of charging, chatter on the block is that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be the first foldable ever to get Qi2 support, with the rumored "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-to-allegedly-get-qi2-magnetic-pixelsnap-accessories">PixelSnap</a>,"  wireless charging system, which allows charging at 15 W.</p><p>The website states that the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will show up with an IP68 dust and water resistance rating, which would be a game-changer if it were true, considering the device would be the first foldable to ever see such durability. This is backed by its aviation-grade aluminum body, ultra-thin internal glass, as well as foldable glass.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1899px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE" name="google-pixel-10-pro-fold-teaser-hero" alt="An image of the Pixel 10 Pro Fold from Google in its rumored Moonstone color." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7R8KfaApqBTALp86vsyybE.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1899" height="1068" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other known and rumored specs include the device's camera array, which is said to remain the same as its predecessor, with a 48MP main camera, a 10.5MP ultra-wide-angle camera, and a 10.8MP telephoto zoom lens. The website notes a possible change with the maximum optical magnification, which could be up by a factor of 10. This could give us zoomed-in images with better detail.</p><p>The device is expected to come in three storage options (256GB / 512GB / 1TB) and two colorways: Moonstone and Jade. The leak claims that the device will get 7 years of Android updates, as well as security updates and feature drops. Lastly, the device is said to come with Android 16 out of the box and Gemini's latest capabilities. While the device is all set to launch in a week, you might to be able to get your hands on one until <em><strong>October</strong></em>, as the tech giant has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/report-allege-pixel-10-pro-fold-pixel-watch-4-shipping-delays-issues">reportedly run into "supply chain issues."</a></p><p>While this leak seems extremely comprehensive, it's important to note that some features mentioned in leaks don't make it to the device itself.

Launched earlier this morning (Aug 14), HTC highlights the VIVE Eagle as "AI-driven wearable eyewear." Since this is—let's say—an alternate route from HTC's VR headsets, the company's senior vice president, Chris Huang, said, “VIVE Eagle represents HTC’s newest exploration in the realm of intelligent living and personal wearables."</p><p>The VIVE Eagle touts a "premium design" at a lightweight 49 grams. HTC states users can alter its comfort by adjusting its nosepads and contoured temples for a fit that'll last you all day. Additionally, the post highlights the inclusion of ZEISS sun lenses, which provide UV protection "without compromising optical clarity."</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:400px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:150.00%;"><img id="SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3" name="htc-vive-eagle-black-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle smart glasses in a black option." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SBfdrSZmPXNN7nx3hPbEG3.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="400" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Packed into the VIVE Eagle is voice-activated AI with support for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini">Google's Gemini</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/chatgpt-android-app-launch">OpenAI's ChatGPT</a>. HTC states its AI support can help users capture life's moments with a simple phrase: "Hey VIVE, take a photo." The VIVE Eagle will capture your photos using its 12MP ultra-wide camera, thanks to VIVE AI.</p><p>Recording is another capability of the VIVE Eagle. The press release states users can ask their glasses to record a reminder, take notes, and more just by using their voices.</p><h2 id="music-prviacy-2">Music & Prviacy</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7" name="htc-vive-eagle-berry-frames" alt="The HTC VIVE Eagle in its Berry color option on a female model." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TvTivFmGJpUJ8oDgqj6rb7.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Other than capturing memories, HTC states its newest AI glasses can even carry your favorite tracks for you. The post highlights the VIVE Eagle's open-ear design with "large acoustic drivers and virtual bass" for richer audio. The company also states the glasses' audio capabilities help to minimize sound leakage, meaning you (hopefully) won't disturb others around you. While out, the VIVE Eagle's speakers can deliver your music in full volume; however, you should still have the awareness to understand what's happening around you.</p><p>Speaking of staying a little private, the glasses reportedly sport AES-256 encryption to safeguard your data stored locally within the device. More importantly, HTC says the content you capture with the VIVE Eagle is "never uploaded, tracked, or used for AI model training."</p><p>Some smaller AI specifications state the VIVE Eagle supports real-time translation for 13 languages. The content the glasses capture via the cameras is then translated and fed to the user through its speakers. HTC states its support encompasses Arabic, Traditional Chinese, English, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, Thai, Turkish.</p><h2 id="taiwan-pre-orders-2">Taiwan Pre-orders</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="4RiPNd7pRhA9nLqvfSxFd9" name="htc-vive-eagle-two-frames" alt="Two pairs of HTC VIVE Eagle smart glasses against an orange and blue background." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4RiPNd7pRhA9nLqvfSxFd9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="608" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: HTC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>While staying lightweight, the VIVE Eagle contains a 235mAh battery with up to 36 hours of standby time. This battery is also said to last roughly 4.5 hours for continuous music playback purposes. In 10 minutes, the glasses are estimated to reach 50% charge.</p><p>The HTC VIVE Eagle glasses are available today (Aug 14) for consumers in Taiwan for NT$15,600 (~$518). Consumers in the region will find it in Berry, Coffee, Grey, and Black. At the moment, there's no word on whether or not global users will be able to get their hands on the VIVE Eagle.</p> ]]></dc:content>

After <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/perplexity-just-made-a-usd34-5-billion-offer-for-chrome">Perplexity offered Google $34.5 billion</a> to acquire the world's most-used web browser earlier this week, another buyer has now put their name in the hat.</p><p>Search.com, one of the new AI-based search engines gaining attention, has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/14/3133771/0/en/Search-com-Tops-Perplexity-Bid-with-35B-Bid-for-Chrome.html">announced</a> it topped Perplexity's offer with a $35 billion bid for Google Chrome. Unlike Perplexity, which did not disclose its backers — despite being valued at less than half its bid — Search.com confirmed its bid is "backed by JP Morgan."</p><p>Search.com says over 65% of the world's population uses Google Chrome, and embedding AI into the browser must be "equitable" as it could determine how more than 3 billion people access information in the future.</p><p>The company says that if the bid goes through, Search.com - owned Chrome will offer users cash back for using the browser. It also said it would end the "ad-cluttered web experience" and offer publishers revenue sharing, which has been a long-standing issue since the rise of AI tools like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">Perplexity</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/ai-mode-levels-up-with-new-ai-features-stealing-google-searchs-spotlight">AI Mode in Google Search</a>.</p><h2 id="search-com-says-it-ll-offer-perks-for-users-and-publishers-2">Search.com says it'll offer perks for users and publishers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z" name="chrome-app-icon-android" alt="Google Chrome for Android app icon on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KQat5cKuMmdJpcqaeWu75Z.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Sanuj Bhatia / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similar to Perplexity's bid, Google hasn't commented on Search.com's offer yet. The Mountain View giant finds itself in this position as it fights an antitrust legal battle in the U.S. that could force the divestiture of Chrome.</p><p>Last year, the DOJ took significant <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-might-be-forced-to-split-up-chrome-and-android-over-antitrust-concerns">antitrust action against Google</a>, ruling that Chrome illegally monopolized the search market. The DOJ explicitly called for divestiture, though Google appealed. Federal judge Amit Mehta is set to issue a ruling on remedies, though he's unlikely to mandate a forced sale outright.</p><p>Still, with such a large user base and traffic volume, companies are lining up in case the judge rules otherwise.</p><p>This isn't the first time companies have shown interest in buying Chrome. Alongside Perplexity, Yahoo, OpenAI, and equity firm Apollo Global Management have all expressed interest in acquiring it.</p> ]]></dc:content>

According to the post, the FDA's interest stems from the Whoop MG's lack of certification for its blood pressure tracking capabilities. As such, the FDA reportedly told Whoop that it should seek "prompt action" to rectify this issue.</p><p>Bloomberg notes a statement from an FDA spokesperson today (Aug 13), which says the agency "has not authorized BPI for any use, including for the measurement or estimation of a user’s blood pressure."</p><p>On Whoop's side, the company says the FDA has "misinterpreted" its blood pressure estimation tool as a "medical tool." More importantly, Whoop adds that its Blood Pressure Insights feature is labeled as a wellness-focused tool, and that it is not intended to diagnose more severe cardiovascular medical issues. The publication cites a letter written by Whoop to the FDA on August 4, which reads, "We believe it is not within the FDA’s authority to regulate the product. We therefore do not intend to remove the app."</p><p>The post highlights Whoop's intention to meet with the FDA, in hopes of having "a constructive dialogue" with its officials.</p><h2 id="wellness-or-medical-2">Wellness or Medical?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1655px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA" name="whoop-5-0-mg-official-launch-rendering" alt="A rendering of the Whoop 5.0/MG bands from its May launch in black and white color options." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ZAFTQA7WY6FqgkWk998bAA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1655" height="931" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Whoop)</span></figcaption></figure><p>To expand on this, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.whoop.com/eu/en/thelocker/introducing-whoop-5-0-and-whoop-mg/">Whoop 5.0 and Whoop MG</a> launched earlier this year in May. The Whoop MG is the main highlight for this particular topic since it introduced the company's Blood Pressure Insights. Per the company, the BPI feature is designed to provide "daily estimates of systolic and diastolic ranges right from your wrist." Its launch post states these estimations may help users "understand your recovery, sleep, stress, and more."</p><p>While Whoop's fine print states its BPI is "not a medical device," echoing its statement to the FDA, the agency continues to hammer home the fact that the device "does not fall under the general wellness device policy..."</p><p>Bloomberg highlights that the feature is only available for Whoop Life plan members, which costs a whopping $359 per year.</p> ]]></dc:content>

It identifies who you are and stores information about your carrier account.</p><p>Now it's rumored that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-rumor-ditching-physical-sim-for-esim-consumers-beyond-worried">Google will do the same thing</a> with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10</a> series, which means most other phone makers will likely soon follow.</p><p>An easy explanation is that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/difference-between-sim-and-esim-and-what-future-holds">eSIM is a chip inside your phone</a> that replaces the little plastic card you normally get from your carrier and need to put inside your phone. You need it to have normal phone and data service, and without one, you can usually only call the emergency number (911 in the U.S.).</p><p>The old "normal" way used a small memory chip on the card itself and some circuitry inside your phone to read what is written on it. This includes all your account information, your phone identity, and it can often hold other data about contacts or a locking mechanism to make sure nobody can use your cell plan without knowing a code.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:3000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="vuhoB3FaqHRHBCFgLXL7uh" name="iphone-14-pro-max-review-4.jpg" alt="iPhone 14 Pro Max in front of MacBook Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vuhoB3FaqHRHBCFgLXL7uh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="3000" height="1688" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>When using an eSIM, the memory is inside the phone itself, and you don't need a plastic card.

You can automatically switch information or use a better APN (<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-apn-and-how-do-i-change-it" target="_blank">access point name</a>) for the best service.</p><h2 id="is-android-ready-for-esim-2">Is Android ready for eSIM?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4240px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="BGVazsJ3D7HssHQqBv3BBh" name="Android-Bot-MWC-2024" alt="A statue of the Android bot" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BGVazsJ3D7HssHQqBv3BBh.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4240" height="2385" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Derrek Lee / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Yep! <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-14-review">Android 14</a> and up provide everything you'll need to seamlessly use an eSIM. It also makes it easy to set one up and switch to a different carrier if you ever want or need to.</p><p>Companies that make phones like the idea of the eSIM for another reason, too: it offers one less place for liquid to get inside and makes it easier to build a "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-do-waterproof-dustproof-rugged-ip-rating-numbers-mean">waterproof</a>" device. That, and it saves them money; when you build millions of a thing, saving 0.05 cents per unit adds up.</p><p>Phone carriers are another story. In the U.S., the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/iphone-android-esim-transfer">iPhone 14 was an eSIM-only device</a>, and that caused a lot of headaches for a lot of people when it was time to set up their new phone. Things are a lot "better" now, and carriers love the idea of using an eSIM even if they still struggle with the process a little bit.</p><h2 id="why-carriers-love-esim-2">Why carriers love eSIM</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ" name="Verizon-att-t-mobile-bribe.jpg" alt="Illustration of carriers taking money from someone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mdoWdTq5cdpF4iXSF89pmQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In theory, you should be able to do something like scan a QR code, wait five minutes, and use your phone. All the data that needs to be written to the eSIM comes from the carrier, and it can be done wirelessly. I like the way that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-fi">Google Fi </a>does it; the company has your details, and all you need to do is check a box in the app and wait a few minutes.</p><p>That highlights why carriers are behind the idea. They get even more control over your phone.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:900px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.22%;"><img id="587cj4RBkJkGJJcokYbufR" name="sim-card-pile-hero-16x9.jpeg" alt="SIM cards" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/587cj4RBkJkGJJcokYbufR.jpeg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="900" height="506" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div></figure><p>You can install and set up a physical SIM card yourself. A little bit of Googling will tell you what numbers to put in what places in your phone settings, and unless you're trying to use a stolen phone or one blacklisted by a carrier, it will work.</p><p>With an eSIM, you ask the carrier if they will do this for you. Whether you do it by scanning a code, using an app, or visiting a store, you still need to a carrier to do everything. If you enter any numbers yourself, they can be overwritten. And they will be unless they are the numbers the carrier wants you to use.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:6000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="rvE8QS4vPUNK7MkqW4ENEK" name="visible-esim-compatible-android-laptop.jpg" alt="Visible compatibility web page" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/rvE8QS4vPUNK7MkqW4ENEK.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="6000" height="3376" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Your carrier should have no problem doing this. It's how they provide service and collect payment. When you want to switch carriers and stop those payments, things could be different.</p><p>More realistically, they can do things like try to offer you discounts if you sign a new contract or tell you they need you to finish your billing cycle before they can proceed.</p><p>Those kinds of tactics are effective. That's why you see <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-28335713" target="_blank">horror stories</a> about trying to cancel a Comcast or Time Warner subscription.</p><h2 id="is-it-all-bad-2">Is it all bad?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="nqCH7GrbQ4n9dRLYXeWy5e" name="xfinity-mobile-logo-on-phone.jpg" alt="Xfinity Mobile Logo On Phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/nqCH7GrbQ4n9dRLYXeWy5e.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1600" height="900" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Comcast)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For most people, none of this will make any difference. You've picked a carrier because you <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/heres-every-us-city-5g-coverage-right-now">like the level of service</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/these-are-cheapest-data-plans-you-can-buy-us">the price it offers</a>, and you will probably never switch. When you get a new phone, the carrier will quickly do what's needed to get it up and running, and things are the same as they have always been.</p><p>The people who point out how an eSIM gives the phone carriers more control and potential for customer lock-in aren't wrong, though. It's there, and it's a real possibility should a company like Verizon decide to leverage it.</p><p>We don't know for sure that the Pixel 10 or any future phones will be eSIM-only devices, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least. The tech is good and should be used. The rest is not the phone manufacturer's problem.</p><p>Maybe none of this will ever happen, and carriers will soon be able to all set up and use the eSIM seamlessly. But the potential is still there.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For note, the 4 in the IP48 rating means that the device is dust resistant down to 1mm particles, which is good enough for most things, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/8hgg4YEdPak?si=San_k1f23fA-tNww&t=367">JerryRigEverything's video shows</a> (timestamp 6 minutes).</p><p>But I expected the first fully dust-resistant hinge to come from the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/honor-phones/honor-launches-magic-v5-foldable-yoyo-ai-features-launch">Honor Magic V5</a>, or a company like Oppo or Vivo. Definitely <em>not</em> Google, as the company is rarely among the hardware engineering elite. After all, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9">Pixel 9</a> unabashedly looked like an iPhone, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review">Pixel 9 Pro Fold</a> hardly stood out among a crowd of far more unique foldable phones.</p><h2 id="what-s-in-a-foldable-hinge-2">What's in a foldable hinge</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM" name="foldable-phone-hinges-mr-mobile-youtube" alt="A screenshot showing foldable hinges from Mr Mobile's video "Inside A Folding Phone: The Hinge That Helped Oppo 'Delete The Crease'"" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/UTxyE5ZTurVUCQftEZnUJM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mr Mobile / YouTube)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Nearly every foldable phone on the market uses a different kind of hinge. While all early foldables used gears, most recent foldable phones have switched to a gearless system. While gears make it easy to lock the hinge in place, they also provide a point that allows dust to enter or, at the very least, a point of failure if dust were to ever get inside the hinge.</p><p>Since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review">Galaxy Z Fold 4</a>, Samsung has been using gearless hinges. They're interlocking metal parts that slide together and stay open via cleverly designed angles. You can see them in action in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/1C1XpwR55ZY?si=qFQt9_1j7ep9G253&t=538">JerryRigEverything's Z Fold 4 video</a> (timestamp 9 minutes), and Google has been using gearless hinges in its Pixel Fold phones for the last two years, as well.</p><p>But Pixels aren't historically known for their durability or long-term use. From overheating processors to problems with warranty claims and even <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-7-pro-volume-rocker-falling-off">parts falling off</a>, Google doesn't exactly have a great name in this area. Again, as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://youtu.be/NJK_sLBJvsw?si=tLlEzVjF7Jx4NZ3g&t=355">JerryRigEverything's Pixel 9 Pro Fold video</a> (timestamp 6 minutes) shows, Google has work to do on durability when compared to the competition.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.30%;"><img id="KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT" name="Motorola-Razr-Ultra-2025-titanium-hinge" alt="Razr Ultra 2025 titanium hinge" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KcvdL8WdBxXv4PPERmPsXT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1000" height="563" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">The Motorola Razr Ultra 2025 with its titanium hinge and visible gears. </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Motorola)</span></figcaption></figure><p>So, how in the world is it that Google will supposedly be the one with the first <em>dustproof</em> hinge? The "6" in that rumored IP68 rating means the hinge is completely sealed off from dust of any type or size, which means the Pixel 10 Pro Fold's hinge is going to be as airtight as the International Space Station.</p><p>Hyperbole aside, that takes a lot of bespoke engineering hours to accomplish and, again, is something that not even Huawei, Honor, Vivo, Oppo, or Samsung have been able to accomplish with all the money they've dumped into foldable phone R&D over the years. I'm not saying it's out of the realm of possibility at all, but I certainly didn't expect it from Google's Pixel engineering team, which is <em>only</em> on its third generation foldable product.</p><h2 id="the-pixel-10-pro-fold-durability-is-just-part-of-the-picture-2">The Pixel 10 Pro Fold durability is just part of the picture</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4" name="google-pixel-9-pro-fold-review-4.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold on fence railing" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3vdxMY2tqLQZFRre938Rw4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>But let's be fair to Google, it looks like the Pixel 10 is going to bring Google into an entirely new realm of engineering excellence.

Does it know the "future" because it was programmed to, or is it using a complex neural network to determine a possible future based on all the knowledge it has in its seemingly endless database?</p><div  class="fancy-box"><div class="fancy_box-title">AC thVRsday</div><div class="fancy_box_body"><figure class="van-image-figure "  ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' ><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC" name="ac-thvrsday-logo.jpg" caption="" alt="AC thVRsday logo" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LGmZZrc8DWcxmZm6RRUYbC.jpg" mos="" link="" align="" fullscreen="" width="" height="" attribution="" endorsement="" class="pinterest-pin-exclude"></p></div></div></figure><p class="fancy-box__body-text">In his <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/ac-thvrsday">weekly column</a>, Android Central Senior Content Producer Nick Sutrich delves into all things VR, from new hardware to new games, upcoming technologies, and so much more.</p></div></div><p>But then it dawned on me: I was talking to an <em>actual robot</em>. It didn't matter how it thought; it was all about how realistic it felt and how close this was to the sci-fi movies we've all grown up watching. These robots were seemingly pulled straight out of the Star Wars universe and could not only function within their designed parameters, but could also psychologically process and respond to any question I asked them.</p><p>This was more than just a ChatGPT moment for me. It was a surreal representation of a future I didn't genuinely think I'd ever live to see; yet, before me was a collection of robots, each with its own job and seemingly functional brain.</p><p>The only way this could have felt more realistic to me is if these were <strong>physical</strong> robots in front of me in a cafe, but thankfully, their heavy mechanical bodies were still confined to the boundaries of my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/meta-quest-3-review">Meta Quest 3</a> headset. For now, at least. And soon, everyone will be able to check out the full experience in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/stellar-cafe/23951924494476537/">Stellar Cafe</a> when it launches on the Meta Quest platform later this year.</p><h2 id="just-another-day-in-stellar-cafe-2">Just another day in Stellar Cafe</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ti38XOKwXwI" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>My demo opened with me sitting in an elevator. As the doors opened to Stellar Cafe, I could see the friendly bartender wave to me in an attempt to usher me into the room. But, like those strange dreams we all sometimes have, none of my appendages (or virtual inputs) seemed to be working.</p><p>So I asked my handy virtual assistant how to get to the bar and, much to my surprise, my assistant <em>warped me</em> <em>to it</em>. Now I know I can move around just by asking, and the future-forward flavor of this demo has only just begun.</p><p>Immediately, James, the bartender, introduces himself and asks me what I want to drink. Having never visited Stellar Cafe before, I thought my safest bet was to order from the menu, so a Meteor Mocha it was. That is, until I read the ingredients on the side of my cup and realized it had oat milk in it.</p><div><blockquote><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with synthetic milk instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. </p></blockquote></div><p>Upon telling James I was allergic to oats, he profusely apologized and whipped up a new Meteor Mocha with <em>synthetic milk </em>instead. None of this was scripted, and it's not something a developer would likely think of to build into a game in the first place. Heck, I've been to more than a few coffee places that didn't even realize someone could be allergic to oat milk, and you'd think they would be the ones on top of that stuff.</p><p>My conversations with the three other robots in the room were similarly impressive. One robot was sitting next to a scenic view of a few planets, and I wondered if it would know more about them. Turns out it did, and not only that, it wasn't just hallucinating answers the entire time. After describing the planet Golga (I think it said Golga) as "a soulless planet filled with corporate resorts and pristine beaches," I asked it which planet it was referring to.</p><p>To my surprise, it not only told me that the purple planet was Golga, but the green planet next to it was "just some backwater mining colony" that seemed to provide all the resources needed for the corporate overlords running the planet next door.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-05" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of a robot writing a letter quitting its job" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9Sdsta7Ap92jTThCGbqvaS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Similarly, all the robots remembered my name as Devin, a misnomer that occurred when I was interviewing Astrobeam's CEO, Devin Reimer, and the game overheard me asking him about something at the bar. Apparently, James asked me my name, and I didn't have the heart to correct him, although it would have been easy enough to do so.</p><p>But Stellar Cafe isn't just some LLM experiment that you'll want to play for 5 minutes and move on to the next thing. Reimer told me the game always takes place in the cafe (hence, the name), but the robots you'll see are always changing. Like a normal cafe, there might be some regulars, but there are plenty of fresh faces (or face screens, as the robots call them) to meet all the time.</p><p>The demo's main objective was to convince all the robots in the room to RSVP for that evening's party. The demo ends once you complete this task, but the full game will venture on to that party and introduce a whole host of new characters and places. Regardless of your location, your goal is to chat with robots and help solve problems through conversation — a core tenet of being human, I'd say.</p><h2 id="a-uniquely-stellar-game-2">A uniquely stellar game</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-04" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the fortune teller" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fYAoWJu4qR4AF5sB45cQfT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Throughout the entire experience, I couldn't get over how profoundly different it was to navigate with my voice. To date, I haven't seen any other games — VR or otherwise — that used voice quite like this. Oftentimes, when you see voice interaction in games, it's just to complete commands.</p><p>In Espire 2, one of the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-meta-quest-games">Meta Quest games</a>, you sneak around like Solid Snake in Metal Gear Solid, and can tell guards to "put their hands up," or "freeze," to make them surrender. But these are very specific commands, and you can't just ask your in-game robot companion to go do something for you.</p><p>In Stellar Cafe, that's the whole premise behind the concept, something Reimer says the studio has been working on for the past two years. LLMs like ChatGPT are based on natural language input, and Reimer says the team has constructed a bespoke model that runs efficiently enough to make this a one-time purchase title. Not only that, but it's fast enough to keep responses from making you wait. Ask a robot something, and it replies right away. It's pretty stellar.</p><div><blockquote><p>Each robot's responses are not only quick and impressively natural-feeling, but they run on an efficient custom LLM that will keep this as a one-time purchase game.</p></blockquote></div><p>Not only can you ask your virtual assistant, Visor, to transport you around the room, but you can make these commands with as much or as little knowledge as you might have of the game's content. "Bring me to the window with the orange robot" works just as well as "Sit me at the third seat at the bar with James," or "take me to that fortune teller robot."</p><p>Keeping the conversations compelling and feeling natural relied on an input that <em>felt </em>more natural. When gamers feel bored during a conversation in VR, they often "run around and jump off of stuff," as Reimer noted.</p><p>So if the script is flipped and you can't do that, you'll find yourself fidgeting in your seat, twiddling your thumbs, or picking up objects as you have a conversation, instead. "It's like what you do when normally chatting with people you're seated across from," Reimer added, and I couldn't agree more.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS" name="stellar-cafe-official-screenshot-01" alt="An official screenshot of Stellar Cafe on the Meta Quest 3 of the entire cafe and its robot denizens" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/U5HfcBqpYRAkxjaPsCZadS.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Astrobeam)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After spending 30 minutes convincing robots they needed to go to the biggest party of the year, I was convinced that I needed to play the full Stellar Cafe game when it debuted later this year. Reimer's previous chops are rooted in Job Simulator and other Owlchemy Games titles, and it shows in his new company's first release.</p><p>Gone are the days of dialog trees and repeating NPC talk in games. Instead, these characters feel like actual sentient beings in a fantasy world. It's a new era of VR gaming and a unique chapter in the history of the medium, as well, and I can't wait to be a part of it!</p> ]]></dc:content>

The post cites an "industry insider," who stated, "While Samsung is responsible for the hardware portion of its partnership with Google, Google also conducts internal hardware research and prepares for the future, so Samsung must also develop its own brand."</p><p>With Samsung seemingly looking to step away from Google—at least for this supposed device—rumors theorize on its design, which could be "display-less." The publication likens it to what we've received with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-gen-3">Ray-Ban Meta</a> smartglasses, which only provide a camera, speaker, and microphone for users.</p><p>Rumors purport that Samsung is interested in establishing itself in the smart glasses game through this standalone release. More than that, the idea of creating "display-less" smart glasses would help Samsung appeal to the market without driving up costs.</p><p>Early rumors claim these smart glasses could debut sometime during the "end of 2026." Samsung's AI would have a great role to play in these glasses, furthering the alleged comparison (and potential competition) between it at the Ray-Ban line.</p><h2 id="not-project-haean-but-that-s-still-on-the-table-2">Not "Project HAEAN," but that's still on the table</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG" name="android-xr-smart-glasses-concept-02" alt="A lifestyle image showing off a prototype pair of smart glasses powered by Android XR" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Ynuoir6wBUdePdHywfUwfG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>We've been slowly hearing more and more about Samsung's interest in developing smart glasses, but those whispers were about <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-gear/samsung-could-be-working-smart-glasses">its collaboration with Google</a>. In March, a report claimed that Samsung was developing a pair of smart glasses under the project name "HAEAN." These glasses would be a mixed reality pair, something that could go up against the RayBan Meta alternative.</p><p>Project HAEAN is speculated to deliver displays that could showcase "information or images" on its lenses. Additionally, the pair could sport "multiple" cameras, and give users the ability to make payments and understand their gestures.</p><p>A month later, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-android-xr-smart-glasses-ted-2025">Google had a TED demo</a>, which highlighted a pair of smart glasses that pretty much showed off everything we'd <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/google-may-have-shown-off-ar-glasses-prototype-at-io-2024">seen hinted at during I/O</a>.

According to the Telegram post, the company is seemingly working on a way for users to practice new languages, similar to Duolingo. Mehrad was able to screenshot a "Practice Spanish" menu, which displays the user's goal (how well they want to speak), Daily Activities, and Words Practiced.</p><p>Also, it was nearly cut off, but there's a button that says "create your own practice scenario," which could come in handy if you're trying to gauge your abilities in specific situations.</p><p>On the other hand, the publication, alongside tipster AssembleDebug, dove into the Translate app's code to discover a new graduation cap icon representing "Practice." Google's tagline reads, "practice with AI-powered conversations." The app gives several "recommended" scenarios, encompassing both listening and speaking practices. When listening, users are given an audio clip and asked to tap which words they recognize.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:450px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9" name="google-translate-practice-language-leak" alt="A leaked screenshot of Google Translate's supposed "practice" feature to help users learn new languages." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MoxG7pXc2M6MDAxAZUmny9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="450" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mehrad / Telegram)</span></figcaption></figure><p>After it's done, and you've seen how well you faired, the Translate app lets users adjust the difficulty of its generated scenarios.</p><p>When creating a pretend custom speaking scenario, the tipster highlights the ability for users to write their own situation or choose a recommended one. From there, users are presented with a selection of "tasks" to complete before getting the chance to speak into the app. There's also a "proficiency" level users can select, which is how well they're able to speak the language they want to learn. The post states there were options present for "Just Starting, Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced."</p><p>The tipster also discovered a quiz function that's created using "rounds." From both Mehrad's screenshot on Telegram and the tipster's APK deep dive, it seems Google Translate's language learning feature is nearly completed. There's no telling when it could arrive officially, but perhaps it's soon.</p><h2 id="breaking-barriers-2">Breaking barriers</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:75.00%;"><img id="WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP" name="google-pixel-6-pro-translate-03.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro Translate" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WDFPNnxYttq8c4MaE2kcFP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nick Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier in June, we heard rumors <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-translate-design-shake-up-rumored-new-upgrades">about a design shakeup for the Google Translate</a> app that could incorporate more features.

It comes pre-installed on most Android phones, offers a clean and simple interface.</p><p>Even though the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-keep-android-testing-help-me-create-a-list">Gemini integration</a> that we've been asking for on Google Keep hasn't arrived yet, the company continues to add useful features to the app every now and then. Recently, the app received the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-unveils-the-most-massive-android-redesign-ever">Material 3 Expressive design</a> update, and now a long-requested sorting feature is arriving.</p><p>With the new update, Keep users can sort notes by "date created" or "date modified". Previously, the app displayed notes in the order they were created, with the most recent at the top. Even if you updated an older note, its position wouldn't change, making it harder to quickly find your latest edits without searching or scrolling through multiple notes.</p><h2 id="sorting-finally-comes-to-google-keep-on-android-2">Sorting finally comes to Google Keep on Android</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:320px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:214.38%;"><img id="aPGaAEARUqhUxvuf8gHzch" name="google-keep-sort-notes" alt="Sorting Google Keep notes on Android" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/aPGaAEARUqhUxvuf8gHzch.gif" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="320" height="686" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The new feature fixes that by allowing you to instantly see which note was updated recently. A sort icon now appears in the search bar next to your profile picture. Tapping this icon opens a dialog box where you can choose your sorting method.</p><p>Tapping once sorts from latest to oldest, and tapping again reverses it. From what we've seen, the sorting resets to default when you close the app, but you can easily change it again with a single tap.</p><p>The feature is rolling out now with the latest version of Google Keep on the Play Store, and it's currently exclusive to Android. Even though Keep relies heavily on web-based content, the feature isn't available on desktop, and even iOS users don't have it yet.</p><p>Considering Google often launches new features on iOS first, it's a nice change to see Android users getting the update ahead of everyone else.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The company stated it was looking to release this new hub for its creative-focused features in August, and we're seeing that appear now in the bottom navigation bar.</p><p>From the "Create" tab, users will have easy access to features like Collage, Cinematic Photos, Animations (GIF creation), and Highlight Videos.</p><p>However, as the publication notes, Google Photos is looking to draw attention to its most recently added capabilities, like photo-to-video generation (which is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/gemini-photo-to-video-animates-images-veo-3-model-rollout">also in Gemini</a>). Users engaging with this feature can locate a photo in their gallery that they'd like the app to breathe some AI life into. Essentially, your photo will show some movement, making the person or people in it move a little or make a cool gesture, like celebrating.</p><p>Version 7.40 is also reportedly bringing a small plus icon at the top of the Create tab, right beside your Google Account icon. This is a drop-down menu that houses many of the same options you'd find just by scrolling the Create tab. The publication notes that while v7.40 of the Photos app has been spotted, it's not available for every device just yet, so more users will likely see it as we end the week.</p><h2 id="get-creating-2">Get Creating</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:282px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:212.77%;"><img id="9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H" name="google-photos-create-tab-example" alt="Google is preparing a new hub for AI generative functions in its Photos app called "Create."" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9jA74nGsvAqBBXW6Et4s7H.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="282" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Google Photos was part of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-creative-photo-to-video-remix-rollout">a huge announcement post</a> in July that detailed the creative updates that were inbound. In this post, the company detailed its upcoming photo-to-video generation capabilities and its Remix option, which could restyle your photos into Anime, 3D animation, and more. However, wrapping up all of this nicely is the "Create" tab.</p><p>All of the AI features that Google Photos provides will be housed directly in this new Create tab. Users can quickly hop into any of them from this tab, select the photos they'd like to mess with, and proceed without a hitch (hopefully). Google stated in July that the new tab would arrive for U.S. users first, before extending to other places.</p><p>There will almost certainly be a follow-up update at a later date from Google once other regions are ready to go.</p><p>Another post this week from Google gave users <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-photos-explains-how-remix-will-work-availability-upcoming">an in-depth look at how its Remix feature</a> will work in the app. Remix isn't widely available just yet, but this explainer makes sure we're ready to rock once it is.</p> ]]></dc:content>

While there's no official confirmation of its purpose, this design is similar to what we've seen in Apple's official iPhone cases and third-party Pixel cases that enable MagSafe-like functionality.</p><p>This doesn't mean the Pixel 10 series won't offer Qi2 or MagSafe-like support natively. According to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/pixel-10-leak-shows-signs-of-magnetic-qi2-charging-finally-arriving">previous rumors</a>, the Pixel 10 line is expected to be the first flagship smartphone in the U.S. to include Qi2 wireless charging built in.

The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-7-review">Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> is one of the thinnest foldables you can buy today, and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/should-you-buy-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-7">Z Flip 7</a> has noticeable upgrades. Having used both foldables for the better part of two weeks, I'll have to say that I enjoyed the Z Flip 7 better.</p><p>I usually prefer fold-out designs, but in this instance, I used the Z Flip 7 over the Fold 7. That's mostly down to the bigger cover panel; the increased real estate makes a noticeable difference in daily use, and the portability of the device is unmatched. Unlike last year, the cover panel now extends to the entire width of the device when folded, putting the device in contention with Motorola's foldables.</p><p>The outer panel finally gets 120Hz refresh as well, and it's just better to use than last year. The 4.1-inch OLED panel has good colors and vibrancy, and the bigger panel makes it easier to get back to notifications and messages without having to unfold the device.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-9" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lv9zZPspiFNQmLc54eR3NP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Annoyingly, Samsung doesn't allow you to use apps on the outer panel, but this is easily addressed by using CoverScreen OS. This is where Motorola's phones have an inherent advantage, and Samsung should consider changing its stance to make it easier to use the increased panel size on the outside.</p><p>While the overall brightness still isn't as high as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, I didn't see any issues in regular use — even under harsh sunlight. The design itself is thinner than last year, and that is another point in Samsung's favor this year; the brand did a good job delivering sleeker foldables. Another positive is that the device gets 256GB of storage with the base model, with Samsung finally eschewing 128GB.</p><p>And even though the Z Flip 7 uses the Exynos 2500 globally, I didn't run into any lag or slowdowns. Foldables generally don't have extensive thermal management, and the result is that they tend to throttle sooner than regular phones. That is the case with the Z Flip 7 as well, but it is in line with other flip phones I used recently.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fZ3cjfSZAmGvv7bo5VXAf8" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Z-Flip-7-Review-7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fZ3cjfSZAmGvv7bo5VXAf8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The only point of contention on the Z Flip 7 is the battery; while the 4,300mAh battery is bigger than last year, it still isn't as big as what other manufacturers offer on their own devices. Samsung is clearly not willing to put massive batteries on its foldables, and that's something it will eventually need to address if it wants to measure up to its Chinese rivals.</p><p>Having said that, the Z Flip 7 manages to last a day with medium use. I had to plug it in on days with heavy use involving navigation and gaming, but on the whole, battery life is better than last year. Samsung is heavily positioning Galaxy AI as a differentiator, and the Z Flip 7 runs <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/android-os/android-16-review">Android 16</a> out of the box.</p><p>The software is immediately familiar, but it has enough new features to excite long-term users. While I don't use AI features as such, it's undeniable that Galaxy AI has a robust suite of utilities geared at image generation and editing along with text-based assistance.</p><p>On the whole, the Z Flip 7 is a definite move forward, and Samsung addressed long-standing issues with its flip phones with the device. It's better to hold and use, is faster than last year, and the cameras are quite decent — honestly, I didn't think it would be as enjoyable to use.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="bff15981-3597-4457-93da-58bd639c78b7">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SnVAEkbBa3ziMj85fokzMb.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p>Thanks to a bigger cover panel and better internals, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 is fantastic to use. </p></p>                </div>                            </div>        </div> ]]></dc:content>

Additionally, you could likely just backtrack, select a different photo, and repeat the process either with the same style or a totally new style. If you're still encountering difficulties, Google states photos that are well-lit, in focus, and with only a handful of subjects facing the camera yield the best results.

Google states this feature will "give you a personalized experience when it learns from your past chats." This is essentially a memory-based feature that enables Gemini to remember certain things about you, like your likes, dislikes, and preferences for certain aspects of your life.</p><p>Google offers some examples, stating users who've previously asked Gemini to summarize some popular non-fiction books on BookTok will likely receive book suggestions based on those previously summarized genres.</p><p>Additionally, if you've previously discussed comic books with Gemini and you're looking for birthday party ideas later on, the AI might pull from that older conversation about Batman or Green Arrow to help you with decorations.</p><p>While users retain the choice to have "personal context" on or off, Google states you can delete any past chats via Gemini App Activity. This feature is rolling out today (Aug 13), bringing personalized chats to the Gemini 2.5 Pro model first in "select" countries.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.20%;"><img id="BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN" name="google-gemini-personal-context-example" alt="Google's Gemini app picks up "personal context," a feature that lets the AI automatically pull important details about a person from past chats to use for future queries." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BYQAovx24uAZVAkbQqshpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1000" height="562" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from personalization, Google states its second Gemini update focuses on user privacy and for those who don't want the AI to callback to certain questions. Temporary Chats is a new feature users can call on for "one-off" questions they may have for the AI. Google says things you ask about won't be remembered by Gemini, and they won't appear in the "recent chats" list in the sidebar.</p><p>Google also states things discussed in Temporary Chats won't be used to train its AI model, either. This feature is rolling out today (Aug 13) and will continue to reach more users "over the coming weeks."</p><p>The post then highlights a new setting to help users better control their data with the AI model. Soon, the app's "Gemini Apps Activity" setting will be renamed to "Keep Activity." If enabled, Google gives the following statement: "A sample of your future uploads will be used to help improve Google services for everyone." It's worth noting that this applies to uploads in the Gemini made from September 2, 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Users can easily turn this off when it appears for them within their Gemini app settings.</p><h2 id="an-updated-saved-info-feature-2">An updated 'Saved Info' feature?</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:600px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="FufNJhX6gQAHvNWCZebUDD" name="google-gemini-temporary-chats" alt="The Gemini app is rolling out Temporary Chats, which the AI will not callback to or use for future personalization features." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FufNJhX6gQAHvNWCZebUDD.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="600" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Late last year, Google rolled out "<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-gemini-saved-info-rollout-detailed">Saved Info</a>" for the Gemini app. To be brief, Saved Info lets users ask Gemini to remember certain things about them.

It's a step up over the Watch 2 where it matters, and pandered to me with some fun running software tools.</p><p>However, Google's iffy software strategy and some strong rivals eventually killed my Pixel Watch 3 honeymoon period. Fortunately, Gemini has made things exciting again.</p><h2 id="doing-its-best-with-older-tech-2">Doing its best with older tech</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm" name="google-pixel-watch-3-metal-link-band-close-up-1.jpg" alt="Pixel Watch 3 with Metal Link Band Close-up" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/to9FczSGrrjWUQjNfCZHAm.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>I don't know if the Pixel Watch 4 will <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch/pixel-watch-4-might-stick-with-the-same-chip-as-its-predecessors">stick with last year's processor</a> or use a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os/qualcomms-next-wear-os-chipset-could-arrive-in-2025">new Snapdragon processor</a>. Either way, it's impressive how Cortex-A53 cores (made in 2012, before "Android Wear" existed) can power the Pixel Watch 3 so well that I've never dealt with any lag or major crashes.</p><p>When I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/i-tested-early-wear-os-6-build-on-pixel-watch-3-at-google-io-2025">tried Wear OS 6 on a Watch 3</a> at Google I/O, I was amazed at how smoothly the unfinished software ran.

Now that Gemini is a signature feature, every pixel of space for text is useful.</p><p>Even better, it has extra battery capacity, easily outperforming Google's 24-hour-with-AOD estimate. During my initial review period, I was hitting two days with sleep tracking and the occasional GPS workout. These days, it's closer to 36 hours, with hours to spare, since I rarely use it for sleep tracking.</p><p>Of course, I would like better battery life.

Vats spotted build numbers for the S24, S24 Plus, and S24 Ultra in the region, marking the start of their beta program. Samsung's official changelog appearing on devices states U.K. users will find a ~3GB download size for One UI 8.</p><p>Moreover, the changelog informs users that only the unlocked version of the S24 models is eligible for this test. The August 1 security patch is also rolling in for users who're signing up for the beta program in the U.K.</p><p>A <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://x.com/tarunvats33/status/1955549558282375210">separate X post states</a> the One UI 8 beta is starting in South Korea for the Galaxy S24 series, as well as the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and the Fold 6. While the program's appearance in these two countries indicates its slow rollout around the world, some users are reporting a curious occurrence in India. Some users seeking out the beta program in India report a banner that says "recruitment closed." It's left many users on X bewildered as to what's going on.</p><p>Perhaps this will be rectified as the week winds down.

Upon closer examination of the images in the Goofish listing, these accessories carry the GM0KF model number,  a “Designed for Google” badge, and Google’s logo on the button at the top of the stylus.

According to multiple outlets, including <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-12/perplexity-makes-34-5-billion-bid-for-google-s-chrome-browser">Bloomberg</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ai-startup-perplexity-makes-bold-345-billion-bid-googles-chrome-browser-2025-08-12/">Reuters</a>, Perplexity has made an "all-cash" offer of $34.5 billion to purchase Chrome.</p><p>This isn't the first time Perplexity has shown interest in buying Chrome. The company has <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/654835/perplexity-google-antitrust-trial-remedies-chrome">previously stated</a> it believes it could operate Chrome at the same scale as Google without charging users.</p><p>The Reuters report claims that Perplexity's term sheet for the deal says that it would keep the Chromium browser open-source, invest over $3 billion over two years, and make no changes to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-change-your-default-search-engine-chrome">Chrome's default search engine</a> if the offer goes through.</p><p>Perplexity hasn't explained how it plans to fund the deal, given its own valuation is less than half the offer. However, reports say the company has unnamed backers willing to finance the purchase in full.</p><h2 id="perplexity-s-big-falls-far-below-chrome-s-estimated-value-2">Perplexity's big falls far below Chrome's estimated value</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AYoyAck3KRRVr57NN7jRe4" name="Google-Pixel-7-boot-screen-Google-logo.jpg" alt="The Google logo on the Google Pixel 7's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AYoyAck3KRRVr57NN7jRe4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, Google doesn't appear interested in selling Chrome.

Federal judge Amit Mehta is expected to rule this month on possible remedies, which could include forcing Google to sell Chrome.</p><p>Even so, industry sources say Perplexity's offer is far below Chrome's estimated value of at least $50 billion. The situation is also puzzling given that Perplexity recently launched "Comet," an AI-powered browser built on the Chromium project.</p><p>Perplexity is already a familiar name in the AI space, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-explores-perplexity-ai-integration-to-rival-gemini-on-galaxy-s26-series">companies like Samsung</a> and Motorola reportedly <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/ai/perplexity-ai-motorola-samsung-agreement-discussions-reported">exploring it as a default assistant</a> for their smartphones. Still, this bid suggests the startup's ambitions stretch far beyond that.</p><p>Google has yet to publicly comment on the offer but is expected to appeal any forced sale and, according to reports, is prepared to "fight for years" if necessary.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The tipster's social media post states the device went through its performance test using Qualcomm's upcoming Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 SoC. The listing states the phone scored 3,393 in its single-core test and 11,515 in its multi-core test.</p><p>However, these numbers are suspected to be a bit higher once the device comes out, if this model at Geekbench is indeed the S26 Edge. The publication noticed that the phone was given the test with a 4GHz CPU, which is .74GHz under what was listed for the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2. Chip data states it supposedly sports two cores at 4.74GHz and six cores at 3.63GHz.</p><p>Other, smaller specifications state the device was tested with its Android 16 OS and 12GB of RAM with the Adreno 840 GPU.</p><h2 id="an-edge-over-the-plus-2">An Edge over the Plus</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY" name="Samsung-Galaxy-S25-Edge-1" alt="The front of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iyfHD4EVDT9WakH8SfuSyY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>What's unclear is if we're seeing the Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 "For Galaxy" <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-true-snapdragon-8-elite-2-2nm-process-qualcomm-chip-rumor">that was rumored in June</a> or not.

This would be special for the models as a 3nm node version would be made by TSMC for everyone else.</p><p>These rumors were reportedly still lingering as Samsung's head of foundry, Han Jin-man, was supposedly still awaiting a green light to move forward with these ambitions. Samsung's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-2nm-process-production-plans">had a 2nm process chip</a> in its headspace for a while now, so maybe this will happen.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that major rumors claim Samsung <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-could-drop-its-plus-variant-for-the-edge-shaking-up-the-galaxy-s26-lineup">is kicking out its Plus model for the Edge</a>. This would mean consumers would see a Galaxy S26, S26 Edge, and S26 Ultra next year. It's an interesting rumor, considering the Plus model, in 2024, saw a popularity boost, selling about 7.4 million units, a ~54% boost over its predecessor in 2023. Additional rumors allege the S26 Edge could be <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/samsung-thinner-larger-battery-galaxy-s26-edge-rumors">even thinner with new battery tech</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

And yet, the Pixel 10 Pro XL might look like a completely different product than the Pixel 8 Pro. In only a few generations, Google pivoted its design language and delivered an enhanced feature set. That could help the Pixel 10 Pro XL look like a major upgrade compared to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>That doesn't necessarily mean every <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-pro-review">Google Pixel 8 Pro</a> owner will want to trade in their trusty handset for a brand new one. It's up for debate whether the newer Pixel 10 Pro XL design is actually better — many Pixel fans like the old camera bar and pebble-shaped design. If you're on the fence, let's compare how the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a> might stack up against the Pixel 8 Pro in this speculative breakdown.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide" target="_blank"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-pricing-and-availability-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Pricing and availability</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-back-porcelain-01.jpg" alt="The matte glass on the back of the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/47po7vPbimkNg6taSyW5KC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>If your last smartphone purchase was the Pixel 8 Pro, the rumored price tag of the Pixel 10 Pro XL might sting. Google is expected to cut the 128GB, entry-level variant of the Pixel 10 Pro XL, meaning the phone will start at 256GB and cost $1,199 as a result. You can upgrade to 512GB or 1TB configurations for an even higher cost. It's rumored to be available in Obsidian, Moonstone, Porcelain, and Jade colorways.</p><p>We'll likely see the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL for the first time at a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/made-by-google-2025-how-to-watch-pixel-10-launch-and-what-to-expect" target="_blank">Made by Google event</a> for Aug. 20, beginning at 1 p.m. ET. The company hinted that we'll see the latest on "Pixel phones, watches, buds, and more," which is a clear reference to new phones like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-10" target="_blank">Pixel 10 Pro XL</a>. Pre-orders could open as soon as that same day, with traditional retail availability starting Aug. 28.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Google Pixel 8 Pro launched on Oct. 12, 2023 at a retail price of $999. It's available in Black, Porcelain, and Bay colorways, and starts at 128GB with upgrades up to 1TB available. In 2025, you can still find the Pixel 8 Pro for sale at the Google Store and at partner retailers for as low as $599.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The shift from the Google Pixel 8 Pro to the Google Pixel 9 series brought a slew of changes, both in design and nomenclature. The Pixel 8 Pro is the phone that would now be considered the "Pro XL" variant, so it's important to remember it is roughly the same size as the upcoming Pixel 10 Pro XL. While the Pixel 10 Pro XL isn't rumored to be a huge upgrade over the Pixel 9 Pro XL, two years of upgrades are compounding here compared to the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL has the new boxy and rectangular design language, with flat side rails and a slight chamfer. There's also the pill-shaped camera bar on the back and simply fewer curves overall. By comparison, the Pixel 8 Pro has the older pebble-shaped design language with strong curves and an in-hand feel that some might prefer from a comfort standpoint. It also has the more traditional camera bar that extends from edge to edge.</p><p>You'll have to decide which design style you prefer, as there are major differences between the Pixel 10 Pro XL and the Pixel 8 Pro. From an objective standpoint, the older Pixel 8 Pro is expected to be lighter, weighing 213 grams. Newer Pixel phones keep getting heavier, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL might weigh 232 grams this year.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="LmWknuwaArYGhwNhZ6FWzB" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-display-01.jpg" alt="The bright display on the Google Pixel 8 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LmWknuwaArYGhwNhZ6FWzB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The form factor of the two phones will be mostly the same, with the Pixel 10 Pro XL being slightly thinner than the Pixel 8 Pro — the difference is 85mm vs. 8.8mm. This isn't exactly surprising, because the major design changes are carryovers from the Pixel 9 Pro XL.</p><p>Notably, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will have a larger and brighter display. It's expected to measure 6.8 inches, and the AMOLED panel will support at least 3,000 nits of peak brightness. The Pixel 8 Pro has a slightly smaller 6.7-inch AMOLED display topping out at 2,400 nits of peak brightness. Both phones have LTPO technology and can fluctuate between 1Hz and 120Hz refresh rates situationally.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG" name="Google-Pixel-8-Pro-camera-bar-01.jpg" alt="Google Pixel 8 Pro camera bar in the porcelain colorway" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/AriHAnbWjHYfa6q4QWWvVG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>In terms of durability, both phones have IP68 protection against dust and water ingress, as well as Gorilla Glass Victus 2.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-hardware-and-specs-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Hardware and specs</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1275px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:64.39%;"><img id="MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG" name="pixel-10-magsafe-charging-leak" alt="Leaked image of Pixel 10 showcasing Pixesnap MagSafe-like wireless charging" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/MMjBc85Fui37azvpDwp9sG.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1275" height="821" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Evan Blass / X)</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the inside, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will pack a bigger punch than the Pixel 8 Pro. It comes down to chipset and memory — the newer phone will feature a more advanced processor and 16GB of RAM. It should perform better than the Pixel 8 Pro as a result, which only has 12GB of memory and runs on the older Tensor G3 platform. Luckily, Google fixed overheating problems with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-tensor-g3-best-phone-chip-today">Tensor G3, </a>but speeds are less than desirable in certain situations.</p><p>Google is reportedly swinging for the fences with the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tag/google-tensor-g5">Tensor G5 chip</a> in the Pixel 10 Pro XL. It's said to be the first Google chip to be fabricated using TSMC's 3nm process node, which is the same one used by Apple and Qualcomm.

The front-facing camera is now a 42MP, f/2.2 sensor — up from the 10.5MP, f/2.2 sensor on the Pixel 8 Pro. Otherwise, both phones should have a 50MP main sensor, a 48MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, and a 48MP ultrawide camera.</p><p>Rounding out the hardware improvements expected for the Pixel 10 Pro XL are battery and charging upgrades. The new model should have a 5,200mAh battery capacity with support for faster charging speeds. We could see 39W wired speeds, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/accessories/power-charging/wpc-announces-qi2-25w-major-android-devices-certification-new-standard">Qi2 25W wireless charging support</a>, and 5W reverse wireless charging.</p><p>Faster charging, longer battery life, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/another-pixel-10-series-leak-info-on-specifications-buds-2a">magnetic Qi2 support</a> are key reasons to pick a Pixel 10 Pro XL over the Pixel 8 Pro.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-8-pro-which-should-you-buy-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 8 Pro: Which should you buy? </h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-03" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The choice between the upcoming Google Pixel 10 Pro XL and the existing Pixel 8 Pro is tempting, regardless of whether you're looking at upgrading or buying either phone outright. At under $600, the Google Pixel 8 Pro is about half the price of a Pixel 10 Pro XL, which makes you think about whether the soon-to-be-released model is really twice as good. If I was in the market for a new Pixel, I'd at least <em>think</em> about whether a Pixel 8 Pro would meet my needs for a seriously-low price.</p><p>That said, the Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to pack a lineup of compelling upgrades over older models like the Pixel 8 Pro. The highlights include a fast, AI-centric Tensor G5 processor, Qi2 25W support with built-in magnets, and a bigger battery. If those hardware improvements sound exciting, it might be worth trying to get your hands on a Pixel 10 Pro XL.</p><p>We'll learn more about the Pixel 10 Pro XL when it is officially announced later this month. Until then, everything we know about it is speculative, so we can't say for sure whether it'll be a slam-dunk upgrade over the Pixel 8 Pro or not.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="6c952fc1-ff08-485e-ba4d-64b97b297657">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>Pixel perfect</strong></em></p><p>Aside from the weight, there's a lot to like about the rumored Pixel 10 Pro XL.

That would mean the Pixel 10 Pro XL will start at 256GB at a price point of $1,199. It's the same price as the 256GB Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the removal of the entry-level model raises the price floor. Upgrades to 512GB and 1TB configurations will be available, and it's rumored to be sold in Obsidian, Moonstone, Porcelain, and Jade colorways.</p><p>Google launched the current Pixel 9 Pro XL on Aug. 22, 2024. The phone starts with 128GB of storage and retails for $1,099, with optional storage upgrades up to 1TB available. You can grab it in Obsidian (black), Porcelain (white), Hazel (grey), and Rose Quartz (pink) colorways. As the phone gets older, it is more prone to discounts. We could see the Pixel 9 Pro XL priced more aggressively when the newer version releases.</p><h2 id="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-vs-pixel-9-pro-xl-design-and-display-2">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL vs. Pixel 9 Pro XL: Design and display</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2000px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/eFEDDjbkX78LvYZpWrNocb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2000" height="1125" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>From the outside, we expect the Google Pixel 10 Pro XL to look quite similar to the Pixel 9 Pro XL. You'll have the same general design language consistent across both phones, from the polished aluminum side rails to the pill-shaped camera bar. In fact, the dimensions of the Pixel 10 Pro XL are expected to be identical to those of its predecessor, measuring 162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/thinborne-designed-pixel-10-cases-sold-out">Early case samples suggest</a> that a tweak to the camera bar size might nix compatibility with older cases, though.</p><p>The weight could be a different story. The newer model is expected to weigh 232 grams, and that's hefty even for a phone of this size. For perspective, the Pixel 9 Pro XL weighs 221 grams and the Pixel 8 Pro weighs 213 grams. It's an unfortunate trend — Pixel flagships keep getting heavier, and this is a difference you'll feel in your hand and pocket.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="Sa9j5BACE8L2VkFyJpDj2b" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-hazel-back-2025-02" alt="The Hazel Google Pixel 9 Pro XL" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Sa9j5BACE8L2VkFyJpDj2b.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Pixel 10 Pro XL is rumored to have similar display specs as the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

The Pixel 9 Pro XL's resolution is 2992 x 1344 pixels, and that might carry over to the 2025 model. For protection, we'll get Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on the front and rear glass.</p><p>Rounding out the Pixel 10 Pro XL's durability suite is an IP68 certification, which is just about standard in 2025. It'll provide a solid amount of protection against dust and water ingress.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1066px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.29%;"><img id="FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb" name="google-pixel-10-pro-xl-renders-03" alt="Google Pixel 10 Pro XL renders" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/FfZJRaEcoQWnmFWGPDHobb.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1066" height="600" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Headlines/ via OnLeaks)</span></figcaption></figure><p>With so few design changes, colors will be a key differentiator.

This year, we expect to see the first Pixel to feature a Tensor G5 processor manufactured by TSMC. The Google Tensor G5 chip is said to be built using TSMC's advanced 3nm process node, leading to increased performance. The company is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google/is-googles-switch-from-samsung-foundry-to-tsmc-for-the-tensor-g5-chip-a-big-deal">reportedly also switching to more custom components for the G5</a>, potentially improving efficiency and optimization.</p><p>Google isn't expected to change the camera hardware found on the Pixel 9 Pro XL — the exact same setup should appear on the Pixel 10 Pro XL. However, a move to Tensor G5 could be just one way the company squeezes out better shots from the same sensors and lenses.</p><div ><table><thead><tr><th class="firstcol " ><p>Category</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 10 Pro XL (rumored/assumed)</p></th><th  ><p>Google Pixel 9 Pro XL</p></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Display</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch LTPO OLED, 120Hz, HDR10+, 3000 nits (peak)</p></td><td  ><p>6.8-inch Super Actua display, 120Hz LTPO OLED (1-120Hz), 2992 x 1344, HDR, 3000 nits, Gorilla Glass Victus 2, 240Hz PWM dimming</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Processor</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G5</p></td><td  ><p>Google Tensor G4, Titan M2 security module</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Memory</p></td><td  ><p>16GB</p></td><td  ><p>16GB RAM</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Storage</p></td><td  ><p>256GB, 512GB, 1TB</p></td><td  ><p>128GB / 256GB / 512GB / 1TB</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Front Camera</p></td><td  ><p>42 MP, f/2.2</p></td><td  ><p>42MP f/2.2, 103-degree FoV, Dual PD, autofocus</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 1</p></td><td  ><p>50 MP, f/1.7 wide</p></td><td  ><p>50MP f/1.68, 1/1.31" sensor, Octa PDAF, 82-degree FoV, OIS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 2</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/1.7 ultrawide</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/1.7, 1/2.55" sensor, 123-degree wide-angle, macro, autofocus, Quad-PD</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Rear Camera 3</p></td><td  ><p>48 MP, f/2.8 5x periscope telephoto</p></td><td  ><p>48MP f/2.8, 1/2.55" sensor, 22-degree FoV, macro, autofocus, Quad-PD, Multi-zone LDAF, 5x optical zoom</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Camera Features</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td><td  ><p>Best Take, Add Me, Magic Editor</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Battery</p></td><td  ><p>5,200mAh</p></td><td  ><p>5,060mAh</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Charging</p></td><td  ><p>39W wired, 23W wireless</p></td><td  ><p>37W wired charging, 23W wireless charging, 5W reverse wireless charging </p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Connectivity</p></td><td  ><p>5G, Wi-Fi 7, UWB</p></td><td  ><p>Wi-Fi 7, 5G (mmWave and Sub-6), Bluetooth 5.3, NFC, AptX HD, USB-C 3.2, Physical and eSIM, Satellite SOS</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Biometrics</p></td><td  ><p>Ultrasonic Fingerprint Scanner, Face Recognition</p></td><td  ><p>Under display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, face unlock</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Ingress Protection</p></td><td  ><p>IP68, Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 (front and rear glass)</p></td><td  ><p>IP68 dust and water resistance</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Dimensions</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5 mm</p></td><td  ><p>162.8 x 76.6 x 8.5mm</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Weight</p></td><td  ><p>232 grams</p></td><td  ><p>221g</p></td></tr><tr><td class="firstcol " ><p>Software</p></td><td  ><p>Android 16</p></td><td  ><p>Android 15 (upgradeable to Android 16)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Google has a lot riding on Tensor G5, because the Tensor G4 found in the Pixel 9 Pro XL is underwhelming compared to the competition.

It's rumored to sport a 5,200mAh battery, up from the 5,060mAh capacity of the Pixel 9 Pro XL. This might be one reason why the Pixel 10 Pro XL is heavier. Another could be the inclusion of Qi2 magnets for quick connectivity with chargers and accessories.

There won't be new camera hardware or a design refresh this year, although that isn't exactly surprising. Instead, the Tensor G5 chipset should bring considerable performance and optimization improvements. The rumored Qi2 magnetic support and 25W fast wireless charging capabilities might make a big difference in daily use.</p><p>At the same time, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will look and feel mostly the same as the Pixel 9 Pro XL. There's no better evidence of that than the devices' rumored dimensions — both are expected to measure exactly the same. Given that the Pixel 9 Pro XL is already running Android 16 and has six more years of updates, there's no reason to get rid of this flagship phone anytime soon.</p><p>As usual, the Pixel 10 Pro XL will seem a lot more appealing to people with older Pixels that have waited longer to upgrade. That said, some features — like Qi2 25W — are sure to make Pixel 9 Pro XL users jealous.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="57cfb4d6-2853-4081-bf9d-76240090b9ae">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/QL8HS5AC8SsigaibSHfKUW.jpg' alt="The leaked Google Pixel 10 Pro render shared by Evan Blass."></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Google Pixel 10 Pro XL</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>The future Pixel</strong></em></p><p>With the Pixel 10 Pro XL, Google will further lean into the identity of Pixel phone.

And while 3D printers are more common these days, they're not exactly omnipresent, and the process of lifting a fingerprint and creating a copy would be a challenge.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="99ohBLMNVw2MAuAeVe53G" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-back-with-samsung-case" alt="Looking closely at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's display" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/99ohBLMNVw2MAuAeVe53G.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Nicholas Sutrich / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, face unlock on most <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-android-phones">Android phones</a> is not as secure and is generally an option that can be fooled more easily without dedicated hardware. That's because it solely relies on a 2D image of your face to unlock, as opposed to a 3D scan, similar to the iPhone's TrueDepth Face ID system or even the ToF sensor on the 2019 LG G8 (or Galaxy S10 5G).</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/samsung-galaxy/which-samsung-galaxy-s25-model-should-you-buy">Galaxy S25</a> facial biometrics, while seemingly safer and more reliable than previous generations, don't appear to have significantly improved on the security front. When setting up face unlock, Samsung warns that the feature is less secure "because there is some possibility that someone who looks like you or who uses an image of your face could unlock your phone." This means it can't be used for security measures beyond unlocking your phone, such as mobile payments.</p><p>Meanwhile, Pixel phones since the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-review">Pixel 8</a> meet Google's <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel-8-face-unlock-upgrade">Class 3 biometrics standard</a>, thanks to their use of AI in tandem with camera data to enhance the accuracy of the camera. This means it can't be as easily fooled and has been determined secure enough for more sensitive security features.</p><p>So, the fingerprint sensor is your best security measure if you want to keep your Galaxy S25 secure, as it's not easily fooled. And with either option, Samsung still requires a secondary measure, such as a pin, passcode, or pattern.</p> ]]></dc:content>

You just have to ensure that you go through the steps to enable the related features on your Galaxy S25 to better protect your data.</p><p>One such feature is Secure Folder, which allows you to hide your personal data on your device and secure it behind a passcode. This includes things like images, files, contacts, and more, all of which will live in a duplicate but secure version of their respective apps.</p><p>To get started, navigate to <strong>Settings > Security and privacy > More security settings > Secure Folder</strong>.</p><p>However, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/samsungs-most-secure-feature-seems-to-have-a-few-holes">nothing is foolproof</a>, and there's a possibility that some bad actors are trying really hard to access your data. Some may even succeed. That's not meant to scare you, but it should keep you wary of where and how your data is being stored. That's why you should periodically review your phone's security and privacy settings.</p><p>That said, it's unlikely that someone is trying to take <em>your </em>data specifically.

The teaser also shows off the device's selfie camera at the top right corner of its inner display, which could arrive at 10MP during launch.</p><h2 id="ask-more-of-your-phone-2">"Ask more of your phone"</h2><div class="youtube-video" data-nosnippet ><div class="video-aspect-box"><iframe data-lazy-priority="low" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KFdO0bpe2MQ" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div><p>Google's event for its <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">Pixel 10 series launch</a> is coming up on August 20, so we're roughly a week away from seeing everything officially.</p><p>What's almost as important is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-teaser-roasts-apple-for-dragging-its-feet-on-siri">a recent Google teaser</a> from last Monday that showed off the Pixel 10 design officially. In actuality, it was the company's second teaser <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-store-pixel-10-teaser-officially-series-design-launch-promo">after its online store</a>, but the video teaser through some shade at Apple over features that are still "coming soon." Google poked its smartphone competitor over its Siri AI upgrade that still hasn't arrived after being teased for the iPhone 16 series.</p><p>Additionally, while Apple's timeline remains vague, Google stuck its foot in the door, saying its major upgrades are coming on August 20. Both the slab Pixel 10 phone teaser and the Pixel 10 Pro Fold seemingly show off the devices in the rumored "Moonstone" color. This seems certain due to its silver sides, but we won't have to wait long to know.</p><p><em>For more news and information on Google's upcoming phones, check out our </em><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/google-pixel/google-pixel-10-series-your-ultimate-guide"><em>Ultimate Guide</em></a><em>.</em></p> ]]></dc:content>

And while users have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/198wuzt/a_year_long_study_shows_what_youve_suspected/">complained</a> about Search being filled with Reddit posts, low-quality spam sites, and excessive sponsored content, Google is finally taking steps to improve things.</p><p>The company is rolling out what it calls Preferred Sources. As the name suggests, this feature lets you tell Google your favorite and most trusted websites.</p><p>Then, when you search for something and those sites have covered it, stories from those sources will appear in the Top Stories section. Articles from your trusted sources will also appear in a new "From your sources" section on the results page.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-google-s-new-preferred-sources-feature-2">How to use Google's new Preferred Sources feature</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2560px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="c7DyCjqJ6CLEZCrZaPaoNc" name="google-search-trusted-sites" alt="Image explaining how to use Google Search's new Preferred sources feature" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/c7DyCjqJ6CLEZCrZaPaoNc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2560" height="1440" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Google)</span></figcaption></figure><p>For now, the Preferred Sources feature is available only in India and the U.S. for users searching in English. There's no official word on a wider rollout, but it will likely expand to other regions in the future. If you are in a supported region, though, it's simple to mark your preferred sources.</p><p>In Google Search, once you've searched for a news topic, click the icon to the right of the Top Stories section and select your Preferred Sources. You can also manually search for your favorite websites here. Once done, tap Refresh results, and the page will prioritize results from your trusted websites at the top.</p><p>Google says you will still see results from other websites, but this gives you a new way to customize Search.</p><p>The feature was previously <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/google-searchs-ai-gets-new-travel-and-shopping-capabilities">tested in Google Labs</a>, and the company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/preferred-sources/">says</a> users "really value" being able to choose their own sources, which is why it's now being made available to everyone, not just those part of the Labs program.</p> ]]></dc:content>

The first two updates for Google Pay concern the company's autofill feature for payments in Chrome. The post states that when autofilling payments, U.S. shoppers will see rewards for even more credit cards. This update extends Google's support to over 100 credit cards in the U.S.</p><p>Specifically, the company states Google Pay will "help you easily see which card can score you the best benefits" when autofilling your payment information in Chrome.</p><p>Google Pay's "buy now, pay later" option when shopping online is also available for Affirm and Zip when autofilling your card information. The company says it plans to extend this autofill capability to Klarna, Afterpay, "and more coming soon." The final payment update today (Aug 12) regards users looking to send money to friends or family in global situations.</p><p>This test aims to bring a "simple and transparent" experience for users searching for the exchange rate between countries. Users will be able to view these rates in this test via <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="http://wallet.google.com/">Google Wallet's online</a> (computer) app and Search. This information will involve remittance providers such as Ria Money Transfer, Xe, and Wise.

While Amazon's version was viewed as a decent alternative for users looking for apps that the Google Play Store didn't carry, we'll still have to bid farewell to it next week on August 20. Android's the only way saying goodbye, as Amazon will (of course) keep its store available for its own devices.</p><p>As the publication states, once support is over for the Amazon App Store on Android, there's "no guarantee" that apps will continue to work on those devices. So, it's likely Android users will need to either drop those apps once the issues start popping up or find alternative options on the Google Play Store.</p><p>All app updates will end next week from the Amazon App Store, per the latest report.</p><h2 id="saying-goodbye-to-an-alternative-store-2">Saying goodbye to an alternative store</h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM" name="amazon-prime-box.jpg" alt="Amazon Prime Box" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/kuNDnfxYYqJSTdkS9qQWDM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="720" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Amazon )</span></figcaption></figure><p>Amazon <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-will-suspend-support-for-its-appstore-on-android">started informing developers</a> and consumers alike that it was going to shut down its store for Android on August 20 earlier this year. This alternative app store was available in 200 countries, bringing games and other apps to users who wanted other options. However, Amazon itself felt that there just wasn't much incentive to keep this store running for Android.</p><p>The company said in February that this move was a shift to focusing more on improving its app store experience for its own devices, rather than looping Android into the mix, too. Specifically, an Amazon statement said this move was because an "overwhelming majority of our customers currently engage with it" on its Fire Tablet, Fire TV, and such devices.</p><p>The other side was its digital currency: Amazon Coins. These coins will be discontinued, and any remaining will be refunded to users come August 20. We're also a bit wary of saying goodbye to Amazon's third-party store, due to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/apps-software/amazon-abandoning-its-appstore-only-makes-googles-lock-stronger">increased grip Google will have</a>.</p> ]]></dc:content>

For better or worse, it's not trying to build thick and battery-focused smartwatches like OnePlus or Garmin. It's also not trying to go for minimalism like Google and Fitbit. Instead, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 brings a differentiated yet practical design with a thin-and-light build and excellent software.</p><p>Switching from beefy smartwatches like the Apple Watch Ultra and Garmin Enduro 3, having to charge the Galaxy Watch 8 multiple times per day was a tough adjustment. If you can get past that drawback, though, the Galaxy Watch 8 is a nearly-perfect Wear OS device.

You can upgrade to the 44mm size for an extra $30, bringing the MSRP to $379.  Both models are available with an optional LTE upgrade costing $50 extra.</p><p>For perspective, the Galaxy Watch 8 Classic starts at $499.99, and the Galaxy Watch Ultra 2025 retails for $649.99.</p><p>Various deals on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-samsung-smartwatch">best Samsung watches</a> can make the wearables more affordable.

The company calls this a "cushion" design — it's like the circular screen is now resting on a squircle aluminum chassis, or a cushion.</p><p>The move serves two main purposes. The Galaxy Watch 8 now has a unique design language separate from the Apple Watch and competing Wear OS watches. More importantly, the larger footprint of the Galaxy Watch 8 on the wrist spreads out the internals better, allowing for a thinner form factor. Both size options measure 8.6mm thick, down from 9.7mm on the Watch 7.</p><p>The 40mm variant weighs 30 grams, and the larger 44mm size is only four grams heavier. All told, this makes the Galaxy Watch 8 one of the thinnest and lightest Wear OS smartwatches on the market. This is crucial, because it makes the Galaxy Watch 8 more comfortable to wear while working out and sleeping. To get proper health data, you'll need consistent sleep and activity tracking, and that's why the Galaxy Watch 8's slimmer design really matters.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="VsAJXLs6BB5Y3aj3ieKGNQ" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 on the workout screen by the water." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/VsAJXLs6BB5Y3aj3ieKGNQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, the daily Energy Score is the central metric of the Samsung Health suite. It grades your energy level for each day out of 100, using data points like sleep tracking, activity tracking, and more. You need to wear the Galaxy Watch 8 to bed to get an Energy Score, but that wasn't a problem due to how comfortable the new design felt.</p><p>Compared to similar features, like Garmin's Body Battery metric, I found that Samsung overestimated my energy level yet conservatively recommended activity plans. For example, I'd get an Energy Score of 87 for the day alongside a message that I should prioritize rest.</p><p>To me, those are a bit contradictory, but I'd always rather a fitness watch push extra rest instead of the alternative, which is to encourage overreaching.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Vw2crvr9aJg8wa68c99GvN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-1" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 next to the Samsung Wearable companion app." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Vw2crvr9aJg8wa68c99GvN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Fitness and health data was solid overall, with the Galaxy Watch 8 offering dual-band GPS and the Samsung BioActive sensor suite.

Even as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/wear-os-6">Wear OS 6</a> was supposed to improve efficiency, I haven't been impressed with longevity on the Galaxy Watch 8. In order to have enough charge for sleep tracking and all-day wear, I need to make time for two 30-minute charge sessions daily — one right before bed and another in the morning.</p><p>Officially, the Galaxy Watch 8 should get 30 hours on a single charge with the always-on display enabled. As always, that figure depends heavily on how much you use it and how long GPS and fitness tracking are active. I got far fewer hours of use on days when I eclipsed 150 minutes of recorded activities. It makes sense, but it's something to consider if you live a very active lifestyle.</p><p>The smartwatch does charge fairly quickly, needing about 80 minutes to get from 0% to 100%. This makes my routine of two 30-minute charges per day possible. With that being said, I find that the more you need to charge a smartwatch, the more likely you'll forget to put it back on before going on with your day. That's why I'd recommend considering the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-ultra-2">Galaxy Watch Ultra</a> if you need multi-day battery life or plan to track a lot of daily activities.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="t27YgQMa7WcgmrjambdvXN" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-7" alt="The Google Messages app on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/t27YgQMa7WcgmrjambdvXN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>There were also times when I found the One UI 8 Watch operating system to be less than intuitive. Occasionally, you'll run into situations where Wear OS 6 and One UI 8 Watch clash — there will be two ways to do the same thing. For example, you can use Google's Wear OS dictation feature <em>or</em> the one built into Samsung Keyboard. I also found myself wishing there was a dedicated app for workouts separate from Samsung Health on my watch.</p><p>Navigation on the Galaxy Watch 8 could certainly be improved overall. The digital bezel system feels as gimmicky as ever, and the two side buttons feel underutilized. If you prefer tactile buttons, I'd strongly recommend taking a look at the Classic or Ultra models. Simply having a third Quick Button to customize on the Galaxy Watch 8 would've solved many of my navigation gripes. Unfortunately, the base model is the only one not to include it.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-competition"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Competition</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-8" alt="The main app view on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tZnWBDJ4tQ2Zc9fwBbpyQM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Samsung's biggest competitor is arguably the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-3-review">Google Pixel Watch 3</a>, soon to be the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/google-pixel-watch-4">Pixel Watch 4</a>. Some might prefer the more dainty and minimalist style of the Pixel Watch compared to the very techy look of the Galaxy Watch 8. It'll also pair better with a Google Pixel phone, and could be a better pick for Android users that don't have a Google or Samsung device.</p><p>However, it's worth noting that the Pixel Watch 4 is rumored to measure around 14mm thick — practically in another category compared to the 8.6mm Galaxy Watch 8. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/oneplus-watch-3-review">OnePlus Watch 3</a> gives you the best battery life in a Wear OS watch, but like the Pixel Watch 3, it's a chonker. The large size and bulky, rugged look might not be for everyone.</p><p>Outside of the Wear OS space, it's worth reviewing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/best-garmin-smartwatch">best Garmin watches</a> if you want long battery life above all else.</p><h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-samsung-galaxy-watch-8-should-you-buy-it"><span>Samsung Galaxy Watch 8: Should you buy it?</span></h2><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4480px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="TW5bZhKwEGUKn2No2Rgyif" name="Samsung-Galaxy-Watch-8-Review-10" alt="The a running workout on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8." src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TW5bZhKwEGUKn2No2Rgyif.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4480" height="2520" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Brady Snyder / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>You have a Samsung Galaxy phone and want a first-party companion</li><li>You need a thin and light watch that will fit comfortably during workouts and sleep</li><li>You like the mix of Gemini and Samsung Health software features available on this watch</li></ul><p><strong>You shouldn't buy this if...</strong></p><ul><li>Multi-day battery life is a main priority for you, or if you track a lot of activity</li><li>You need great hardware controls, like customizable buttons or a rotating bezel</li><li>You don't like the hardware design or the One UI 8 Watch interface</li></ul><p>With generally the same sensor suite, display offerings, and processor, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8's hardware hasn't been completely overhauled. For some reason, it feels that way regardless. The switch to the squircle design isn't something you need to settle for — it's actually good. Go with a silver case color to contrast with the black display bezel, and you've got a seriously eye-catching Wear OS smartwatch.</p><p>Whether you feel compelled to upgrade to Galaxy Watch 8 will depend on your priorities. I traded in my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/wearables/samsung-galaxy-watch-6-review">Galaxy Watch 6 Classic</a> because I found it to be too bulky for daily use and running, and the Galaxy Watch 8's thin and light form factor is a breath of fresh air by comparison. On the other hand, those looking for longer battery life and faster charging will be disappointed.</p><p>Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 might be the best base-model Wear OS smartwatch to date.</p>        <div class="featured_product_block featured_block_horizontal" data-id="2412d494-403e-4c24-8854-f59afc81e306">            <div class='product-image-widthsetter'><p class='vanilla-image-block' data-bordeaux-image-check style='padding-top:100.00%';><img style='width: 100%' class='featured_image' src='https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3osjQ7T4Eof4nqKPSLadWi.jpg' alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 44mm"></p></div>            <div class="featured_product_details_wrapper">                <div class="featured_product_title_wrapper">                                                                                <div class="featured__title">Samsung Galaxy Watch 8</div>                                    </div>                <div class="subtitle__description">                                                            <p><p><em><strong>A sleek Wear OS watch</strong></em></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 is a thin and light wearable packed full of Wear OS features, on-wrist AI, and fitness and health tools.

Customers start by purchasing one of the carrier's four plan options in 3, 6, or 12-month increments of time. There are no hidden fees or confusing contracts to worry about, and you can easily upgrade or downgrade your plan at will once the time allotment has run out. There's even a seven-day money-back guarantee that lets you try out the service with zero stress if you're having trouble committing.</p><p>Starting at $15 per month for three months of the introductory 5GB plan, all of Mint's plan options give you talk, text, and data on T-Mobile's vast 5G network, plus you get free calls to Mexico, Canada, and the UK. There are also a ton of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.androidcentral.com/mint-mobile-deals-promo-codes">Mint Mobile deals</a> that could get you a great Android phone for dirt cheap if you play your cards right.</p><p>If your network gets congested, you may notice slower speeds after 35GB on the Unlimited plan, but that's pretty common for prepaid carriers. Indeed, MVNOs aren't perfect, but these carriers remain nice options for students because they're simple, affordable, and allow for lots of flexibility. If that's what you're looking for in a phone plan, then Mint Mobile is an amazing choice.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-budget"><span>Best budget</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wV4LAyfoohDQzZwodU5Sf6" name="tello-phone-hand-169.jpg" alt="Tello homepage on phone" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wV4LAyfoohDQzZwodU5Sf6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1152" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="3-tello-5gb-2"><span class="title__text"><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/tello-mobile-review">3.

If you're really looking to cut costs, Tello's 5GB plan is a great choice, starting at just $10 per month and giving you access to T-Mobile's comprehensive 5G / 4G LTE network.</p><p>Tello Mobile also lets you completely customize your plan every month with no penalty. Only want to pay for 500 minutes of calling this month? You can do that. Need Unlimited data for a month to catch up on your favorite TV show? You can do that too. All of Tello's plans also come with a 5GB mobile hotspot, plus Wi-Fi calling support and free calls to over 60 countries worldwide.</p><p>Looking at the negatives, Tello's data speeds do tend to fluctuate during busy periods, and taxes aren't applied to your monthly rate until you get to the checkout page. All things said and done, however, these are small issues when you consider the low cost and flexibility offered by Tello's data plans.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-features"><span>Best features</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2730px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.26%;"><img id="WaZcCWyYBGc78hufQ2AYf4" name="Verizon-outside-169-2.jpg" alt="Verizon logo in city park" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WaZcCWyYBGc78hufQ2AYf4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2730" height="1536" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Verizon)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="4-verizon-welcome-unlimited-2"><span class="title__text">4.

Verizon switched to a mix-and-math perk system a few years ago and hasn't looked back, offering customers a wide range of excellent features, from Cloud Storage to streaming services and everything in between.</p><p>The Verizon Welcome Unlimited plan starts at $65 per month for a single line with AutoPay, although the price can drop considerably if you add multiple lines. The base plan includes unlimited talk, text, and data on the company's iconic 5G network, plus you get a three-year price lock guarantee. After you sign up for the base plan, you get to mix and match perks for $10 per month apiece.</p><p>These perks include things like Netflix subscriptions, Apple Music, Unlimited Cloud Storage, and more. The best part is that Verizon allows you to update your perks every month, which means you can adjust your plan features as needed every 30 days with zero hassle.</p><p>The problem is that Verizon's plan can get pretty expensive if you're not taking advantage of the multi-line discounts, and the base tier doesn't include much on its own. Still, it's a great option if you like consolidating your entertainment apps and don't mind bringing the family along.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-premium"><span>Best premium</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2047px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.23%;"><img id="tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP" name="t-mobile-retail-storefront-169.jpg" alt="T-Mobile retail storefront" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/tayKpSosAMQZjqacPBJVcP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2047" height="1151" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="5-t-mobile-experience-beyond-2"><span class="title__text">5.

The Experience Beyond plan is easily one of the Big Three carrier's best offerings if you can afford it, presenting customers with unlimited talk, text, and premium data every month alongside a true bounty of perks.</p><p>The plan starts at a steep $105 per month with AutoPay, but you get unlimited coverage with free subscriptions to Netflix, Apple TV Plus, and Hulu (with ads). The Experience Beyond plan also gives you an unlimited mobile hotspot and coverage (capped at 15GB of high-speed data) in over 200 countries worldwide. Those perks feel fairly standard for premium phone plans nowadays, but T-Mobile also throws in a few perks that you may not expect, such as free in-flight texting and Wi-Fi on select flights and a five-year price guarantee.</p><p>Sure, it's obviously too expensive for many students, but if you can make it work for you, T-Mobile's Experience Beyond plan is the gold standard of what a premium phone plan can look like in 2025.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-best-international"><span>Best international</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2033px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.27%;"><img id="xQ5Etz5K46TeAtHmnRaYqY" name="Ultra-mobile-tourist-sim-card.jpg" alt="Ultra Mobile SIM card" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xQ5Etz5K46TeAtHmnRaYqY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2033" height="1144" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Samuel Contreras / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><div class="buying-guide-block"><h3 id="6-ultra-mobile-12gb-2"><span class="title__text">6.

If you need to go beyond the international coverage included in your plan, Ultra also sells international call credits and a one-time roaming credit for five bucks apiece. Like most of the plans on this list, the 12GB tier also comes with a free mobile hotspot and Wi-Fi calling support.</p><p>Similar to Mint Mobile's buy-in-bulk system, members can pay $29 for a single month of the 12GB plan, or you can drop the price to as low as $20 monthly if you pay for a full year in advance. If you don't need 12GB of data every month, Ultra also offers preconfigured plans that starting at 4GB monthly.</p><h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-how-to-choose"><span>How to choose</span></h3><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2048px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.35%;"><img id="RvPmL3L4VMEj2z7g2cnEaT" name="google-pixel-9-pro-xl-12.jpg" alt="Pixel 9 Pro XL with a game running on the device" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RvPmL3L4VMEj2z7g2cnEaT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2048" height="1154" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apoorva Bhardwaj / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whether you're shopping for yourself or a tech-savvy high schooler, choosing the right student phone plan doesn't have a one-size-fits-all solution — it depends on the user. Does the student in question have a regular Wi-Fi connection? Do they need lots of data? Are they shopping on a budget? All of these questions should be addressed before you decide on one final wireless plan.</p><p><strong>Going with an MVNO carrier</strong> is convenient for students because you aren't typically locked into a long contract, which means you can adjust your plan from month to month to fit your needs. If you or your student has been a phone user in the past, check old usage statements to see how much time and data gets spent on devices each month. If you regularly use less than 10GB of data, for instance, then an unlimited plan really isn't necessary.</p><p>It can also be helpful to <strong>look at the entertainment perks</strong> included in the data plans. If you're already using Disney Plus, Netflix, Hulu, et al., you may be surprised at the number of wireless carriers that include free subscriptions with their phone plans.</p><figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2500px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.24%;"><img id="diVoXVMFuP9o9mogC7TRpM" name="samsung-galaxy-s25-ultra-camera-comparison-1" alt="Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra with the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S24 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/diVoXVMFuP9o9mogC7TRpM.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2500" height="1406" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Andrew Myrick / Android Central)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, <strong>consider if you need a new device</strong> with your data plan. If you don't care about buying phones unlocked, you can find some seriously good deals by purchasing a device through your wireless carrier. Companies like Verizon and Mint Mobile will hook you up with a cheap (or even free) Android phone for simply adding an eligible line to your account, and the savings get even better if you're able to process a trade-in.</p><p>All things said and done, there's no shortage of great phone plans for students, you just need to find the one that's right for you. Visible is my top pick because it balances the price of an MVNO with the perks of a Big Three carrier, but it's far from the only option. Simply ask yourself the questions laid out above and you'll be well on your way to a perfect wireless experience this school year.</p><ul><li><strong>Carrier deals: </strong><a href="https://www.verizon.com/deals/"><u><strong>Verizon</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.att.com/deals/"><u><strong>AT&T</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers"><u><strong>T-Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.mintmobile.com/deals/"><u><strong>Mint Mobile</strong></u></a><strong> | </strong><a href="https://www.visible.com/deals/"><u><strong>Visible</strong></u></a></li></ul> ]]></dc:content>
